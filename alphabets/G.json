Act is to be interpreted differently as against the word 'from' occurring in Section 138(a) of the N.I.

Even if the Limitation Act is held not applicable to the N.1 Act, the conclusion reached in (1999) 3 SCC 1 could still be reached with the aid of Section 9 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. Section 9 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 states that in any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of the General Clauses Act, 1897, it shall be sufficient to use the word 'from' for the purpose of excluding the first in a series of days or any other period of time and to use the word 'to' for the purpose of including the last in a series of days or any other period of time.

This Section would, therefore, be applicable to the N.I. Act. Thus, for the purpose of calculating the period of one month, which is prescribed under Section 142(b) of the N.I.

This presumption can be raised in favour of a person who has issued such a notice only when the prosecution has been launched on the basis of the said notice.  The presumption is a rebuttable presumption which can be rebutted by the Accused by pointing out that he had in fact not received the notice.  In the present case, the Appellant had issued a notice dated 14th July, 1995 which was returned back as unclaimed.  Thereafter, the Appellant had represented the cheque and on it being dishonoured had issued another notice dated 12th September, 1995.  Was it incumbent on the Appellant to have filed a complaint in the Court of Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Margao, on the basis of the receipt of the notice as unclaimed or could he have represented the cheque?  On receipt of such unclaimed notice, the party addressing the notice is certainly put in a quandry.  He has two options before him.  The first is to file the prosecution on the basis of the said notice and run the risk of the presumption being rebutted by the Accused in the trial.  The second option is to represent the cheque and nurture a hope that the notice would be duly served.  The presumption regarding the receipt of the notice can only be raised in the event the prosecution is launched on the basis of the notice.  In the present case, the presumption regarding receipt of the notice could have been raised had the Appellant filed the case on the basis of the notice dated 14th July, 1995.  As stated earlier, this presumption is a rebuttable presumption.  On filing cases on the basis of such rebuttable presumption, the Complainant always runs the risk of the Accused putting up a plea of not having received such a notice.  On putting up such a plea and on its acceptance by the Court, which often takes a considerably long time, the case of the Complainant would be dismissed and he would have no opportunity of issuing a fresh notice again as the dismissal of the case or the adjudication of the plea of non receipt would obviously be after a period of 6 months i.e. beyond the validity period of the cheque.  An unscrupulous drawer can resort to this modus operandi of seeing that the notice is returned back to the sender with an endorsement \"not claimed\" and in the trial raise a plea regarding non receipt of the notice.  Since the presumption is a rebuttable presumption, he would be elimently (ultimately) successful in rebutting the presumption and the result would be that the complaint regarding dishonour of the cheque would be dismissed.  The presumption available under Section 27 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 is available only when the case is instituted and it is not available as soon as the envelope is returned back with the endorsement \"unclaimed\" or like such other endorsements.  It, therefore, cannot lie in the mouth of the accused to contend that the earlier notice has been returned back as \"unclaimed\" and, therefore, a presumption was available in a proceeding which is filed on the basis of a subsequent notice.  To hold otherwise, would be to defeat the objects for which the provisions under Section 138 and onwards were introduced in the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.\n\n2001(1) ALL MR 846 (S.C.) and 1999(4) ALL MR 452 (S.C.) : 1999 ALL MR (Cri) 1845 (S.C.) - Referred.

                ],
                "description": "Evidence Act (1872), S.114 - Dishonour of cheque - Complaint - It is not necessary to over in complaint that service of notice was evaded or that accused had a role to play in the return of notice unserved.\n\nAccording to S.114 of the Evidence Act, read with illustration (f) thereunder, when it appears to the Court that the common course of business renders it probable that a thing would happen, the Court may draw presumption that the thing would have happened, unless there are circumstances in a particular case to show that the common course of business was not followed. Thus, Section 114 enables the Court to presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common course of natural events, human conduct and public and private business in their relation to the facts of the particular case. Consequently, the court can presume that the common course of business has been followed in particular cases. When applied to communications sent by post, Section 114 enables the Court to presume that in the common course of natural events, the communication would have been delivered at the address of the addressee. But the presumption that is raised under Section 27 of the G.C. Act is a far stronger presumption. Further, while Section 114 of Evidence Act refers to a general presumption, Section 27 refers to a specific presumption.  Section 27 gives rise to a presumption that service of notice has been effected when it is sent to the correct address by registered post. In view of the said presumption, when stating that a notice has been sent by registered post to the address of the drawer, it is unnecessary to further aver in the complaint that in spite of the return of the notice unserved, it is deemed to have been served or that the addressee is deemed to have knowledge of the notice. Unless and until the contrary is proved by the addressee, service of notice is deemed to have been effected at the time at which the letter would have been delivered in the ordinary course of business.  When a notice is sent by registered post and is returned with a postal endorsement \"refused\" or \"not available in the house\" or \"house locked\" or \"shop closed\" or \"addressee not in station,\" due service has to be presumed.  It is, therefore, manifest that in view of the presumption available under Section 27 of the Act, it is not necessary to aver in the complaint under Section 138 of the Act that service of notice was evaded by the accused or that the accused had a role to play in the return of the notice unserved.\t\t\t\t\t [Para 13,14]\n\nInsofar as the question of disclosure of necessary particulars with regard to the issue of notice in terms of proviso (b) of Section 138 of the Act, in order to enable the Court to draw presumption or inference either under Section 27 of the G.C. Act or Section 114 of the Evidence Act, is concerned, there is no material difference between the two provisions. When the notice is sent by registered post by correctly addressing the drawer of the cheque, the mandatory requirement of issue of notice in terms of Clause (b) of proviso to Section 138 of the Act stands complied with. It is needless to emphasise that the complaint must contain basic facts regarding the mode and manner of the issuance of notice to the drawer of the cheque. It is well settled that at the time of taking cognizance of the complaint under Section 138 of the Act, the Court is required to be prima Facie satisfied that a case under the said Section is made out and the aforenoted mandatory statutory procedural requirements have been complied with. It is then for the drawer to rebut the presumption about the service of notice and show that he had no knowledge that the notice was brought to his address or that the address mentioned on the cover was incorrect or that the letter was never tendered or that the report of the postman was incorrect. This interpretation of the provision would effectuate the object and purpose for which proviso to Section 138 was enacted, namely, to avoid unnecessary hardship to an honest drawer of a cheque and to provide him an opportunity to make amends.   [Para 15]\n\nThe requirement of giving of notice is a clear departure from the rule of Criminal Law where there is no stipulation of giving of a notice before filing a complaint. Any drawer who claims that he did not receive the notice sent by post, can, within 15 days of receipt of summons from the court in respect of the complaint under Section 138 of the Act, make payment of the cheque amount and submit to the Court that he had made payment within 15 days of receipt of summons (by receiving a copy of complaint with the summons) and, therefore, the complaint is liable to be rejected.  A person who does not pay within 15 days of receipt of the summons from the Court along with the copy of the complaint under Section 138 of the Act, cannot obviously contend that there was no proper service of notice as required under Section 138, by ignoring statutory presumption to the contrary under Section 27 of the G.C. Act and Section 114 of the Evidence Act.   [Para 17]"

It is certainly probable that when the postman went with the postal article for the first time that intimation was given and later when an attempt was made for second time that it was found that the accused was not available to be served with the said notice.  In such a situation, the onus was clearly on the accused in the light of the presumption available to the complainant under Section 27 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 and as stated by the Supreme Court in the case of K. Bhaskaran Vs. Sankaram Vaidhyan Balan (supra) that he was really not served and he was not responsible for such non-service.  In the light of that, the learned Judicial Magistrate, First Class was not right in dismissing the complaint for want of service of notice.  1999 ALL MR (Cri) 1845 (S.C.) - Followed.\t [Para 22]"

The condition precedent for the applicability of this section are firstly, that the service must be provided by the Act itself and secondly, that such \"service shall be deemed to be effected by properly addressing, prepaying and posting by registered post\". Unless the twin conditions are satisfied Section 27 of the General Clauses Act will not apply. In the present case the second condition is not satisfied and therefore the service of notice on the applicants cannot be presumed. Since the legislature has kept service by private courier outside the purview of the Section 27 of the General Clauses Act, therefore the Courts cannot implant such presumption of service into that section and rightly so because private courier services are privately run businesses without any authenticity of service.

                "description": "Penal Code (1860), S.11 - Trusts Act (1882), S.2 - Offence by 'Trust' - Liability of trustees - Petitioner trustees contended that Public Charitable Trust is neither a 'person' nor a 'company' as referred in S.141, hence, trustees cannot be prosecuted for offence committed by trust - Term 'person' is not defined under NI Act, however its S.26 clarifies that trust is a juristic person being capable of contracting - Trust of two or more trustees falls within ambit of \"association of persons\" - Even a trust having single trustee is to be construed as 'company' in terms of S.141 - Hence, those trustees who are in-charge of affairs of trust, are liable to be prosecuted. \n\nPublic Charitable Trust falls within the definition of the term 'person' as defined in Section 11 of the Indian Penal Code and Section 3(42) of the General Clauses Act. A cursory reading of S.26 of N.I. Act would go to show that it refers to every person capable of contracting. Undoubtedly, a Public Charitable Trust is capable of contracting under the Negotiable Instruments Act. A Trust is competent to issue cheques drawn as against the account maintained by the Trust. Thus, the Negotiable Instruments Act has recognised a Public Charitable Trust as a person capable of contracting and that is why the banking institutions, the Government and the customers have recognised such a Public Trust as a juristic person. Thus, Section 26 of the Negotiable Instruments Act obviates doubts, if any, and makes it crystal clear that a Public Trust is capable of contracting and thus capable of making a cheque or Bill of Exchange and so it is a juristic person for the purpose of the said Act.          [Para 23,25]\n\nIn Ramanlal Bhailal Patel Vs. State of Gujarat reported in 2008 (5) SCC 449, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has laid down two important elements for a group of persons to constitute an 'Association of Individuals' as defined in Section 141 of the Act. To repeat, the combination of individuals should have been on their own volition and secondly the said combination is for a common purpose. If both the above elements are available, then combination of such persons will be an 'association of individuals' in terms of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. So far as a Trust having more than one Trustee, there is combination of individuals. The said combination of individuals is on their own volition. If an individual agrees to be one of the Trustees, either by nomination or by election etc., then the combination is on his own volition. Apart from that, there will be at least a minimum of one common purpose in every Trust, which is the obligation imposed on the Trust. Thus, the Trust, being a combination of individuals, is an 'association of individuals' in terms of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. Thus, there can be no difficulty in holding that a Trust, having two or more trustees, is undoubtedly a company for the purposes of Sections 138 and 141 of The Negotiable Instruments Act. But difficulty will arise in respect of a Trust where there is a single Trustee. If there is a single trustee, obviously there is no combination of individuals. If it is eventually held that a Trust, having a single Trustee, is not a 'company', then the said Trustee cannot be prosecuted, whereas the Trust alone can be prosecuted for the offence committed by the Trust under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. But, on the contrary, if there are two or more Trustees, for the offence committed by the Trust, as we have concluded above, the Trustees can also be prosecuted provided they were in-charge of the day-to-day affairs and conduct of the Trust. If this interpretation is adopted, then it will lead only to absurdity. It is the basic principle of interpretation that an enactment cannot be interpreted so as to result in absurdity. To avoid such absurdity, we have to make purposive interpretation of the provisions of the Act so as to take forward the object of the Act.     [Para 48,49,50]\n\nConsidering the intention of the Legislature while bringing in Chapter XVII of the Negotiable Instruments Act and the fact that a Trust having two or more trustees will squarely fall within the ambit of 'association of individuals' which in turn will fall within the meaning of the term 'company', it can be said that a Trust having a single trustee should also be brought within the definition of the term 'company' and thus the expression 'Trust' should be read into the Explanation 'a' to Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act. If this interpretation is not given, certainly Sections 138 and 141 of the Act will not have force and life, so far as they relate to a Trust having a single Trustee. Further, if one holds that a Trust having two or more trustees is a 'company' falling within the sweep of Sections 138 and 141 of the Act, at the same time a Trust having a single trustee will not fall within the ambit of Sections 141 and 138 of the Act, the result, as is only an absurdity. In order to avoid the said absurdity and in order to give force and life to the provisions of Sections 138 and 141 of the Act, it is to be held that the expression 'company' as explained in Section 141 of the Act takes into its ambit a Trust having a single trustee also. In view of this interpretation, a Trust, having either a single trustee or two or more trustees, is a 'company' in terms of Section 141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.     [Para 66]"

Act uses the expression \"six months from the date on which it is drawn\". Once the word 'from' is used for the purpose of commencement of time, in view of Section 9 of the General Clauses Act, the day on which the cheque is drawn has to be excluded. The use of word \"from\" in Section 138(a) requires exclusion of the first day on which the cheque was drawn and inclusion of the last day within which such act needs to be done. In other words, six months would expire one day prior to the date in the corresponding month and in case no such day falls, the last day of the immediate previous month. Hence, for all purposes, the date on which the cheque was drawn, i.e., 31.12.2005 will be excluded and the period of six months will be reckoned from the next day i.e. from 1.1.2006; meaning thereby that according to the British calendar, the period of six months will expire at the end of the 30th day of June, 2006.

The word \"regulate\" is wide enough to confer power on the respondent to regulate either by increasing the rate, or decreasing the rate.\n\nIn the present case, the tariff incorporated in the PPA between the generating company and the distribution licensee is the tariff fixed by the State Regulatory Commission in exercise of its statutory powers. In such a situation it is not possible to hold that the tariff agreed by and between the parties, though finds mention in a contractual context, is the result of an act of volition of the parties which can, in no case, be altered except by mutual consent. Rather, it is a determination made in the exercise of statutory powers which got incorporated in a mutual agreement between the two parties involved.\n\nIn view of Section 86(1) (b) the Court must lean in favour of flexibility and not read inviolability in terms of the PPA insofar as the tariff stipulated therein as approved by the Commission is concerned. It would be a sound principle of interpretation to confer such a power if public interest dictated by the surrounding events and circumstances require a review of the tariff. The facts of the present case, would suggest that the Court must lean in favour of such a view also having due regard to the provisions of Sections 14 and 21 of the General Clauses Act, 1898.\n\n(2011) 11 SCC 34, AIR 1964 SC 1781 Ref. to. \t [Para 10,15,16]"

                "description": "Power to issue notification under S.49 - Can be exercised from time to time if circumstances so require - Relief by way of concession or rebate granted under can be curtailed or withdrawn by issuing another notification - Such exercise cannot be faulted on ground of promissory estoppel.\n\nThere being nothing repugnant to raising of public revenue in exercise of sovereign power of State to impose and collect taxes including electricity duty, in any provision of the Act of 1948 or the policy statement made in the notification granting rebate, the raising of public revenue by withdrawing or reducing exemption, cannot be said to be against the provisions of any statute.  It is relevant to notice that the new industrial units, which were being established in the hill areas, could not have compelled the Government to exercise power under Section 49 of the Act of 1948 in their favour, for grant of rebate/concession in electricity tariff.  Powers under Section 49 normally would be exercised by the State Government for industrial growth of an area and to generate employment opportunities for those who are residing in the area.  However, on change in the circumstances, the Government can always reconsider the matter and can either curtail or withdraw the benefit granted earlier.  The concept of the larger public interest introduced, before invocation of Section 21 of the General Clauses Act, in fact, amounts to amendment of the said provision, as notifications dated June 18, 1998 and January 25, 1999, issued under Section 49 of the Act of 1948, as well as notification dated August 7, 2000, issued under Section 24 of the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Reforms Act, 1999, are in the nature of legislations and, therefore, the principle of promissory estoppel would not apply to them.  [Para 14]\n\nThe purpose of the General Clauses Act is to place in one single statute different provisions as regards interpretations of words and legal principles which would otherwise have to be specified separately in many different Acts and Regulations.  Whatever the General Clauses Act says whether as regards the meaning of words or as regards legal principles, has to be read into every statute to which it applies.  Further, power to curtail and/or withdraw the notification issued under Section 49 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 giving rebate is implied under Section 49 itself on proper interpretation of Section 21 of the General Clauses Act.  By virtue of Sections 14 and 21 of the General Clauses Act, when a power is conferred on an authority to do a particular act, such power can be exercised from time to time and carry with it power to withdraw, modify, amend or cancel the notifications earlier issued, to be exercised in the like manner and subject to like conditions, if any, attached with the exercise of the power.  It would be too narrow a view to accept that chargeability once fixed cannot be altered.  Since the charging provision in the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 is subject to the State Government's power to issue notification under Section 49 of the Act granting rebate, the State Government, in view of Section 21 of the General Clauses Act, can always withdraw, rescind, add to or modify an exemption notification.  No industry can claim as of right that the Government should exercise its power under Section 49 and offer rebate and it is for the Government to decide whether the conditions are such that rebate should be granted or not.  [Para 13]\n\nThe legal effect would be that the finding recorded in (2008)2 SCC 777 that the notification dated 18-6-1998 and 25-1-1999 reducing the rate of rebate from 33.33% to 17% were bad in law will have to be regarded as not laying down correct proposition of law.  Thus, the petitioners in the present writ petition are not entitled to claim promissory estoppel against the Government and would not be entitled to any benefit on the basis of two Judge Bench judgment in (2008)2 SCC 777 referred to earlier. The petitioners cannot raise plea of estoppel against the notification dated August 7, 2000 reducing Hill Development Rebate to 0% as there can be no estoppel against the statute.

It may not be possible to insist that every officer in the chain be the same when the subsequent order is issued, but at least the officers who gave the main inputs to the Government and on the basis of whose opinion the first order was issued must be the same.

The incorporation of an earlier Act into a later Act is a legislative device adopted for the sake of convenience in order to avoid verbatim reproduction of the provisions of the earlier Act into the later. But this must be distinguished from a referential legislation which merely contains a reference or the citation of the provisions of an earlier statute. In a case where a statute is incorporated, by reference, into a second statute, the repeal of the first statute by a third does not affect the second. The later Act along with the incorporated provisions of the earlier Act constitute an independent legislation which is not modified or repealed by a modification or repeal of the earlier Act. However, where in later Act there is a mere reference to an earlier Act, the modification, repeal or amendment of the statute that is referred, will also have an effect on the statute in which it is referred. It is equally well settled that the question whether a former statute is merely referred to or cited in a later statute, or whether it is wholly or partially incorporated therein, is a question of construction.  [Para 31]\n\nIt is also well settled that the question as to whether a particular legislation falls in the category of referential legislation or legislation by incorporation depends upon the language used in the statute in which reference is made to the earlier decision and other relevant circumstances.

                "description": "Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act (1976), Ss.10, 11, 12, 13, 14 - Repeal of ULC Act - Applicability of S.6 of General Clauses Act - Intent of Parliament is not to completely wipe out or obliterate Principal Act - Hence, despite the repeal, certain rights and obligations are saved by force of S.6 of General Clauses Act - Section 6 attracted.\n\nPer S.C. Dharmadhikari and G.S. Kulkarni, JJ. (Majority) :-\n\nA perusal of the judgment in Bansidhar's Case [(1989) 2 SCC 557] and effect of repeal enacted by Section 6 of the General Clauses Act would show that a saving provision in the repealing statute is not exhaustive of the rights and obligations so saved or the rights that survive the repeal. The line of inquiry as has been repeatedly pointed out by the Honourable Supreme Court would be not whether the new Act expressly keeps alive the old rights and liabilities, but whether it manifests an intention to destroy them. Unless such an intention is manifested by the new Act, the rights and liabilities under the repealed Act will continue to exist by force of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. It is the repealing Act and not the Act repealed which is to manifest the contrary intention so as to exclude the operation of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. The silence of the repealing Act is consistent and not inconsistent with Section 6 applying. That is how we are of the opinion that if this line of inquiry is carried forward it would show that the Repeal Act did not manifest an intention contrary to Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. The nature of right that is claimed or in other words the privilege under exemption order is not absolute. The Honourable Supreme Court holds that the scheme of the Act seems to be to determine the ceiling area of each person with reference to the appointed day. Hence, the rights and obligations under the provision had to be determined with reference to the notified date. If that is so and in this case if the lands are in excess of ceiling limit and some of them may have vested in the State already, then, the exemption claimed from applicability of Chapter-III would not mean that the character of the lands is in any way altered or their status is changed. The date with reference to which the lands have become excess, thus cannot be ignored while determining the nature of the rights and privilege. All the more if such privilege or right is conditional as noted above. In these circumstances we see no reason to deviate from the principles in the case of Bansidhar (supra).\n\nWe are of the clear opinion that clauses (b) and (c) of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act are thus, clearly attracted. Therefore, the repeal will not affect the previous operation of the Principal Act or anything duly done or suffered thereunder.\n\nIf an intention was to the contrary then, there was no need for the Parliament to have save the validity of any exemption order under sub-section (1) of Section 20 of the Principal Act or any action taken thereunder and declare the same to be not affected by repeal of the Principal Act notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the contrary. There may have been cases before repeal of the Principal Act in which there was challenge to the exemption orders or to the conditions thereunder. Some of these challenges may have succeeded. The validity of the exemption order may have been put in issue and even such pronouncements of the court may affect the order granting exemption or any action taken thereunder. Now, because of Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act, it is apparent that the order or condition or action is not invalid. It is declared to be valid by the Repeal Act and, therefore, the repeal of the Principal Act was not to affect the validity of such an order. In other words during subsistence of the Principal Act and when it was in force the exemption order or condition thereunder or any action taken thereunder may have been declared invalid by a court of law. Now, notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the contrary the validity of exemption order is saved. That is saved expressly so as to not take away its legal effects. The intent is not to affect adversely the legal consequences flowing from such valid order. Hence, far from manifesting or demonstrating a contrary intention, Section 3 of the Repeal Act is consistent and in consonance with the applicability of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. In these circumstances we are of the view that the principle laid down in the afore noted cases including Bansidhar (supra) would squarely apply.\n\n(1989) 2 SCC 557 Rel.on.\n\n2009(4) ALL MR 51 Held not good law.     [Para 55,73,79,80,91]\n\nPer. S.C. Gupte, J. (Contra) :-\n\nFrom the Provisions of Repeal Act it is clear that apart from saving the validity of an exemption order under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act, the scheme of the Repeal Act is that every consequence of a person holding excess land under the Principal Act is done away with except in these cases:\n\n(i) Where the land is not only vested in, but taken possession of by, the State Government under the Principal Act;\n\n(ii) Where the land is vested, though possession is not taken, but payment is made by the State Government in respect of such land;\n\n(iii) Where there is a payment made to the State Government or an action taken under an exemption order under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act.\n\nThese provisions are clear and loud. They imply a complete repeal or obliteration of the law except in cases particularly provided for. But if and to the extent there is any ambiguity (thereby permitting external aids for interpretation of the repealing statute), we may have reference to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the repealing statute. The Objects and Reasons acknowledge a near unanimous public opinion that the Act has failed to achieve its objectives as expected. In these premises, the Repeal Act proposes a complete repeal without any reservation, saving only the consequences specially provided for.\n\nThe repealing statute in our case, as noted above, exhibits a contrary intention to not to save anything which is not expressly saved by the saving clauses contained in Sections 3 and 4 thereof.\n\nEven otherwise, assuming that Clauses (a) to (e) of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act were to apply to acts, or rights and liabilities, or proceedings under the Principal Act after the repeal, it is difficult to see how the exemption order can be withdrawn or provisions of Chapter III can be applied to such land upon withdrawal of exemption. The argument of the State is that by virtue of Clause (c) of Section 6, rights, privileges, obligations or liabilities under the repealed Principal Act, are saved. Clause (c) talks about any right, privilege, obligation or liability \"acquired, accrued or incurred\" under the repealed enactment. Mere existence of a right, which has not been \"acquired\" or \"accrued\" on the date of the repeal, would not get protection under Clause (c) of Section 6. So also a liability cannot be enforced under the provisions of the repealed statute unless the same is \"incurred\".   [Para 158,159,168,169]"

A substantive law is presumed to be prospective. It is one of the facets of rule of law. Section 92-A of the 1939 Act created a right and a liability on the owner of the vehicle. It is a statutory liability. Per se it is not a tortuous liability. Where a right is created by an enactment, in absence of a clear provision in the statute, it is not to be applied retrospectively.  [Para 9]\n\nNo reason has been assigned as to why the 1988 Act should be held to be retrospective in character. The rights and liabilities of the parties are determined when cause of action for filing the claim petition arises. As indicated hereinbefore, the liability under the Act is a statutory liability. The liability could, thus, be made retrospective only by reason of a statute or statutory rules. It was required to be so stated expressly by the Parliament. Applying the principles of interpretation of statute, the 1988 Act cannot be given retrospective effect, more particularly, when it came into force on or about 1.07.1989.\n\nReference to Section 6 of the General Clauses Act is misplaced. Section 217 of the 1988 Act contains the repeal and saving clause. Section 140 of the 1988 Act does not find place in various clauses contained in Sub-section (2) of Section 217 of the 1988 Act. Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, therefore, inter alia saves a right accrued and/or a liability incurred. It does not create a right. When Section 6 applies only an existing right is saved thereby. The existing right of a party has to be determined on the basis of the statute which was applicable and not under the new one. If a new Act confers a right, it does so with prospective effect when it comes into force, unless expressly stated otherwise. Section 140 of the 1988 Act does not contain any procedural provision so as to construe it to have retrospective effect. It cannot enlarge any right. Rights of the parties are to be determined on the basis of the law as it then stood, viz., before the new Act come into force. It is now well-settled that a change in the substantive law, as opposed to adjective law, would not affect the pending litigation unless the legislature has enacted otherwise, either expressly or by necessary implication. 1990 ACJ 751 (Kerala) and 1992 ACJ 192 (P & H) - Overruled.

Third defendant stepped into the witness box and denied that the notice has been tendered by the postman. Trial judge held that parties reside in close proximity in same block of tenements and upon denial of service of notice, landlord failed to establish service of demand notice. Appellate Bench of Small Causes reversed finding of Trial Judge.  Challenge in writ.  Held, finding of Appellate Bench does not warrant interference. Notice of demand was remitted by registered post to tenant, presumption of due and proper service finds recognition in Supreme Court judgments.  Presumption of service of a letter sent by registered post can be rebutted by addressee. In certain cases, unchallenged testimony of a tenant may be sufficient to rebut it, but where it is inherently unreliable, position would be different.  In instant case, third defendant stepped into witness box and deposed that notice has not been delivered to him.  Mother and sister of third defendant, also heirs of deceased tenant, were admittedly present at residence when third defendant was away at work. Though mother has expired, sister was still available to give evidence. However, evidence of sister was not adduced.  A material witness who was available for rebutting presumption was not produced in evidence.  Finding of fact arrived at by Appellate Bench is consistent with the law laid down by the Supreme Court. A bald statement by the addressee that he had not received a notice is in the facts of this case clearly not sufficient to rebut presumption of due service. Appellate Bench has considered evidence in considerable detail; has referred to postal endorsements of the concerned post offices in regard to the transmission of postal packets. This finding does not warrant interference in exercise of supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution.\t [Para 4,11,12]"

It states that the pending proceedings shall be continued in that Board or court as if the 2015 Act had not been passed. the use of the word \u2018any\u2019 before the board or court in Section 25 of the 2015 Act, would mean and include any court including the appellate court or a court before which the revision petition is pending. This is also apparent from the use of the words \u2018a child alleged or found to be in conflict with law\u2019. The word \u2018found\u2019 is used in past-tense and would apply in cases where an order/judgment has been passed. The word \u2018alleged\u2019 would refer to those proceedings where no final order has been passed and the matter is sub-judice. Further, Section 25 of the 2015 Act applies to proceedings before the board or the court and as noticed above, it would include any court, including the appellate court or the court where the revision petition is pending. In the context of Section 25, the expression \u2018court\u2019 is not restricted to mean a civil court which has the jurisdiction in the matter of \u2018adoption\u2019 and \u2018guardianship\u2019 in terms of clause (23) to Section 2 of the 2015 Act [\u201c(23) - \u201ccourt\u201d means a civil court, which has jurisdiction in matters of adoption and guardianship and may include the District Court, Family Court and City Civil Courts\u2019;\u201d]. The definition clause is applicable unless the context otherwise requires. In case of Section 25, the legislature is obviously not referring to a civil court as the section deals with pending proceedings in respect of a child alleged or found to be in conflict with law, which cannot be proceedings pending before a civil court. Since the Act of 2015 protects and affirms the application of the 2000 Act to all pending proceedings, it cannot be said that the legislative intent of the 2015 Act is to the contrary, that is, to apply the 2015 Act to all pending proceedings.\n\tConsequently, in light of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act read with Section 25 of the 2015 Act, an accused cannot be denied his right to be treated as a juvenile when he was less than eighteen years of age at the time of commission of the offence, a right which he acquired and has fructified under the 2000 Act, even if the offence was committed prior to enforcement of the 2000 Act on 01.04.2001. In terms of Section 25 of the 2015 Act, 2000 Act would continue to apply and govern the proceedings which were pending when the 2015 Act was enforced. (Paras 17, 18)"

But, so far as the provisions of Article 3 of Schedule I of the Bombay Court Fees Act is concerned, the grounds on which the Court can set aside an Award is not relevant, because the subject matter of the provisions of Bombay Court Fees Act is payment of Court fees on plaint, application, petition or memorandum of appeal and not the grounds on which the Court can grant reliefs to the applicant, plaintiff, petitioner or appellant. Therefore, the only provision of the 1940 Act referred to in Article 3 of Schedule I of the Bombay Court Fees Act is the provisions of Section 33 of the 1940 Act and bare comparison of that provision with the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act shows that the provision of section 33 of the 1940 Act is repealed and re-enacted in sub-section (1) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act with slight modification. Therefore, reference to the provisions of section 33 of the 1940 Act in Article 3 of Schedule-I of the Bombay Court fees Act has to be construed, in view of the provisions of Section 8 of the General Clauses Act, as reference to the provisions of Section 34 of the 1996 Act. So far as an appeal filed under Section 37 of the 1996 Act is concerned, perusal of section 37 shows that an appeal is provided to the appellate Court against an order setting aside the arbitral award or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under Section 34. Thus, the provisions of \"Article 3 of Schedule-I\" do not apply to an application or petition filed under section 34 of the 1996 Act, they will also not apply to the memorandum of appeal filed to set aside or modify an award made by the Arbitrator under the 1996 Act. In other words nothing contained in Article 3 of Schedule-I of the Bombay Court fees Act applies to an application, petition or memorandum of appeal to set aside or modify any Award made under the 1996 Act as it does not apply to an application or petition or memorandum of appeal to set aside or modify an Award made under the Arbitration Act, 1940. Perusal of the provisions of Section 8 of the General Clauses Act shows that \"references in any other enactment to a provision in a former enactment\" is to be construed as 'reference to re-enacted provision in the new enactment\" unless a different intention appears. The different intention may appear either in the new enactment or in the other enactment. [Para 11]"

The first day for the period of limitation is required to be excluded for the convenience of the parties and if the declaration of the result is delayed or is done late in the night, the candidate or elector would hardly get any time for presentation of the election petition.

                "description": "Computation of limitation of 45 days - Words \"within forty-five days from\" - Word \"from\" is used indicating the beginning - First day of the period is to be excluded.\n\nSection 9 of the General Clauses Act says that in any Central Act or Regulation made after the commencement of the General Clauses Act, 1897, it shall be sufficient for the purpose of excluding the first in a series of days or any other period of time, to use the word \"from\", and, for the purpose of including the last in a series of days or any period of time, to use the word \"to\". The principle is that when a period is delimited by statute or rule, which has both a beginning and an end and the word \"from\" is used indicating the beginning, the opening day is to be excluded and if the last day is to be excluded the word \"to\" is to be used. In order to exclude the first day of the period, the crucial thing to be noted is whether the period of limitation is delimited by a series of days or by any fixed period. This is intended to obviate the difficulties or inconvenience that may be caused to some parties. For instance, if a policy of insurance has to be good for one day from the 1st January, it might be valid only for a few hours after its execution and the party or the beneficiary in the insurance policy would not get reasonable time to lay claim, unless the 1st January is excluded from the period of computation.  [Para 12]\n\nIn order to apply Sec. 9, the first condition to be fulfilled is whether a prescribed period is fixed \"from\" a particular point. When the period is marked by terminus a quo and terminus ad quern, the canon of interpretation envisaged and Sec. 9 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 require to exclude the first day. The words \"from\" and \"within\" used in Sec. 81 (1) of the R. P. Act, 1951 do not express any contrary intention.  [Para 13]"

By notification issued under the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act a new clause, 16.3 (1a) was introduced. This clause specifically permitted a change in user. The tender for allotment of the plot was floated in November 2009 after the aforesaid amendment. Thus clause 20 and the new clause 16.3 (1a) clearly informed the CIDCO to permit a change of user. Thus the CIDCO was in fact vested with the power to permit change of user and there is no basis for the reasons stated in the impugned order that no permission for change of user could have been granted since there was no provision for allowing such change. The CIDCO as a planning authority was undoubtedly vested with the power to permit change of user of the land even though the land was allotted for commercial purposes.   [Para 15]\n\nEqually there is no merit in the contention that the subordinate officer of CIDCO had no authority to make a representation on its behalf that the user can be and is being permitted to be changed from commercial to commercial cum residential. It is not possible to accept the description of the Vice Chairman and Managing Director of CIDCO as a subordinate officer and a subordinate officer who was not entitled to make any representation.The rules permitted such change of user and the act of converting the change of user cannot be called ultra vires.   [Para 16]\n\nIt is not permissible for CIDCO on the principle of promissory estoppel to revoke the permission either on the ground of public interest which is not shown to have been attracted having regard to various actions which the petitioners have taken on the basis of the representation and the considerable investment and indebtedness which they have incurred. \t  [Para 18]\n\nThe power conferred by section 51, in terms can, be exercised if the planning authority is of the opinion that the permission must be revoked or modified having regard to a development plan. No such ground is stated by the respondents in the impugned order to the effect that the change of user was permitted contrary to the development  plan. In the present case the stand of the CIDCO that its earlier action was illegal is not tenable, since there was a provision for permitting change of user and that CIDCO is not entitled to invoke public interest particularly after the petitioners had invested large sum of monies in the project.

Any term in such a scheme that the employee shall not withdraw from the option once exercised, will be an agreement without consideration and therefore, invalid. Consequently, the employee can withdraw the offer (that is option exercised) before its acceptance. But if the contractual scheme gives the option to an employee to voluntarily retire in terms of the scheme and if there is no condition that it will be effective only on acceptance by the employer, the scheme gives an enforceable right to the employee to retire, by exercising his option. In such a situation, a provision in the contractual scheme that the employee will not be entitled to withdraw the option once made, will be valid and binding and consequently, an employee will not be entitled to withdraw from the option exercised.   [Para 11]\n\nHowever, where the scheme is statutory in character, its terms will prevail over the general principles of contracts and the provision of the Contract Act. Further, there will be no question of any \"consideration\" for the condition in the Scheme that the employee will not withdraw from the option exercised. Subject to any challenge to the validity of the scheme itself, the terms of the statutory scheme will be binding on the employees concerned, and once the option in exercised by an employee to voluntarily retire in terms of the Retirement Package contained in the Scheme, the employee will not be entitled to withdraw from the exercise of the option, if there is a bar against such withdrawal. Hence, when the special voluntary retirement package is a part of the General Insurance (Rationalization of Pay Scale and Other Condition of Service of Development Staff) Amendment Scheme, 2003, made by the Central Government in exercise of the power under Section 17-A of the General Insurance Business Insurance (Nationalisation) Act, 1972 scheme is statutory in character. Consequently, the provisions of the Scheme will prevail over the provisions of Contract Act or any other law or any principle of contract, and having regard to the binding nature of the scheme, the employee upon exercising the option, of VRS cannot withdraw from the same.

It is described perhaps as the most important and fundamental principle. Fairness and equality of treatment is an essential feature of administrative action. Arbitrariness in State decisions would be contrary to the basic rule of law and, therefore, unacceptable even when considered by the courts within the specified limitations of judicial review. The discretion vested with the authorities is to be exercised with great caution. Every power is expected to be exercised, fairly and reasonably. Absolute unguided power would essentially give rise to arbitrariness and if so exercised, it would vitiate the process as well as the decision. Administrative orders of wider ramifications should be supported by some reasons so as to reflect proper and objective application of mind. Unfettered powers might be struck down as unconstitutional if no safeguards for its control are provided. Where the power is exercised in disregard to the prescribed safeguards, it would be held that power has been exercised unlawfully. To put it simply, higher the power greater is the responsibility to act fairly, in public interest and to ensure good governance.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 23]"

It is not possible to accept the contention on behalf of the petitioner that the power to declare another candidate as elected is implicit within the power to declare the necessity of holding fresh elections of some or all of the assemblies.  It is not possible to infer from this last mentioned power, the power to declare another candidate as duly elected.  The said power can perfectly exist with a purpose without compelling the inference of an implied power to declare a particular candidate elected if the election of a returned candidate is set aside.  The power to declare the necessity of holding fresh elections of some or all of assemblies has been conferred to deal with variety of circumstances which may be dealt with by the Tribunal such as the illegalities effecting the entire election or a part the election.  In any case, existence of such a power does not lead to the inference that there is an implied power to declare a candidate other than the elected candidate as duly elected if the election is set aside.  Such a power to declare another candidate as elected is a specific power which might be considered to be a power to substitute the voters choice of who their representative should be and must be specifically conferred expressly and clearly.  For example, such a power has been specifically conferred on the High Court under Section 102 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.\n\nHeld, the power to declare another candidate elected is also not incidental to the power to declare the necessity of holding a fresh election.  The two powers are independent in intent and purpose.  The power sought to be inferred must be absolutely necessary for the exercise of the power expressly conferred, which is not the case here.  In any case, Article 49 of the Code of Comunidade which was enacted in 1961 by Legislative Diploma No.2070 specifically deals with the consequences of annulment of an election and provides that in such an eventuality the Comunidade must be convened once again for holding a new election.  There is no other provision in any other law which provides for an alternate consequence.  Thus, even if Article 716 is held to be attracted for the purpose of deciding the scope of the power of the Tribunal while dealing with an election dispute, the question whether the Tribunal has the power to declare another candidate elected or must invariably direct a fresh election, must be determined by the special provision, Article 49 and Article 716 may be allowed to operate only in areas where the Code of Communidades makes no provision.\t [Para 10,11]"

An enabling provisions cannot be equated to a provision requiring the Children's Court to decide the dispute or the question or liability. \t\t\t\t    [Para 12]"

Once such a right of appeal exists on the date of initiation of a proceeding and is sought to be taken away by an amendment during the pendency of the proceeding, the amending Act must be held to be prospective unless it is clearly intended to be retrospective. The amendment, unless it is retrospective, would not take away the right of an appeal which exists on the date of initiation of the proceedings. There is, however, a distinction between the right of an appeal and the forum of an appeal. Where during the pendency of a proceeding the forum to which an appeal lies is altered or changed, such an amendment would apply even to the pending proceedings and an appeal against a decision in the proceeding pending in the Trial Court would have to be filed in the new forum to which an appeal is provided for by the amending Act and not in the old forum. While there is a vested right of an appeal, there is no vested right of a forum of an appeal. The fora of an appeal must be determined on the basis of the date of decision or the date on which the appeal is filed.\n\nIn the present case, the forum of the appeal was changed by an amendment made in the year 1998. On 30th March, 2002 when the trial Court decided the suit, by the legislative amendment, the forum of an appeal had already been changed. That forum remained unchanged when the appeal was filed in June, 2002. The District Court was the forum provided for an appeal, both on the date of decision of the Trial Court, as well as the date on which the appeal was filed. Consequently, the High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain and try the appeal on the date when the suit was decided and also on the date the appeal was filed. For these reasons, the appeal is liable to be dismissed as incompetent.  [Para 7]"

Sixthly and finally, it is provided that the Registrar, after receiving the resignations from the majority of the members of the Board, shall assess the situation and decide the course of action in accordance with the provisions of the Act.\n\n\tThere is really nothing in the provision which suggests that the resignations tendered by members require no acceptance for taking effect and only resignations tendered by the office bearers require acceptance for them to be effective. The provision only makes a distinction between the members, which will include all office bearers (except Chairman) on one hand and the Chairman on the other, for the purposes of specifying the authority, to whom the resignations may be addressed and nothing further. The members of the Board, which will include the office bearers (except Chairman) may address their resignations to the Chairman. Since the Chairman cannot be address his resignation to himself, a provision is made to enable the Chairman to address his resignation to the Chief Executive Officer. However, upon harmonious construction of the provisions, it does appear that the resignations, whether of members including office bearers (except Chairman) or of the Chairman, are required to be placed in the meeting of the Board 'for consideration and acceptance.' Thus, the expression 'for consideration and acceptance' applies to both the resignations of members including office bearers (except Chairman) and resignation of the Chairman.\n\n\tSection 67(4), in its first and second part, merely provides for the authorities to whom the resignations are required to be addressed. However, the said provisions cannot be interpreted to mean that the authorities to whom the resignations are to be addressed, are authorities, who have been vested with the powers to accept the resignations. For example, the Chairman may resign by addressing his resignation to the Chief Executive Officer. However, the Chief Executive Officer is not the authority vested with the power to accept the resignation of the Chairman. The resignation has to be placed in the meeting of the Board for consideration and acceptance. By the same logic, therefore, it cannot be said that because the members, which will include, office bearers (except Chairman) may address their resignation to the Chairman, the Chairman is the authority vested with the power to accept such resignations or that there is no acceptance of such resignations even contemplated by the provisions in Section 67(4) of the said Act.\n\n\tSection 67(4) of the said Act makes a distinction between the resignations submitted by minority of the members of the Board and majority of the members of the Board, including the Chairman or otherwise. This is evident from the fifth and sixth part of Section 67(4) of the said Act. In the event the resignation is from majority of the members of the Board, including the Chairman or otherwise, such resignations have to be handed over to the Chief Executive Officer, who shall forward the same to the Registrar. The Registrar, upon receiving the resignations from the majority of the members of the Board, shall assess the situation and shall decide the course of action in accordance with the provisions of the Act. This portion of Section 67(4) makes no distinction between the resignations of office bearers on one hand and resignations of members on the other. Both the sets of resignations have been treated on the same plane. This portion, thus, does not make any distinction between resignations of members on one hand and the resignation of the Chairman on the other. Even these two sets of resignations have been treated on the same plane in fifth and sixth part of Section 67(4).\n\n\tThe distinction is broadly between the resignations from minority of the members of the Board and majority of the members of the Board. In the later eventuality, the resignations, whether addressed to the Chairman or to the Chief Executive Officer, have to be \"handed over\" to the Chief Executive Officer, who shall forward the same to the Registrar. Thereafter, it is for the Registrar to assess the situation and to decide the course of action in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The purpose of treating the resignations from majority of the members of the Board separately is quite obvious. In such a situation, the Registrar will have to take a call and decide the course of action in accordance with the provisions of the Act. Several options as contemplated under the Act, are available to the Registrar. The Legislature deemed it appropriate to leave the matter to the Registrar where the very governance of the society may be at stake on account of resignations from the majority of the members of the Board. \t\t\t\t [Para 31,33,37,39,40]"

                "description": "Appointment of Directors - Powers of Registrar u/S.67A of Goa Co-operative Societies Act - Not unguided - There are various inbuilt safeguards - Registrar cannot appoint any person of his choice from membership of society - He has to publish a notice inviting objections and consider same - Only as exception, when immediate action is required, such notice can be dispensed with - Even for such dispensation, cogent reasons must exist.\n\n\tThe power conferred on the Registrar under Section 67A is not for gaining control of the co-operatives, but to take such steps as may be necessary in the larger interest of the co-operatives and the members. Upon examination of Section 67A of the Act, it cannot be said that it confers unchecked and unguided arbitrary power on the Registrar. The scheme of Section 67A shows that there are various inbuilt safeguards on the exercise of the power, so that it does not result into an arbitrary exercise. Section 67A(1) opens with the words \"where the Registrar is satisfied\". The satisfaction of the Registrar has to be well informed, rational, transparent and fair. If the Registrar is satisfied that the new Board cannot be constituted he may suo motu or on an application appoint any member or members. However, the Registrar, cannot straight away proceed to appoint any person of his choice from the membership of the society. He has to publish a notice inviting objections and suggestions to the proposed order and consider all the objections and suggestions. This helps him to arrive at an informed decision. In the process, the Registrar also gives an opportunity to all the members of the Society to be part of the decision making. This is the most crucial aspect of the power under Section 67A. This safety valve ensures that the exercise is transparent, prudent and in interest of the cooperatives. The Legislature has however visualized a contingency where there is a need for speed in taking immediate corrective measures. There could be situations where it is not reasonably practicable to publish such a notice and the second proviso permits dispensation of notice. However, dispensing with notice has to be an exception, not a rule. The requirement of issuance of notice before issuance of an order is a crucial component of the scheme of Section 67A. Merely because the Legislature has provided for a rare eventuality, where safeguard can be departed from, does not mean that the safeguard can be dispensed with at will. Cogent reasons must exist for doing so.\t [Para 29]\n\n\tThus, there are safeguards in Section 67A of the Act of 2001 to ensure that it does not empower the Registrar with unguided, arbitrary or draconic powers. It is mandatory to call for objections and suggestions in respect of the proposed order, except where there is an immediate action required or that it is not reasonably practicable to issue such a notice. Keeping in mind the principles of democratic governance of the co-operatives, the proviso relating to dispensation of notice will have to be strictly construed. The grounds mentioned in the second proviso must genuinely exist and cannot be a mere ipsi dixit of the authority or that the grounds are artificially created. The order under section 67A must be a speaking order, so that there is transparency and good governance in the exercise of powers by the Registrar.\n\n1983 ALLMR ONLINE 240, (1992) Mh.L.J. 1118 Ref.to.\t [Para 31]"

The claim of concessions was transferred in the name of the petitioner. The Mines and Minerals (Regulation and Development) Act came to be applied to State of Goa on 1-10-1963. Right upto the time that Goa came to be liberated forming the Union Territory alongwith Daman and Diu, on or about 19th December, 1961, it was under Portuguese rule. On and from that date till 5th March, 1962, there remained what is known as interregnum, during which the Portuguese laws were not applying at all. Afterwards, some of the laws did govern the rights of the parties in the Territory and possibly, the laws relating to mines and decrees passed by the Portuguese Government from time-to-time were holding the field till Mines and Mineral Act came to be applied on and from 1st October, 1963. The Application for mining concession was made on 2-2-1962. all the fees came to be paid on 1-2-1963 prior to application of Mines and Minerals Act was applicable to State of Goa. The application was filed during interregnum what followed was nothing else but different stages at which the State authorities as well as the petitioner were required to do something under the Mining Laws.\n\nHeld, that the petitioner had no accrued right for mining concession saved by S.4(2) of the Regulation.

This is material as under Section 4 of the Act, even if the land was not held on lease, if a person was lawfully cultivating the land on or after 1st July, 1962, and before the commencement of this Act, that is 8th February, 1965, such a person is also deemed to be a tenant.

                "description": "Question of tenancy - Jurisdiction of Mamlatdar to decide - He can grant a negative declaration to the effect that a particular person is/was not a tenant when such a question is referred to him for his decision.\n\nWhen the wordings in the section are clear to the effect that the Mamlatdar has to decide about the tenancy of a concerned person, the expression \"If any question arises whether any person is or was a tenant.....\" can not have a meaning that the mamlatdar is not authorized to issue a negative declaration that the person is not a tenant. This expression, is clear that when there is a dispute or doubt over the tenancy of a person, then the Mamlatdar shall decide such question after conducting a due enquiry to establish the same. Therefore, if the conclusion of the Mamlatdar, on enquiry, is that a particular person is not a tenant, he is bound to declare such a person that he is not a tenant. The expression \"is or was tenant\" in Section 7 of the Goa Tenancy Act which would include the positive declaration as well as the negative declaration. If the observations made by the Division Bench of the High Court are accepted, it would then mean that if a person approaches the Mamlatdar to declare him as a tenant or on the application of a landlord for a decision on the tenancy of his occupant, the Mamlatdar ultimately reaches to a conclusion that the concerned person whose tenancy has to be decided is not a tenant, he has to refrain from taking any decision and decline to exercise his jurisdiction. Such a situation would be unacceptable, untenable and a sheer waste of time of the Mamlatdar to conduct a detailed enquiry under Section 7 of the Goa Tenancy Act on the application filed before it. This, cannot be the intention of the Legislature to create such an ambiguous position, which would result in a lengthy procedure, that might ultimately yield no result.   [Para 5]\n\nIt is true that under Section 4(1) of the Goa Tenancy Act, the Mamlatdar is conferred with jurisdiction to declare the category of person mentioned therein is or was not a tenant in respect of the disputed property. But if we read Section 7 and the objects and reasons of the Act and considering the fact that for a limited purpose the Mamlatdar is conferred with such power to declare the negative declaration in respect of the certain category of persons under Section 4(1) of the Goa Tenancy Act, it cannot be said that while deciding the question under Section 7 of the Goa Tenancy Act, the jurisdiction of the Mamlatdar to declare that the concerned person is or was not a tenant is ousted. Accordingly, we are of the view that the High Court was not justified in holding that a Mamlatdar is not conferred under Section 7 of the Goa Tenancy Act to deal with and decide whether the concerned person is a tenant or not a tenant in respect of the disputed property.  \t\t\t\t [Para 12]\n\nAgain it is needed to be mentioned that the jurisdiction under Section 7 of the Goa Tenancy Act is not confined to cases where the relationship of the landlord and tenant is admitted. In fact, it is only where the said relationship is alleged by one party and denied by the other that the question falls to be considered and the decision of the question is left exclusively to be determined by the Mamlatdar under the provision of the Act. It is likely that a trespasser would thereby be able to prolong litigation between him and the owner of the property by frivolously raising a plea that he is a tenant or a protected tenant; but, on the other hand, a landlord may also frivolously allege that a tenant is a trespasser. The only forum that can deal with this plea is the Mamlatdar. If he rejects the plea, then only the dispute between the owner and the trespasser would be triable by the ordinary Civil Court; but otherwise, the Mamlatdar alone would decide the dispute in so far as it falls within the purview of the Act. The jurisdiction of the Mamlatdar is not confined to cases where the question is whether a person is or was a tenant in respect of the disputed property.   [Para 13]"

                "description": "Bar of jurisdiction of Civil Court - Suit for injunction by tenant against person claiming to be tenant of same landlord - Jurisdiction of Civil Court to entertain suit is not barred.\n\nConsidering the tone and tenor of the entire Chapter II and on a close scrutiny of the various sections contained therein it can be seen that the relief provided under S. 8-A in favour of the tenant can be granted by the Mamlatdar only against the landlord and not against any other person. The reliefs provided under S.8-A are akin to the reliefs under S.38 of the Specific Relief Act. S. 8-A(1) can be invoked by a tenant whose possession is threatened by a landlord by approaching the Mamlatdar for an order safeguarding his right to possession. Therefore the reliefs provided under the Act in favour of the tenant can be granted only against the landlord by the Mamlatdar and not against any other person other than the landlord, except those persons who step into the shoes of the landlord. As per S.58(2) what has been excluded from the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is the matter which has to be settled, decided or dealt with by the Mamlatdar under this Act. Matter to be dealt with under S.8A as is a matter arising between landlord and tenant. The reliefs provided under S.8-A can be exercised only against the landlord and not against any other person including those persons who set up rival tenancies. It follows that a suit for injunction by a tenant against a person claiming rival tenancy is not barred by S.58(2) r.w. S.8A.  [Para 10,11]"

Therefore, any person lawfully cultivating the land of another person becomes a tenant irrespective of the fact whether there was any lease executed in favour of such a person.\n\n(d)\tThere cannot be a termination of tenancy or surrender of tenancy except in accordance with Sections 9, 10 and 11 of the Tenancy Act.

In fact there cannot be a surrender after the vesting under section 18-A of the Tenancy Act. The Tenancy Act prohibits a tenant purchaser from transferring the land vested in him without prior permission of the Mamlatdar. Thus, on the face of it, the compromise was illegal and even in exercise of administrative powers of sanctioning compromise, the Administrative Tribunal ought not to have sanctioned such compromise which is completely in breach of provisions of the Tenancy Act. The Administrative Tribunal cannot permit compromise which is per se contrary to law. The Tenancy Act has been brought on the statute book as a part of agrarian reforms. Therefore, under the Tenancy Act, there is no provision permitting a deemed purchaser to surrender his rights. The tenancy of an ordinary tenant can be determined only in accordance with the provisions of the Tenancy Act. All these protections are made a part of the Tenancy Act with a view to ensure that tenants are not either tempted or forced to give up their rights under the Tenancy Act. Any compromise or agreement recorded by any Court or tribunal by which a tenant or a tenant who is a deemed purchaser surrenders or gives up his right, title or interest is without jurisdiction.

This expression, is clear that when there is a dispute or doubt over the tenancy of a person, then the Mamlatdar shall decide such question after conducting a due enquiry to establish the same. Therefore, if the conclusion of the Mamlatdar, on enquiry, is that a particular person is not a tenant, he is bound to declare such a person that he is not a tenant. The expression \"is or was tenant\" in Section 7 of the Goa Tenancy Act which would include the positive declaration as well as the negative declaration. If the observations made by the Division Bench of the High Court are accepted, it would then mean that if a person approaches the Mamlatdar to declare him as a tenant or on the application of a landlord for a decision on the tenancy of his occupant, the Mamlatdar ultimately reaches to a conclusion that the concerned person whose tenancy has to be decided is not a tenant, he has to refrain from taking any decision and decline to exercise his jurisdiction. Such a situation would be unacceptable, untenable and a sheer waste of time of the Mamlatdar to conduct a detailed enquiry under Section 7 of the Goa Tenancy Act on the application filed before it. This, cannot be the intention of the Legislature to create such an ambiguous position, which would result in a lengthy procedure, that might ultimately yield no result.   [Para 5]\n\nIt is true that under Section 4(1) of the Goa Tenancy Act, the Mamlatdar is conferred with jurisdiction to declare the category of person mentioned therein is or was not a tenant in respect of the disputed property. But if we read Section 7 and the objects and reasons of the Act and considering the fact that for a limited purpose the Mamlatdar is conferred with such power to declare the negative declaration in respect of the certain category of persons under Section 4(1) of the Goa Tenancy Act, it cannot be said that while deciding the question under Section 7 of the Goa Tenancy Act, the jurisdiction of the Mamlatdar to declare that the concerned person is or was not a tenant is ousted. Accordingly, we are of the view that the High Court was not justified in holding that a Mamlatdar is not conferred under Section 7 of the Goa Tenancy Act to deal with and decide whether the concerned person is a tenant or not a tenant in respect of the disputed property.  \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 12]\n\nAgain it is needed to be mentioned that the jurisdiction under Section 7 of the Goa Tenancy Act is not confined to cases where the relationship of the landlord and tenant is admitted. In fact, it is only where the said relationship is alleged by one party and denied by the other that the question falls to be considered and the decision of the question is left exclusively to be determined by the Mamlatdar under the provision of the Act. It is likely that a trespasser would thereby be able to prolong litigation between him and the owner of the property by frivolously raising a plea that he is a tenant or a protected tenant; but, on the other hand, a landlord may also frivolously allege that a tenant is a trespasser. The only forum that can deal with this plea is the Mamlatdar. If he rejects the plea, then only the dispute between the owner and the trespasser would be triable by the ordinary Civil Court; but otherwise, the Mamlatdar alone would decide the dispute in so far as it falls within the purview of the Act. The jurisdiction of the Mamlatdar is not confined to cases where the question is whether a person is or was a tenant in respect of the disputed property.   [Para 13]"

Precisely in this case petitioners only claimed the statutory protection under the Mundkar Act and it was an error to read as denial of title of the landlord.  In fact they accepted the title and claimed protection.  Section 15 of the Mundkar Act gives right to a mundkar to purchase the mundkarial house and to a limited extent land below the house.  This is on payment to the landlord.  Thus there is recognition of title by the mundkar of the landlord.  Position can be visulised under various statutes giving protection to weaker community persons.  The question involved in such proceedings is very limited as in the present case whether petitioners can get protection of Mundkar Act.  If it is held that they get protection then legal consequences follow.  But claiming of such protection cannot amount to denial of title.\t  [Para 8]"

Clauses 2 to 4 of Article 80 provide or cater to a situation which may arise after the increase in the rent under Clause 1 of Article 80.  Clause 1 of Article 80 provides increase in the rent either by mutual consent or by valuation under Article 107.  Clause 1 does not contemplate any unilateral increase in the rent.  It is not averred in the plaint that the increase in the rent demanded by the Plaintiffs was as a result of either mutual consent or valuation under Article 107.  That being the case, the very foundation of the Plaintiffs case is weakened.

For example a non-residential premises can be let out for commercial purpose for running a shop, office, restaurant, hotel, cinema and godown for storing of the goods etc. If it is specified in the lease deed that the premises be used for a particular commercial purpose then the change of use of the premises falling in another category of purpose would amount to change of user of the building falling within the four corners of S.22(2)(b)(ii) of the Act and the landlord would be entitled to seek eviction of the tenant for having changed the use of the suit premises for a purpose otherthan for which it was let out. When the use of the building is identified in the lease deed as an 'office,' it would be taken that the parties had used the expression 'office' in the sense in which the 'office' is understood in common parlance or as indicated by its dictionary meaning. The building was taken on rent for use as an 'office' in which the appellant started transacting its banking activities and continued to do so till it shifted its banking activities in the new building. The suit premises ceased to be occupied as an office and were being used as a godown, which was a different purpose than the one identified in the lease deed. The story put forth by the Bank that it had restored its banking activities in the suit premises by carrying on pigmy bank accounts and taking of electrical bills has rightly been discarded. Even if it is so assumed for the sake of argument, even then the appellant has failed to show that it had a valid permission for carrying on its banking activities at the suit premises. Appellant had already shifted its branch office for the banking activities and it has failed to show that it had the necessary permission from the Reserve Bank of India to carry on with its banking activities at the suit premises as well.\t\t [Para 23,28,29]\n\nThe shifting of the activities from office purpose to godown purpose is a change of use of premises. It is not shifting of the business from one trade to another trade.   [Para 30]"

In the instant case the default is for a period of more than four years. The default is consistent and persistent even inspite of clear provisions of law that the tenant is required to pay the rent during the pendency of the proceedings. The tenant did deposit the rent, but after cantankerous contest and just prior to the passing of the Order by the Additional Rent Controller and that the failure to deposit the rent can, by no stretch of imagination, be said to be bona fide.

In fact, a tenant who ceases to occupy a building for a continuous period of four months for valid reasons, can place the same before the Court which can be considered under Section 22(2)(f) of the Act and this will take care of tenants who are temporarily transferred from the place where the suit premises is situated. For the application of section 22(2)(f), the tenant has to cease to occupy the building for a continuous period of four months without reasonable cause which means that if reasonable cause is there for not occupying the suit premises for a continuous period of four months, it would not furnish ground for eviction. When the tenant's case is that he was physically occupying the same, mere animus poscedendi without actual occupation would not be sufficient. Even if it be assumed that the luggage of the tenant continued in the suit premises, that fact, by itself, would not be sufficient to hold that the tenant had continued to occupy the suit premises.  [Para 7]\n\nThe tenant in the case had categorically affirmed that he was in occupation of the suit premises. But the relevant evidence in the nature of production of ration card, evidence of persons who visited him during the relevant period, receipt of correspondence during the said period at the address of suit premises, electricity and water bills and such other evidence was never placed by the tenant before the Court. His name was also not found in the electoral roll. Electricity connection was cut and it was difficult for tenant to occupy the premises without electricity since the premises was in the basement. Thus there was no evidence to show any occupation and the landlord  was entitled to evict the tenant.  [Para 7]"

The whole purpose behind this obligation on the landlord is that the tenant is able to enjoy the premises without inconvenience to him.  There may be cases where the tenanted premises cannot be used at all unless immediate repairs are carried out and a few instances of the same can be total or partial collapse of the roof, house-breaking by a thief either breaking of the wall or the door and window and instances of such nature.  If the repairs are not immediately attended to, the tenanted premises cannot be used properly which may result in terrible inconvenience to the tenant.  For such exceptional cases the Rent Tribunal will certainly have jurisdiction to grant interim relief even though there may not be any specific provision to that effect under Section 33 of the said Act.  Courts and Tribunals have inherent power to take action of preserving the subject-matter of the litigation before them.  Therefore, in certain cases if no immediate relief is granted, the remaining tenanted premises may be in danger of total collapse.  It would be too much to expect in such type of cases that the tenant should wait for the final order which normally takes quite some time with usual tactics adopted by the parties.  Of course, this power to grant interim relief shall be exercised by the Rent Tribunal only in such cases where there is complete justification for granting such interim relief.  It is not to be granted as a matter of routine, but only upon the party making a strong case.  This power has to be used sparingly in exceptional cases only.  [Para 4]"

On this aspect the evidence of the plaintiff has gone absolutely unchallenged.  The plaintiff had stated that his house was an ancestral house.  He had further stated that by reconstruction it had greatly affected the exterior look of the house.  He had also stated that by virtue of the said reconstruction it had also affected separately the value of the house.  Although the defendant might have incurred some expenditure for the said reconstruction and additions of rooms, looking at it from plaintiffs angle that expenditure instead of enhancing the value of the house, has diminished the same.  It is to be noted that there are many owners of houses who like to maintain their ancestral houses externally as they are, either because of family pride or sentimental value or aesthetic beauty or antiquity which in this case the defendants have impaired materially by the said reconstruction.\n\nFrom whatever angle one looks at the case of the plaintiff, in the first suit, the plaintiff was certainly entitled for a decree of eviction against the defendants, under Section 22(2)(c) of the Act.

The word \"fifteen\" came to be substituted in place of the word \"four\" by virtue of amendment, which came into force as from 5.5.1994, in terms of Goa Buildings (Lease, Rent and Eviction) Control (Amendment) Act 1993 published in the Official Gazette Series I, No. 5 dated 5/5/1994. Except for the change of the period from four years to fifteen years, there is no other change in the said provision. There is no dispute that the expression \"newly constructed building\" was there in that provision even prior to the amendment of the said clause (c). The amendment does not add the words \"as from the date of coming into force of this amendment\" after the expression \"newly constructed building\". The expression \"newly constructed building\" cannot be read literally to mean a recently constructed building. The entire clause (c) should be read. Newly constructed building means a building in respect of which a period of fifteen years has not expired from the date of completion of its construction. Prior to coming into force of the amendment, newly constructed building meant a building which had not completed four years from the date of completion of its construction. The meaning of newly constructed building, for the purposes of the Rent Control Act, has changed after the said amendment. Therefore, the submission of learned Counsel for the defendant that the word 'newly' means from the date of amendment i.e. from 5/5/1994 is without merit. \t\t\t     [Para 23]"

Section 3 of the Rent control Act does not speak about accrual of any substantive right as a statutory tenant, under the Act but it deals with the non-applicability of the Act to certain buildings. The defendant had a right to take advantage and enjoy the said statutory protection as long as the provision remained in force and was applicable to it. As soon as the said provision changed, the defendant cannot claim to continue to have the old statutory protection. It was another thing if the plaintiff had filed the suit when the provision of Section 3(1)(c) of the Rent Control Act had the word \"four\" instead of \"fifteen\". In that case, the defendant could have taken advantage of the said provision to resist the eviction by the plaintiff.\n\nSection 3 of the Rent Control Act, does not create any substantive rights in the tenant but it only provides for some protection or benefit, in certain eventualities mentioned therein. It imposes certain conditions for application of the Rent Control Act. The said protection or benefit can be utilized as long as it exists but a party cannot claim a vested right in the same and as soon as the said protection or benefit is taken away, the party cannot claim the same on the ground that it was previously existing. The plaintiff had not filed the suit prior to 5/5/1994, but had filed it on 19/3/1996. The beneficial provision as was existing on 19/3/1996, would apply.\n\nMere protection/benefit given by the provision does not give arise to any vested right. Therefore, merely because prior to 5/5/1994, the Rent Control Act did not apply to any newly constructed building for a period of four years from the date of completion and because the building consisting of suit premises had already completed the said period of four years, in or about 1989, it cannot be said that on account of the said protection of non-application of the Rent Control Act, a vested right, as protected tenant, accrued in favour of the plaintiff. If any proceedings for eviction were filed against the defendant prior to 5/5/1994, the defendant could have taken benefit of the said protection. However, as from 5/5/1994, the said provision of Clause (c) of Section 3(1) of the Rent Control Act changed and as per the amended provision, nothing in the Rent Control Act applies to any newly constructed building for a period of 15 years from the date of its completion. Admittedly, the building consisting of the suit premises was completed in December 1984. The suit was filed on 19/3/1996. The period of 15 years from the date of completion of the building had not expired as on the date of filing of the suit. Therefore, the Rent Control Act cannot apply to the suit premises.\n\nAIR 1960 SC 936, (1984) 1 SCC 206, AIR 1984 Bom.144, (2003) 2 SCC 577 Disting.\n\nAIR 1995 SC 1781 Rel. on. \t\t\t\t\t \t    [Para 23,24,30]"

After giving the background regarding how this lease deed came to be executed, the terms of lease are narrated in the lease deed and while giving the background of this lease deed, it must be noted that sometimes the suit premises is described as 'shop' and sometimes as 'room'.  While laying down the specific conditions of agreement with respect to lease, the term used is 'leased premises'.  These conditions are from Page No.66 to 68.  So, it appears that the premises is described not only as a shop, but even as room.  Therefore, it cannot be said that the parties intended to treat that premises only as shop premises.  When the wider term 'room' is used time and again for the description of the premises, then, the meaning cannot be restricted by describing the premises only as a shop.  If the parties had intended to treat that premises only as shop, then throughout this document the premises would have been described as shop and shop only.  But sometimes the premises is described as room and specially in condition (ix), neither the term 'shop' nor the 'room is used but the term is 'lease premises'. [Para 15,16,18]"

In the instant case the default is for a period of more than four years. The default is consistent and persistent even inspite of clear provisions of law that the tenant is required to pay the rent during the pendency of the proceedings.

The conclusion regarding strong suspicion about the commission of offence can be arrived at only when the Court finds existence of such factual ingredients alleged against a person.  [Para 6]\n\nClause 4(i) of the order of 1975 requires that no person should sell or abet the sale of kerosene oil to any person at a price in excess of the price notified by the Government.  The materials, therefore, should disclose that the accused person has either attempted to sell or abet the sale of kerosene at the price in excess of the price notified.

The inquiry under Section 14(3), pursuant to the claim by the Government, can therefore, be held even after promulgation of record of rights in respect of any land.

Section 96 does provide that the person acquiring any right in the manner specified thereunder, as well as 'otherwise' to inform about the same to the Talathi. According to the Rule of 'ejusdem generis' the word 'otherwise' has to be understood.

In other words, the information that is required to be collected by the Talathi is in relation to the properties claimed by private persons or belonging to the private persons. The local inquiry by Talathi under Rule 6 does not include the claim of the Government or in relation to the Government land.  [Para 8]"

As Section 14(3), on the face of it, does not provide for any such restriction, on plain reading of Chapter VIII, with Rules 6 and 7 of the said Rules, does not, in any manner, suggest any such restriction on inquiry under Section 14(3). In fact, any such interpretation of Section 14(3) would amount to reading something in Section 14(3) which has not been provided for by the Legislature in its wisdom. The inquiry under Section 14(3), pursuant to the claim by the Government, can therefore, be held even after promulgation of record of rights in respect of any land.  [Para 5]\n\nSection 96 in the said Chapter VIII, speaks about acquisition of rights only. It does not speak about existing right or obligation of any person to inform about such existing rights to the Talathi. It is only when a person acquires right by way of succession, survivorship, inheritance or partition, purchase, mortgage, gift, lease or otherwise, any right as holder, occupant, mortgagee, landlord, tenant or Government Lessee of any land that such person should inform about the acquisition of such right. Section 96 does provide that the person acquiring any right in the manner specified thereunder, as well as 'otherwise' to inform about the same to the Talathi. According to the Rule of 'ejusdem generis' the word 'otherwise' has to be understood.  [Para 7]\n\nRule 6 of the said Rules does not provide that Talathi before preparing the draft of the index in Form III has to collect information by making local inquiry, but such inquiry cannot be beyond the scope of Sections 96 and 97. In other words, the information that is required to be collected by the Talathi is in relation to the properties claimed by private persons or belonging to the private persons. The local inquiry by Talathi under Rule 6 does not include the claim of the Government or in relation to the Government land.  [Para 8]"

The agreement was entered into when Diploma No.1952 was in force and under the said Diploma, mundkar was required to render services like watch and ward duties for the purpose of agriculture and the said concept of mundkar as propounded in the said Diploma was retained in the temporary legislation, namely, The Goa, Daman and Diu (Protection of Mundkars, Agricultural Labourers and Village Artisans) Act, 1971, which was finally replaced by the Act of 1975.  On the appointed date the applicant did satisfy the said requirements and as such was certainly lawfully residing with the consent of the bhatkar with a fixed habitation in the dwelling house.  In view of the provisions of S.4 notwithstanding the conditions in the Agreement of 1969 permitting the applicant to reside in the barrack constructed by him for 15 years, only at the end of which the barrack would belong to the Bhatkar, the occupation of the said barrack by the applicant as on 12th March 1976 i.e. the appointed date and thereafter would be that of a mundkar and, therefore, he would be entitled to register himself as mundkar of the barrack under Section 29(4) of the Act.

S.22(1)(g) of the Rent Act.\n\nMerely because a person has claimed the right to reside in a mundkarilal house, it cannot be said that he has denied the title of the bhatkar.  In fact he accepts the title but claims protection of the Mundkar Act.  Precisely in this case petitioners only claimed the statutory protection under the Mundkar Act and it was an error to read as denial of title of the landlord.  In fact they accepted the title and claimed protection.  Section 15 of the Mundkar Act gives right to a mundkar to purchase the mundkarial house and to a limited extent land below the house.  This is on payment to the landlord.  Thus there is recognition of title by the mundkar of the landlord.  Position can be visulised under various statutes giving protection to weaker community persons.  The question involved in such proceedings is very limited as in the present case whether petitioners can get protection of Mundkar Act.  If it is held that they get protection then legal consequences follow.  But claiming of such protection cannot amount to denial of title.\t  [Para 8]"

Since the plaintiff has sought the relief of perpetual injunction against the defendants, it is for him to show that his cowshed and fencing which were destroyed by the defendants, were within the permissible limits mentioned in sub-clause (i) (a) and (b) of clause (i) of Section 2. Once the plaintiff proves this fact, then he is entitled to be protected so far as his dwelling house including the cowshed are concerned. In that event, the defendants, even though they have acquired the land occupied by the plaintiff's cowshed under a Gift Deed, cannot demolish the same in order to carry out the construction of a road.  [Para 6]\n\nThe questions as to what is the extent of areas of the dwelling house of the plaintiff as a mundkar and whether the fencing and cowshed of the plaintiff are within or outside the said area are essentially the questions which are, under the Mundkar Act, required to be settled, decided or dealt with by the Mamlatdar or the Collector. The jurisdiction of the Civil Court to decide the said questions is clearly barred by Section 31(2) of the Mundkar Act. Consequently the Civil Court cannot grant the relief of perpetual injunction to the plaintiff, assuming that the cowshed and the fencing are within the area of permissible limit stated in Section 2(i) (i) of the Mundkar Act. The order of Court which granted the decree of perpetual injunction in favour of the plaintiff results in failure of justice since there is material irregularity.  [Para 7,9]"

[Para 6]\n\nIn instant case a person filed an application for registration of his name as mundkar.  He averred that he was mundkar of the landlady (since deceased).  The non-applicant objected on ground that he was the bhatkar and the lady was only usufractuary.  She had given part of the house on rent to the applicant.  The applicant had never claimed to be mundkar of the non-applicant or that he was inducted in the suit premises by the lady with the consent of the bhatkar or that she was acting or purported to act on behalf of the bhatkar.  The lady was enjoying the suit property as usufruct during her lifetime in pursuance of a will and on her death the suit property was to go to the bhatkar.  In view of the provisions of Art.2207 of the Portuguese Civil Code a person holding usufruct can only create rights in favour of third parties during his lifetime and not beyond that.  Any such rights which are created during the lifetime stand extinguished with the death of usufructor.  Therefore, permission granted by the lady would not create any right in favour of the applicant beyond her death.  For the application of S.4 it is first essential for a person to prove that he is a mundkar within the meaning of Section 2(p) of the Act.  The applicant had failed to establish that he was residing with the consent of bhatkar, or with the consent granted by any person acting or purporting to act on behalf of him.  Unless this basic requirement is established, the applicant could not qualify to be a mundkar of non-applicant.  Till the death of the lady the residence of the applicant was under permission granted by her in her right as usufructor of the suit property and, as such, the applicant could by no stretch of imagination be considered as trespasser within the meaning of Explanation to Section 2(p) of the Act.

It can be granted by the Mamlatdar after making the enquiry as contemplated by Section 6(2).  The learned advocate for the petitioner submitted that it is only possible for the Mamlatdar to grant such a mandatory injunction after holding the necessary enquiry as contemplated by Section 6(2) of the Mundkar Act and she also invited Court's attention to Rules 14(7), 15 and 16 of the Goa, Daman and Diu Mundkars (Protection From Eviction) Rules, 1977.  They prescribe the method of holding enquiry.  Further, Section 6(3) of the Mundkar Act speaks about granting of temporary injunction and this could be granted by the Mamlatdar on the basis of the affidavits or otherwise.  Thus he can also grant a temporary injunction so as to prevent a bhatkar from disturbing mundkar's right.  It is contended that Section 6(3) only speaks about prevention of contravention and not where already the contravention is committed.  It is not possible to accept this contention.  The disturbance of right is continuous and in the present case by putting a wall or blockade, the access of the respondent to the drinking water well is blocked and the said facility of having drinking water is cut off.  It is continuous.  Therefore, there is nothing wrong in granting such interim mandatory injunction.  It is not necessary to wait till completion of enquiry in such cases.\t\t\t [Para 4]"

What the Authority under the Mundkar Act has to do is to merely demarcate the area to which the Mundkar is entitled to under Law. The Authority cannot grant more area than what the Mundkar is legally entitled to as the Act also has fixed the price which is to be paid which is not the market value of the land and as such the Bhatkar cannot be compelled to sell more areas than what the Act provides. Any area beyond what the Mundkar intends to purchase or otherwise will be the subject matter of an agreement between the Mundkar and the owner. Insofar as the Mundkar Act is concerned, the jurisdiction of the Mamlatdar is restricted to deciding the area of the dwelling house in terms of the definition and provisions contained under the Act. Agreement with the parties to purchase more area than what in Law is provided can be an agreement between the parties to which at the highest the Mamlatdar can put his seal; in other words, it is something like a consent decree obtained by parties.  [Para 7]\n\nIf the  persons have obtained more area than they are entitled to and there is demarcation and they have constructed thereon it would be too late in the day to call on such persons who may be occupying more area than what in law they are entitled to under Art. 226. Interest of justice would suffice if the landlord is compensated.  [Para 7]"

As per the 1975 Rules, the educational qualification for promotees to the posts of Market/Municipal Inspector was Intermediate/Senior Cambridge or any other equivalent qualification. Senior Supervisor with five years standing in the grade was qualified to the promotional post. In terms of the 1986 Rules minimum educational qualification required for the posts of Market/Municipal Inspector is S.S.C. Thus, the respondents did not possess minimum educational qualification for promotion to the posts of Market Inspector. There was no power to relax the educational qualification and, as such, the promotion of respondents to the posts of Market Inspector in the year 1983 on ad-hoc basis was contrary to the Recruitment Rules. Taking this factor into consideration they were reverted to their original posts. There was no provision for relaxation of educational qualification either under the 1975 Rules or under the 1986 Rules, but the provision relating to relaxation of educational qualifications was introduced for the first time by the 1994 Amendment which came into force from 20th January 1994. The power under the said Amendment to relax the educational qualification vests in the Director of Municipal Administration. The Director of Municipal Administration had refused to relax the said provisions relating to educational qualification in respect of respondents. The matter having been closed it was again examined by the Minister and order of revocation of revision order was passed by the Minister.\n\nHeld, that the order revoking the reversion orders and directing regularisation of respondents was totally arbitrary, illegal in utter defiance of recruitment rules and abuse of power. His plea that the exercise was done bona fide could not be accepted.  [Para 16]"

As per the 1975 Rules, the educational qualification for promotees to the posts of Market/Municipal Inspector was Intermediate/Senior Cambridge or any other equivalent qualification. Senior Supervisor with five years standing in the grade was qualified to the promotional post. In terms of the 1986 Rules minimum educational qualification required for the posts of Market/Municipal Inspector is S.S.C. Thus, the respondents did not possess minimum educational qualification for promotion to the posts of Market Inspector. There was no power to relax the educational qualification and, as such, the promotion of respondents to the posts of Market Inspector in the year 1983 on ad-hoc basis was contrary to the Recruitment Rules. Taking this factor into consideration they were reverted to their original posts. There was no provision for relaxation of educational qualification either under the 1975 Rules or under the 1986 Rules, but the provision relating to relaxation of educational qualifications was introduced for the first time by the 1994 Amendment which came into force from 20th January 1994. The power under the said Amendment to relax the educational qualification vests in the Director of Municipal Administration. The Director of Municipal Administration had refused to relax the said provisions relating to educational qualification in respect of respondents. The matter having been closed it was again examined by the Minister and order of revocation of revision order was passed by the Minister.\n\nHeld, that the order revoking the reversion orders and directing regularisation of respondents was totally arbitrary, illegal in utter defiance of recruitment rules and abuse of power. His plea that the exercise was done bona fide could not be accepted.  [Para 16]"

The scope and ambit of supervision and control of the Port Authorities under the Ports Act in regard to areas declared as ports, is very wide. As noticed above, section 6(jj) of the Act, in particular, enables the State Government to make rules for regulating the use of landing places, piers, jetties, wharves, quays, warehouses and sheds belonging to the Government and fixing the rates to be paid for the use of the same. [Para 17]\n\nThe 1992 amendment and the 1994 amendment to the Goa, Daman and Diu Ports Rules, 1983 which enable the Port Authorities to levy, charge and recover a fee or charge for using open Government riverine land from the person who is permitted to use such Government riverine land is within the rule-making power of the State, and cannot therefore be said to be ultra vires the rule-making power under the Act. In fact, even without specific rules, the Port Authorities in exercise of domain over riverine land and the river, could object to or prohibit the exclusive mooring by vessels which call at the workshop. The Port Authorities can also enter into an arrangement of lease/licence with the users of such riverine land/demarcated river surface alongside the workshop or establishment. But in the absence of specific rules and in the absence of stipulation of any special condition when granting permission, the persons permitted to have their establishment on private land on the banks of the river (falling within the port area), could well presume that the permission to have their establishment, included implied permission to use the riverine land/river alongside their establishments.

The Rules only provided for a fee for the occupation of open plots. Only by the 1992 amendment, the words 'open riverine land' was added under Entry 21(4)(A-iv) of the First Schedule so as to subject the occupation of open riverine land to payment of fees. Prior to the 1992 amendment, the First Schedule to the Rules did not provide for levy of any fees for occupation of riverine land. However, it was only by the 1994 amendment, with effect from 3.3.1994, the Rules were amended by inserting clause (ff) in Rule 2 containing the definition of 'government riverine land' and by inserting Rule 54-A specifically providing that no government riverine land shall be used, without prior written permission of the Captain of Ports and without making advance payment of rental charges at the prescribed rate. Therefore, prior to the said amendment to the Rules in 1994, neither the Act nor the Rules authorized or enabled the Government to levy any fee/charge for use of government riverine land. The fact that the Port Authorities were demanding a fee for use of riverine land even prior to 1992/1994 or that some workshop owners were paying such amount, did not mean that the demand was lawfully made in pursuance of authority vested in them to make such demand, or that the persons on whom the demands were made, were bound to pay the same.

Subsequently D terminated the said agreement and surrendered the business to F who in turn gave it by agreement to the appellant to run it again on royalty basis, the appellant commenced the business in his own name and style, got registered the establishment as an independent dealer under the Sales Tax Act and started paying sales tax on goods sold by him. He had no connection with the business of D. He was only a bonafide purchaser for price of the goods which belonged to D.

This contention is not tenable for various reasons. Admittedly, the appellant started the school as a middle school and the Vth standard was started in the year 1994-95. VIth standard was started in 1995-96 and the permission to open the VIIth standard was given during the year 1996-97. The present request is to start VIIIth standard in that school which would convert the school to a secondary school. Even though the request of the appellant is to have a new class in the existing school but the real demand of the appellant is to have a secondary school as the existing school is only up to VIIth standard and if the school is to become a secondary school, norms laid down under Rule 31 are to be necessarily followed. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that starting of a new class does not amount to a new school cannot be accepted for the reason that rigorous criteria prescribed under Rule 31 are to be followed for starting a new school. For opening a new class in the existing school, the appellant-society need only satisfy the authorities that there are certain physical facilities available with the school and that there are sufficient students for starting a class. Whereas under Rule 31, the authorities have to take into consideration various other aspects and find out whether the opening of a new school is necessary to meet the educational needs of that area.  [Para 8]\n\nUnder Rule 2(1)(f), middle stage of the school is specifically mentioned as the stage of school education from Class Vth to VIIth (both inclusive). As regards 'Secondary Stage', an inclusive definition is given so as to take in standards Vth to VIIth also, within the secondary stage and that would only indicate that even if a school is having a middle stage consisting of classes IVth to VIIth still it would be deemed as secondary stage if there are classes from Vth to Xth. As regards the appellant's school is concerned, there are classes only from Vth to VIIth, it does not fall within any other category and it has to be held as a middle school. If it is converted into a secondary school by addition of standard VIIIth, we are of the view that the guidelines under R. 31 of the 'Rules' are to be followed as it amounts starting of new school having Secondary stage.

It is a step to be resorted in public interest and not to vindicate individual interests.  Before an action under S.20 can be justified not only one or the other of the seven grounds appearing in S.20(1) to be made good, but also it has to be found that the action of taking over the management is expedient in public interest or in the interest of the school education or in order to secure the proper management of the school.  It is only when both these ingredients are held to have been satisfied that an action of taking over management under S.20 can be justified.  [Para 6,7]\n\nHeld, on facts, that the action which was purported to have been taken under the provisions of S.20 of the Act was not only not bonafide, but was virtually undertaken as a matter of witch hunting.  The case did not fall under any of the clauses found in S.20(1) of the Act.  The impugned order of taking over the management therefore deserves to be quashed and set aside.  [Para 24]"

That Rule specifically says that the promotion should be made on the basis of the seniority if the incumbent possesses the requisite qualifications required for that post.  It also provides that management shall select the best qualified and most competent person from among those available for selection/appointment to the post.  [Para 4]\n\nRule 34 is a Rule enacted to meet a particular contingency of a Teacher being thrown out and become jobless on a fine morning without any fault of that Teacher.  A protection by the Rules is given to such Teachers from saving that Teacher from being thrown out of employment.  However, it is not the intention of the rule-making authority that by operating this Rule a statutory right of promotion to another teacher is to be jeopardized.  Right of being considered for promotion is a fundamental right of a Government employee, but this right is being extended to a private school which is run by the Government funds.  Rule 86 gives a paramount right to a teacher for promotion.  This right cannot be subjected to any fetters.  [Para 5]\n\nThe petitioner in instant case is having B.Com., B.Ed., qualifications with the subjects of English and History.  She was appointed as an Assistant Teacher in the school as an Under-graduate Teacher.  Another teacher was a Science Trained (Graduate) Teacher.  She was appointed on part-time basis as Under-graduate Teacher.  Her subjects were Maths and Science.  When a regular vacancy of Science (Trained) Teacher arose.  She being qualified for that post, was appointed in that post.  However, because of fall in number of divisions in the school, she had to be retrenched.  Again when an Under-graduate (Arts) Category Teacher resigned, she was accommodated in that vacancy, though she is Science Graduate.\n\nIn the facts of the case held that when a vacancy arose on retirement of a teacher belonging to the Arts (Graduate) Category, the petitioner being fully qualified to hold the post was eligible to be promoted to that vacancy.  Another teacher who was absorbed under S.34 could not be promoted to that vacancy.  When a conflict arises between Rule 86 and Rule 34, certainly claim under Rule 86 should prevail.  [Para 5]"

In case no post of U.D.C. is available in any other School, the petitioner will be entitled to be absorbed in the School in which he is working and in such eventuality also pay scale of Head Clerk and pay and allowances last drawn by him in the said scale are to be protected.  [Para 12]\n\nInsofar as the absorption of a surplus employee who is Head Clerk, against another vacancy of Head Clerk in another School is concerned, in view of the second proviso to Rule 34(1) of the Rules, the absorbed employee shall have to be treated a s juniormost person in the said category of Head Clerk.

Accordingly, after reversion of the petitioner to the post of U.D.C. in the same school, he would be on the top of the seniority list of U.D.Cs. There is no reason as to why this principle should not be followed in case of absorption of an employee to a post lower than the one which he was holding. Ofcourse, if the surplus employee who was working as Head Clerk is to be absorbed in any other school in the category of Head Clerk, such Head Clerk shall have to rank as juniormost in the said category of Head Clerks in the other school in the absence of any challenge to the second proviso to Rule 34(1) of the said Rules. The petitioner who was holding the post of Head Clerk would rank as seniormost if absorbed against the post of U.D.C. irrespective of whether he is absorbed in the same school or other school, and will have to be placed on top of the seniority list because otherwise it will result in grave injustice to the petitioner.

In case no post of U.D.C. is available in any other School, the petitioner will be entitled to be absorbed in the School in which he is working and in such eventuality also pay scale of Head Clerk and pay and allowances last drawn by him in the said scale are to be protected.  [Para 12]\n\nInsofar as the absorption of a surplus employee who is Head Clerk, against another vacancy of Head Clerk in another School is concerned, in view of the second proviso to Rule 34(1) of the Rules, the absorbed employee shall have to be treated a s juniormost person in the said category of Head Clerk. However, the same Rule cannot be applied if a surplus Head Clerk is appointed to the post of U.D.C. or, for that matter, against the post of L.D.C. in case no vacancy of U.D.C. is available in any School. On re-deployment against the said post of U.D.C. and L.D.C. which are admittedly lower posts than the post held by the petitioner, his seniority against the said absorbed post cannot be brought down as lowest in the category of U.D.C. or L.D.C. Even in case of reversion of an employee from higher post to lower post, after reversion the employee would rank as seniormost in the category where he is reverted. Accordingly, after reversion of the petitioner to the post of U.D.C. in the same school, he would be on the top of the seniority list of U.D.Cs. There is no reason as to why this principle should not be followed in case of absorption of an employee to a post lower than the one which he was holding. Ofcourse, if the surplus employee who was working as Head Clerk is to be absorbed in any other school in the category of Head Clerk, such Head Clerk shall have to rank as juniormost in the said category of Head Clerks in the other school in the absence of any challenge to the second proviso to Rule 34(1) of the said Rules. The petitioner who was holding the post of Head Clerk would rank as seniormost if absorbed against the post of U.D.C. irrespective of whether he is absorbed in the same school or other school, and will have to be placed on top of the seniority list because otherwise it will result in grave injustice to the petitioner.

This contention is not tenable for various reasons. Admittedly, the appellant started the school as a middle school and the Vth standard was started in the year 1994-95. VIth standard was started in 1995-96 and the permission to open the VIIth standard was given during the year 1996-97. The present request is to start VIIIth standard in that school which would convert the school to a secondary school. Even though the request of the appellant is to have a new class in the existing school but the real demand of the appellant is to have a secondary school as the existing school is only up to VIIth standard and if the school is to become a secondary school, norms laid down under Rule 31 are to be necessarily followed. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that starting of a new class does not amount to a new school cannot be accepted for the reason that rigorous criteria prescribed under Rule 31 are to be followed for starting a new school. For opening a new class in the existing school, the appellant-society need only satisfy the authorities that there are certain physical facilities available with the school and that there are sufficient students for starting a class. Whereas under Rule 31, the authorities have to take into consideration various other aspects and find out whether the opening of a new school is necessary to meet the educational needs of that area.  [Para 8]\n\nUnder Rule 2(1)(f), middle stage of the school is specifically mentioned as the stage of school education from Class Vth to VIIth (both inclusive). As regards 'Secondary Stage', an inclusive definition is given so as to take in standards Vth to VIIth also, within the secondary stage and that would only indicate that even if a school is having a middle stage consisting of classes IVth to VIIth still it would be deemed as secondary stage if there are classes from Vth to Xth. As regards the appellant's school is concerned, there are classes only from Vth to VIIth, it does not fall within any other category and it has to be held as a middle school. If it is converted into a secondary school by addition of standard VIIIth, we are of the view that the guidelines under R. 31 of the 'Rules' are to be followed as it amounts starting of new school having Secondary stage.

It is only when there are tangible reasons to by-pass the claim of such person, any person junior to him can be selected. The Rule does not give equal importance to seniority and merit.\n\nWhen the seniority has been made the principal consideration by the Rules, it would only be permissible to by-pass the claim of the senior most person if there is something negative which would disentitle him from being what is due according to his seniority. This negative has to be something to do with the job for which he is being considered. Therefore, in no uncertain terms, the Rule prescribes that such a reason which plays negative role in denying just promotion to a senior most teacher will have to be recorded in the minutes of the Departmental Promotion Committee. This is to ensure that arbitrarily any claim of a senior most person is not by-passed. The use of the expression \"tangible reasons\" also indicates that the reasons must have some relevance with the purpose to be achieved.  [Para 4]"

[Para 20]\n\nThe landlord gave notice to one of the heirs of the deceased tenant terminating tenancy on ground of arrears of rent and bona fide requirement.  The premises were initially given on rent to the deceased father of the noticee.  In his reply to the notice he admitted the same and also claimed that on his father's death, he became the tenant of the premises.  He did not suggest in his reply that the other heirs of the deceased father were also tenants of the suit premises.  Accordingly, the landlord filed this suit against the tenant alone and it is only in the Written Statement that the tenant took the plea of non-joinder of other legal heirs who were also the tenants of the suit premises.  In fact, he would be estopped from taking such plea in view of the stand taken by him in reply to the notice wherein he contended that he was the tenant of the suit premises and the plea in the Written Statement has been taken to defeat the suit.  In the meantime, Rent Act was made applicable to the area in which the suit premises are existing and, therefore, the landlord joined the other legal heirs.  From the notice and reply it appears that the tenant alone was conducting business in the suit premises.  The notice on him will have to be treated as notice to all the other legal heirs as well.  Moreover, it is the case of the landlord that the rent of the suit premises was being paid by the tenant.  In reply to notice also the tenant contended that he was the tenant.  From all these circumstances, it appears that he was acting on behalf of all the other legal heirs, who were joint tenants.  The notice for eviction which was issued by the appellant was in respect of eviction of the entire suit premises and not a part of it.  In the circumstances the notice served upon him was sufficient compliance of law.  [Para 21,22]"

(1908), O.1 R.10. \nLimitation Act (1963), S.21.\n\nA suit for eviction of tenant was filed prior to application of Rent Act to the locality wherein suit premises were situated.  Notice terminating tenancy was given to only one heir of the original deceased tenant.  No notice was required to be given before institution of the suit under Decree No.43525 on ground of non-payment of rent, though, under the Rent Act, such notice is required.  It was only after the heir raised plea in his written statement that he along with other heirs were joint tenants, that they were impleaded in the suit.  In view of S.59(2) of the Rent Act no rights can be acquired by the other heirs during the pendency of the suit which was saved from the applicability of the Rent Act vis-a-vis the subject-matter of the suit.  Therefore, the eviction proceedings which had been instituted for termination of tenancy of the suit premises as a whole would be saved under Section 59 of the Rent Act, not only vis-a-vis the heir against whom the suit was instituted initially, but also against the other heirs who were joined as necessary parties to the suit at a later stage.  The Civil Court had taken cognizance of the subject-matter as a whole and non-joinder of necessary parties was a mere irregularity, which was subsequently cured by bringing the legal heirs on record.  Accordingly, the jurisdiction of the Civil Court to deal with the matter against the other heirs shall not be affected in view of Section 56 of Rent Act.  In the circumstances of the case, the effect of Order 1, Rule 10(5) C.P.C. and Section 21 of the Limitation Act would be only for the purpose of determination of the question as to whether the proceedings as on the date when the new plaintiff or defendant is added, are barred by limitation and if such proceedings are barred by limitation as on the said date, the proceedings are bound to fail.  There is no limitation period prescribed either under Decree No.43525 or under the Rent Act to file a suit for eviction.  Therefore, the joinder of the other heirs at a later stage does not, in any manner, affect the proceedings.  The proceedings as against the other heirs are not bad on account of lack of jurisdiction in view of Section 56 of the Rent Act.  [Para 23,24]"

The enactments sought to levy duty, not on consumers but upon the seller selling electricity in pursuance of inter-State contracts of sale. These observations therefore, cannot be torn out of context or applied to the challenges to the said Act, which, as pointed out earlier, impose no duty either upon the seller or upon sales, much less, inter-State sales of electricity.\t(Para 34)\n\tWe are satisfied that the case of the petitioners cannot be said to be covered by the decision of the Constitution Bench in NTPCL (2002) 5 SCC 203.

The said Act levies a duty only upon consumption of electricity by the consumers in the State of Goa and consequently, such a legislation, is entirely relatable to Entry 53 of List II of the VIIth Schedule to the Constitution of India and consequently intra vires legislative competence of the State Legislatures. \n(2002) 5 SCC 203 Disting.\n2017 (1) Karnataka Law Journal 7, 2011 (5) Karnataka Law Journal 296 Ref.to.\t\t\t\t(Para 37)"

Admittedly, the tenant by his first application dated 7-7-93 sought an amendment to the written statement, on the ground that it would be in the interest of justice to allow the tenant to take the plea of permanent tenancy.  However the tenant in subsequent application dated 14-6-04 did not assign any reason as to why the tenant was withdrawing the plea of permanent tenancy taken by him earlier.\n\nThe tenant by taking up the plea of permanent tenancy gave a new or additional ground to the landlords for the eviction of the tenant, in case the said plea of permanent tenancy was proved not to be bonafide.  Both the parties have been agitating over the said plea for over ten years.  It would hardly matter if the said period of ten years lapsed on account of the fault of either of the parties or for that matter on account of the fault of the learned Rent Controller in adjourning the proceedings for one reason or the other.

Therefore, the exercise of power under Section 14 for grant of land for setting up SEZs will depend on the factual situation such as the purpose for which it is going to be used by the SEZ. If the land is to be allotted or transferred to SEZ predominantly for promoting or establishing or developing industries, then the power to allot can be lawfully exercised.  In this case, the allotment of lands to the companies has been made in undue haste without proper scrutiny of their applications. The allotment of lands has been made arbitrarily. Procedure adopted in the allotment is not fair and transparent. The allotments made by the GIDC do not stand the test of reasonableness. \t\t\t\t\t [Para 84,101]\n\nIt is true that the allotment of public property need not be made by holding a public auction as a matter of rule. However, the State or public authorities cannot act like private persons while disposing of the public properties. A public authority can allot lands only to deserving and eligible persons after satisfying itself about the credibility and capacity of the person. The procedure adopted while allotting public properties must be fair and transparent and the action has to be in the public interest. Before the concerned authority comes to the conclusion and records subjective satisfaction that the proposed allotment is in public interest, at least some kind of scrutiny of the credentials of the applicants is mandatory. In these cases allotment of large lands having area of more than 30,00,000 square meters was made to few companies within a span of few days or a few weeks. Moreover, the action of allotment shows lack of application of mind. Such huge lands which are public properties were allotted for the asking to the said companies in a manner not known to Law. The action of allotment of lands is illegal being arbitrary and unreasonable.\t\t\t\t\t\t  [Para 91]\n\nEven assuming that on the date when applications were made by the said companies, there were no applications made by any third parties for the allotment of the said lands, there was no reason to make allotments in a great deal of haste and without any scrutiny of the applications. Even assuming that the GIDC could have done it without inviting offers from competitors, surely the GIDC without satisfying itself that the allotment was being made to deserving companies having good experience in the field with a view to promote orderly establishment, growth and development of industries in the State of Goa, could not have allotted such vast lands. For recording such satisfaction, a scrutiny of financial status and capacity of the companies was mandatory especially when two of the companies were under formation. In the circumstances, a finding will have to be recorded that the allotment of lands to the said Companies was not legal.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 92]"

The notice under Section 80 is required when the suit is filed in respect of any act purporting to be done by the public officer in his official capacity. The expression \"act purporting to be done\" is important and it would take within its fold even those acts which may not be actually part of the powers or duties of the public Officer, but are so intimately connected with the duties of the public officer as cannot be separated from them. This is not so, in case of Section 52A of the GID Act. There is no use of the expression \"purporting to be done\" therein and what is used is expression \"in pursuance or execution or intending execution of this Act\", which expression appears to be narrower in connotation from the former expression used in Section 80. In the latter expression, the act complained of must be such as is performed in execution of the powers, functions and duties under the GID Act or in accordance with the provisions of the GID Act or should be in respect of alleged neglect or default in putting into effect the execution of the Act. Thus, the act complained of should have direct nexus with the powers, functions and duties under the Act. This may not be so in case of the act contemplated under Section 80 CPC and it would be enough if the act, though not strictly within the four corners of the officials capacity, has been done in the course of discharge of official functions. That apart, there is no provision under Section 52 A similar to sub-section (2) of Section 80, conferring power upon the Court to grant leave to file a suit without serving of any notice as required under sub-section (1) of Section 80. Once we find that Section 80 CPC and Section 52A GID Act bear no similarity with each other, there can be no question of applying the principle of deemed waiver of the notice required under Section 52 A of the GID Act. It would be incorrect to say that once the authority contests the suit on merits, it could not complain later on of non-service of notice. Authority cannot be deemed to have waived notice under Section 52 A. Requirement of Section 52 A, one need not say are mandatory, which is clear from its language. The Section places an embargo upon institution of the suit until the expiration of the period of two months next after notice in writing has been given to the corporation. The Section begins with the words \"No suit shall lie against the corporation or against committee.......\" and use of the word \"shall\" is sufficiently indicative of imperative nature of this Section. The Section also admits of no exceptional situation as it does not contain provision, unlike the one under sub-section (2) of Section 80 C.P.C., for dispensing with the notice.     [Para 13,14,15]"

The entire proceedings having been proceeded on the presumption that there has been change in user of the land without there being any material in support thereto, it is apparent that the authorities have acted arbitrarily and in improper exercise of their jurisdiction while imposing the penalty of demolition of structure constructed by the Petitioner in the said area.  The orders cannot be sustained.  [Para 2]"

To see that he does not easily defeat the said bar by transferring the property, a prohibition was attached to the land itself by providing that no land which vested in a tenant under the Tenancy Act shall be used or allowed to be used for any purpose other than agriculture. But for the exemption contained in section 3, when such a property is acquired under the Land Acquisition Act for public purpose, the prohibition under section 2 in regard to use of the land for any purpose other than agriculture would have continued to apply. Therefore it was necessary to make an exemption in regard to the lands acquired for public purpose. That is, even though a land which vested in a tenant under the Tenancy Act was subject to a covenant that it could not be used for any agricultural purpose in future, once it was acquired under the Land Acquisition Act for a public purpose and vested in the government, the prohibition contained under section 2 would cease to operate, and the state government or the beneficiary of acquisition could use it for any purpose. Section 3 is therefore a provision which entitles the State Government or beneficiary of acquisition to use it for any purpose other than agriculture. The said section will not enable the landowner to get the market value of the land as one with nonagricultural potential. In so far as the landowner is concerned, the compensation to which he is entitled would be what he would have got if he had sold it in open market to a willing purchaser who could have used it only for agricultural purpose. \t\t   [Para 22]"

The characteristic of a freehold tenure is that there is inheritability and transferability as a matter of right. In case of a land held by a Communidade, there is no defect in the title or ownership of the Communidade, but the restriction is on transferring the land held by the Communidade by way of sale, lease or exchange. Restriction is that such a transfer by way of sale cannot be made without prior sanction. There is no complete prohibition against effecting such transfer. In case of an insolvency of Communidade, there is a power to sell land of Communidade. However, there is a general power vesting in a Communidade by virtue of Article 30 of the Code to transfer its land by sale, lease or exchange with the sanction.\n\nWhile assessing the market value for the purpose of Section 23 of the said Act of 1894 by comparison method, the test adopted is what a prudent and genuine buyer will offer as a price of the acquired land. In case of a land, which is not freehold in the sense that a transfer thereof cannot be effected without sanction of the authorities, a willing bona fide buyer may not offer the same price, which he may offer in respect of a comparable freehold land as the buyer will be conscious of the fact that there are restrictions on transferability or that the authority empowered to sanction sale may impose some conditions. Therefore, he may offer to some extent a lesser price to the land having such restrictions. However, it cannot be said that the sale instance of a freehold land which is otherwise comparable to the acquired land cannot afford a basis to determine the market value of a land, which is having restrictions on transfer.\n\nIn case of a land held by a Communidade, the restriction on transfer will be one of the negative factors, which will have to be considered while fixing the market value. Taking into consideration the said negative factor, some deduction will have to be made depending upon the facts of a particular case while fixing the market value on the basis of a comparable sale instance of a free-hold land.

Not only that, the Order dated 7-7-1989 issued by the Under Secretary, Legislature did not even have the imprimatur of the State Government as required under the Rules and one fails to understand as to how without a formal approval of the Government and without changing the relevant recruitment which provided for a different scale Rules which a new pay scale from Rs.1400-2300 to Rs.1640-2900 came to be sanctioned in the case of the translators of the Legislature Secretariat.  In these petitions there is no question of attacking the Order of the Special Board by the Secretary (Legislature).  In fact, the Secretary (Legislature) who has filed the affidavit opposing the petition was duty bound to place the correct legal position, not only before the State Government but also before the Court as he has rightly done, namely that the translators of the Legislature Secretariat could not have been granted the said scale of Rs.1640-2900 when their counterparts in the State Secretariat were drawing a scale of Rs.1400-2300.  As far as the petitioner Yuvraj Naik is concerned, it is a clear case of he having been granted a revised scale of Rs.1640-2900 when he was not entitled to the same and having been so granted after 1-1-1986 the same had to be ignored in terms of Government Order dated 27-10-1997.  As far as the petitioner Smt. Blandina D'Sa is concerned, she could not have been appointed on a scale which is wrongly revised.

Art.2 of Portuguese Colonial Mining Law (20.09.1906) makes it clear that rights in minor minerals vest solely in State Govt. - Said legal position is even fortified by S.24-A of Mines and Minerals Act, 1957 - Right of land owner is limited to have compensation - Challenge to the 2002 Amendment is without any substance - Liable to be dismissed. \n\nSub-section (2) of Section 14 of Land Revenue Code clearly provides that unless it is otherwise expressly provided in any law for the time being in force or in terms of a grant made by the Government, the right to mines, minerals and mineral products shall vest in the Government and it shall have all the powers necessary for the proper enjoyment of such rights.\n\nSection 36 of the Land Revenue Code makes it clear that unless it is otherwise expressly provided by the terms of the grant made by the Government, the right to all minerals at whatever place found, whether on the surface or underground, including all derelict or working mines and quarries, old dumps, pits, fields, bandhas, nallas, creeks, river-beds and such other places, is and is hereby declared to be expressly reserved and shall vest in the Government which shall have all powers necessary for the proper enjoyment of such right.      [Para 12,13]\n\nIn view of sub-section (2) of Section 14 and Section 36 of the Land Revenue Code, right to minerals at wherever place found, has been expressly reserved and shall vest in the Government which shall have all powers necessary for the purpose of enjoyment of such right. It can thus be seen that in view of specific statutory provision which has reserved right in mines and minerals at all places in the State and also providing that the said mines and minerals shall vest in the State, the petitioner cannot claim to have right over the mines and minerals. The rights would be restricted only to surface soil.  [Para 27]\n\nIt would also be relevant to refer to Article 2 of Decree dated 20.09.1906 which was a Portuguese Colonial Mining Law in force during the erstwhile regime A perusal of Article 2 of the aforesaid decree would reveal that all metals and metal-liferous minerals belong to the State and such beds cannot be prospected or worked without licence and concession by the Government.  [Para 14]\n\nIn view of the provisions of sub-section (2) of Section 14 and Section 36 of the Land Revenue Code, read with the provisions of Article 2 of Decree dated 20.09.1906 which was a Portuguese Colonial Mining Law, the right in the minor minerals vests solely in the State Government and the State Government has all powers necessary for the purpose of enjoyment of such rights. This position is fortified by the provisions of Section 24A of the Mines and Minerals Act, which is applicable to all minerals, including minor minerals.\n\nIn view of the provisions of Section 24A of the said Act, a holder of a prospecting licence etc., is empowered to enter the lands over which such permit, etc. has been granted, at all times during its currency and carry out all such operations. The limited right in view of sub-section (2) of Section 24A of the said Act and sub-section (4) of Section 36 of the Land Revenue Code, is that the land owner will have right of compensation for such infringement.\n\nIn that view of the matter, the petition is without any substance and deserves to be dismissed.

Thereafter in another meeting resolution was adopted and stated that proposal to reject complaint was made by another member and it was wrongly recorded that proposal was made by respondent no.1.

                "description": "Appeal or Writ Petition - Can be filed only by an aggrieved person when it is otherwise not filed in public interest. \n\nSection 66 of the Goa Panchayat Raj Act provides for grant of permission by the Village Panchayat and to take action against constructions or reconstructions done without its permission. It is the primary duty of the Village Panchayat as an elected body to grant permissions and to take actions for demolitions in cases of buildings which are erected, added or reconstructed without such permissions. In case the Panchayat fails to grant permission when applied for, then the applicant is entitled to approach the Deputy Director in an appeal and obtain such a permission. It may be that the Village Panchayat is an elected body while the Deputy Director or the Director are government servants, but the fact remains that the Act provides a hierarchy of authorities for the grant of permission for the construction of buildings and/or demolition of illegal constructions carried out without permission or contrary to the rules. Again, it may be noted that the Panchayat may be elected body, but when it fails to decide an application for permission or take action for demolition in terms of Sub-sections (3) and (4), its powers are exercised or can be taken over by the Deputy Director who is entitled to take such steps as may be necessary for grant of licence or the demolition of the buildings. That one authority is elected and the others are not is of no consequence. That a Village Panchayat is heard by the Deputy Director or the Director before passing orders in appeals is only for the purpose of defending its action and for compliance of principles of natural justice but such a procedural formality cannot be construed as conferring a right of appeal on the Village Panchayat to challenge the orders of the Deputy Director or of the Director. There cannot be an appeal unless it is specifically provided for by the statute. In other words, Section 66 of the Act operates and regulates a mechanism of granting permission/s for the construction of building/s and demolition thereof, in case they are constructed without permission or contrary to the rules or conditions imposed by the permissions which are granted.\n\nThese Writ Petitions certainly are not filed in public interest against the orders of the Additional Director of Panchayats. They could be filed only if some rights of the petitioners are affected. Petitioners cannot be said to be aggrieved by the decisions of the Additional Director of Panchayats who in the scheme of Section 66 of the Act has been conferred an authority to hear appeals from the decisions of the Village Panchayat. An appeal or a Writ Petition can be filed only by an aggrieved person when it is otherwise not filed in public interest. The expression \"Aggrieved\" has been defined by Black's Law Dictionary as having suffered loss or injury; damnified; injured. An \"Aggrieved party\" has been defined in the same dictionary as one whose legal right is invaded by an act complained of, or whose pecuniary interest is directly and adversely affected by a decree or judgment. One whose right of property may be established or divested. The word \"aggrieved\" refers to a substantial grievance, a denial of some personal, pecuniary or property right, or the imposition upon a party of a burden or obligation.\n\n1995 (1) SCC 203; 2002 (1) SCC 33 - Ref . to.

It is clear that the Respondent was present during the entire meeting and he participated in the proceedings. It was respondent case that he left the meeting hall when the question of grant of NOC to his wife was being discussed. Thus, his stand is that he did not take any part in the discussion. Accepting such an argument would be ignoring the overwhelming evidence on record and allowing Respondent to change his stand frequently. The cross-examination of the Secretary of the Village Panchayat by Respondent no.1 reveals that in answer to a specific question on this point, the Secretary replied that all the members present participated in the said discussion. Thus, it is too late in the day to argue now that the Respondent does not incur any disqualification.\n\nThe version of the Respondent in his affidavit in evidence is that he had not participated in the discussion in the meeting held on 28.12.2007\n\nIt is argued that a provision for disqualification should be strictly construed as it is penal in nature, but the Hon'ble Supreme Court held that even such a provision can be interpreted consistent with the object and purpose for which the same is enacted.\n\nUndue emphasis on the distinction as may frustrate and defeat the object sought to be achieved.\n\nOnce there is evidence to indicate that there is participation in the discussion when the question was taken up, then, to what extent and what degree the participation is, cannot be of much relevance.

Section 201-A permits appeal in miscellaneous matters within period of 30 days from the date of refusal of any request by said authority. The explanation defines refusal as rejection of any request in writing or non-conveying of any reply to the application within a period of 15 days from the receipt of application in its office by Panchayat. Section 66 of sub-Section (2) permits filing of appeal within 30 days after the date of expiry of period of 30 days of filing application for grant of permission if no decision is taken thereon by the Village Panchayat with said period. Thus, provisions of Section 66(2) prescribe different period for accrual of 'cause' and rule out applicability of explanation of Section 201-A. It is therefore obvious that Section 201-A read with explanation is not available in the matter regulated by Section 66. In view of this finding, it is apparent that reliance upon it by Panchayat to point out the alternate remedy to the petitioners is misconceived. Words in Section 201-A like \"dealt with\" or \"request in writing\" or new obligation to decide within 15 days contemplated therein, all show that said Section envisages that Panchayat is acting within four corners of Panchayat Raj Act and Rules. It is not attracted when Panchayat undertakes some activity without any authority of law and jurisdiction. In any case, such alternate remedy need not bar petitioners from directly approaching High Court. In the circumstances, the impugned action of Village Panchayat of issuing a show cause notice and of revoking construction licence of petitioner is found to be without jurisdiction. Hence, the order dated 2.1.2009 impugned in the present petition is accordingly quashed and set aside.  [Para 9,10,11]"

In case, an order or resolution of the panchayat is not suspended, there is no question of the Government taking any further action even if the Government is informed of the dismissal of the application.  1995(1) GLT 302 - Ref. to. \t [Para 23,24,26]"

The SEC, no doubt, has plenary and consequently, even the residual powers when it comes to preparation of electoral rolls for or conduct of all elections to the Panchayats or Zilla Panchayats. However, since the subjects of delimitation of constituencies or providing reservations thereat, cannot be said to be included in the domain of either preparation of the electoral rolls, or conduct of elections, we cannot say that the impugned provisions are unconstitutional on the ground that they usurp the jurisdiction essentially vested in the SEC and confer the same on the Government.\n\n\tIt is true that the Central Government in the Model Panchayat and Gram Swaraj Act which it has formulated and circulated for implementation of 73rd Amendment to the Constitution in letter and spirit also vests powers of providing reservations in the State Election Commission, instead of the State Government. However, based upon this, High Court declined to strike down the impugned provisions.\t(Paras 44, 45, 47, 108)\n\n \tThe absence of rotation policy, or guidelines at the present stage, is not a ground to strike down the impugned provisions, particularly because this is not a matter where the legislature has provided for no guidelines or no norms whatsoever. The real difficulty is in the matter of implementation of these norms or guidelines in their letter and spirit. Therefore, merely because on some occasions, the administrative action in pursuance of the statutory provisions may be arbitrary, that by itself is not a ground to strike down the statutory provisions itself, particularly because the statutory provisions contain sufficient guidelines or norms, which, if adhered to, will rule out arbitrariness to a great extent. The High Court accepted the statement of Advocate General that the Government will, within a period of three months, formulate and publish the norms or guidelines for effective implementation of the rotation policy, envisaged in Article 243 D of the Constitution and Section 7 of the said Act.\t\t\t(Paras 70, 71)"

In other words, as to remissness, its length determines its gravity to be an actionable wrong, but other instances of active misfeasance do not depend on duration. So, misconduct, misuse, or abuse need not be persistent. It is on the contrary. It is illogical to think the Legislation insisted on repeated wrongdoing to apply the disqualification. Suppose a public representative indulgence in corrupt practice, it is preposterous to expect the Legislature to punish only his repeated acts of corruption- not a singular instance.

The notification dated 23rd June, 1993 issued in the public interest withdraws from the operation of the Goa Town Planning Act, the whole of the planning areas declared under the various Notifications, including the area in which the said land is situated. As the very application of the Goa Town Planning Act has been withdrawn, the development plan prepared under that Act, in respect of the area in which the said land is situated, no longer survives.  Therefore, the grievance of the petitioner that the buildings which are being constructed in the said land after 23rd June, 1993 contrary to the development plan, does not survive. The petition is, therefore, liable to be dismissed on this short ground alone. The petitioner submitted that after the withdrawal of the area in which the said land is situated from the operation of the Goa Town Planning Act, the Government of Goa has subsequently issued another notification again making the Goa Town Planning Act applicable to the said area. The petitioner made an oral request for permission to amend the petition to bring on record the subsequent notification, court has declined the oral request, because, subsequent application of the Act to the area would not revive the old development plan. The initial development plan which was made applicable by the Notification dated 11th January, 1990 lapsed by issuance of notification under sub-Section (1) of Section 19 of the Goa Town Planning Act withdrawing the said area from the operation of the Act on 23rd June, 1993. On issuance of a fresh notification making the Goa Town Planning Act applicable, the planning authority would be required to prepare a fresh plan in accordance with the Act. The development plan which lapsed on 23-6-1993 would not ipso facto revive on the Act being made applicable again by a fresh notification.\t\t\t [Para 3,4]"

Knowing fully well that the term is of 5 years stipulated in the appointment order itself, the petitioner has chosen to accept the appointment and only at the fag-end of the term has, in the first place, requested for a renewal and thereafter filed the present petition, calling in question the vires of Section 23(2) of the University Act. The Counsel for the respondent University is justified in contending that the petitioner is blowing hot and cold at the same time and cannot be permitted to approbate and reprobate. The petitioner has taken advantage of the benefit provided by the appointment order and after availing of the benefit in full, he is questioning the authority of the respondents in issuing the said order. The principle of approbation and reprobation is based on the doctrine of election, which postulates that no party can accept and reject the same instrument and that \"a person cannot say at one time that a transaction is valid and thereby obtain some advantage, to which he could only be entitled on the footing that it is valid, and then turn round and say it is void for the purpose of securing some other advantage\". The petitioner cannot be permitted to question the so called termination which is consequent upon the expiry of the term for which the petitioner was appointed. In this regard, the Counsel for the petitioner has submitted that there cannot be an estoppel against the statute. Though the proposition of law is correct, its application to the fact situation is wholly misplaced. In the facts of the present case, the petitioner cannot be permitted to question the action of the respondents in discontinuing the services of the petitioner on expiry of the term for which he was appointed and which he had accepted.

The legislature has now to make so many laws that it has no time to devote to all the details and sometimes the subject on which it has to legislate is of such a technical nature that all it can do is to state the broad principles and leave the details to be worked out by those who are more familiar with the subject.\n\n(b)\tIt is enough if legislature declares its policy laying down the principles and it is enough if an intelligent guidance is given to the subordinate authority. The Court can only interfere if no policy is discernible at all or the delegation is of such an indefinite character as to amount to abdication, but as the discretion vests with the legislature in determining whether there is necessity for delegation or not, the exercise of such discretion is not to be disturbed by the Court, except in clear cases of abuse.\n\n(c)\tThe legislature, as a part of its legislative functions, can confer power to make rules and regulations for carrying the enactment into operation and effect, after the legislature lays down the policy and the principles. Thus, it can delegate the authority to frame subordinate legislations. When the legislative policy and guidance are contained in the Act, the delegating provision would save it from vice of excessive delegation. Essentially legislative functions are those which cannot be delegated. However, other ancillary and incidental matters could be left to the subordinate authority to fill in details with a view to carry out the policy. If guidance is provided by the legislature to the delegated authority, the delegation is valid. Once policy principles or standards for guidance are provided in the Act, then, conferring of power on a subordinate authority to make subordinate or ancillary legislation would be valid. 1989 Supp (1) SCC 430 - Ref. to.

Even though respondent-MMRDA being a local authority, may be a \"State\" u/Art.12 of the Constitution of India, it cannot be equated with Government of Maharashtra either under the Constitution or within the meaning of Government Grants Act, 1985.  It entered into a contract with petitioners as owner of the land as a body corporate, independent of Government of Maharashtra.  Therefore, when the respondent-MMRDA entered into an agreement with petitioner to lease out the land, it did not grant the land to petitioner far or on behalf of Government.  Therefore, it must be held that under the said agreement for lease, the land was not granted to petitioner by or on behalf of Government within the meaning of S.2 of Government Grants Act.  That being so the terms of said agreement cannot be immune from the applicability of statutory provisions contrary to the terms of contract.  [Para 9,10]"

Sub-section(2) of Section 45ZA of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 is also similar to Sub-section (2) of Section 109B. The same is the case with Byelaw 9.11 of the Depositories Act,1996. Even assuming that the format of the nomination requires attestation as required by a will under the Indian Succession Act,1925, the nomination does not become a testamentary disposition. \n\n\tThe provisions relating to nominations under the various Enactments have been consistently interpreted by the Apex Court by holding that the nominee does not get absolute title to the property subject matter of the nomination. The reason is by its very nature, when a share holder or a deposit holder or an insurance policy holder or a member of a Cooperative Society makes a nomination during his life time, he does not transfer his interest in favour of the nominee. It is always held that the nomination does not override the law in relation to testamentary or intestate succession. The provisions regarding nomination are made with a view to ensure that the estate or the rights of the deceased subject matter of the nomination are protected till the legal representatives of the deceased take appropriate steps. None of the provisions of the aforesaid Statutes providing for nominations deal with the succession, testamentary or nontestamentary.\n\n\tThe object of the provisions of the Companies Act is not to either provide a mode of succession or to deal with succession. The object of the Section 109A is to ensure that the deceased shareholder is represented by some one as the value of the shares is subject to market forces. Various advantages keep on accruing to shareholders. For example, allotment of Bonus shares. There are general meetings held of the Companies in which a shareholder is required to be represented. The provision is enacted to ensure that the commerce does not suffer due to delay on the part of the legal heirs in establishing their rights of succession and claiming the shares of a Company.\n\n\tConsidering the consistent view taken by the Apex Court while interpreting the provisions relating to nominations under various Statutes (including the view in the recent decision in the case of Indrani Wahi), there is no reason to make a departure from the consistent view. The provisions of the Companies Act including Sections 109A and 109B, in the light of the object of the said Enactment, do not warrant any such departure. The so called vesting under Section 109A does not create a third mode of succession. It is not intended to create a third mode of succession. \n\n2010(4) ALL MR 51 Held not good law.\t\t\t\t [Para 32,34,35]"

Such an estate devolves upon all persons who are entitled to succession under law, custom or testament of the deceased-holder.

There has to be sufficient cause to condone the delay though the expression \"sufficient cause\" is liberally construed and is elastic enough to enable the Court to apply the law in a meaningful manner. There can be no dispute that while condoning the delay what matters is not the length of the period but the acceptability of the explanation offered to condone the delay. The Courts should not lose sight of the fact that by not taking steps within the time prescribed a valuable right accrues to the other party which cannot be lightly defeated by condoning the delay in a routine manner. Sufficient cause has to be considered with pragmatism and with justice oriented approach but any cause whatsoever cannot be construed as a sufficient cause and it is necessary for the Courts or the authorities to apply their mind to the cause shown and to satisfy themselves and to find out whether the cause shown is sufficient or not. Although the expression \"sufficient cause\" is liberally construed it does not mean that the Courts should readily accept whatever the party has stated to explain his default. If the Courts or authority accept anything and everything stated by a party, then such a party will have the last laugh at the cost of his adversary Courts and authorities are required to scrutinize the cause shown and would be justified in considering the merits of the evidence led to establish the same.

The Guardians and Wards Act was enacted in 1890 and the High Court exercising its ordinary original civil jurisdiction is considered a District Court under that Act. The High Court's jurisdiction has been ousted in the light of the provisions of the Family Courts Act in case of guardianship proceedings instituted by a relative of a minor for guardianship of the minor's person. Such a proceeding clearly falls within the purview of section 7 of the Family Courts Act. Therefore, only the Family Court would have jurisdiction in view of the provisions of section 20. By virtue of section 20, the Family Courts Act has an overriding effect over any other law.  However, the High Court will continue to exercise its ordinary original civil jurisdiction in respect of petitions relating to the guardianship of the property of a minor. Therefore, a Guardianship Petition seeking guardianship of the person of a minor filed by either the parents or any relative of a minor would lie before the Family Court, irrespective of whether there is a matrimonial dispute pending before that Court. The Petition in the instant case, therefore, is not maintainable before High Court exercising its Ordinary Original Civil Jurisdiction and is accordingly, returned to the Petitioner for presenting the same before the appropriate Court.

Welfare of the minor in such cases being the paramount consideration, the Court has to approach the issue regarding the validity and enforcement of a foreign decree or order carefully. Simply because a foreign Court has taken a particular view on any aspect concerning the welfare of the minor is not enough for the Courts in India to shut out an independent consideration of the matter. Objectivity is the only consideration in such type of cases. It does not mean that the order passed by a foreign Court is not even a factor to be kept in mind while deciding the welfare of the child. The orders relating to custody of children are by their very nature not final, but are interlocutory in nature and subject to modification at any future time upon proof of change of circumstances, requiring change of custody but such change in custody must be proved to be in the paramount interests of the child.\n\n\tIn nutshell, welfare of the child has to be appreciated in all possible manner. Any undertaking given in the divorce case between the couples is not binding upon the minor. All orders relating to custody of the minor must be considered to be temporary orders made in the existing circumstances. With the passage of time and with changed conditions and circumstances, the Court is entitled to vary such orders in the interest and welfare of the minor.\n\n\tThe consideration on the basis of Section 13 CPC would give rise to a situation that if the foreign judgment is found to be not in consonance with the welfare of the child, then the Court in India which is not a reciprocating territory can interfere in the custody issue. All these things are dependent upon quality of evidence to be led by parties during trial. Since minor cannot be party to the lis between the parents, any order passed on consent of the parents is not binding upon the minor. Sub Clauses (c), (d) and (f) of Section 13 CPC may give rise to certain questions which are required to be answered by the competent Court after receiving evidence from the parties. The foreign judgment can be one of the considerations before the Court while considering the issue on merits. It cannot be a solitary point for decision of the custody issue before the Court under Section 7 read with Section 9 of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890.\n\n2010 ALL SCR (O.C.C.) 66, 2010 ALL SCR 794 Ref. to. \t [Para 20,24]"

Taking in to account all the relevant facts as age, sex, religion, character and capacity of the proposed guardian, nearness of  kin to the minor, the paramount consideration is the welfare of a minor. It is for deciding this paramount consideration of the welfare of a minor that all other factors must be taken in to account.  [Para 13]\n\nIn the present case, the mother of the male child, aged about five years, made an application u/s 25 of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 for custody of her son.  She complained that the child was snatched away from her custody and was illegally detained by his father in his custody.  The father of the child was getting  salary of Rs.4,500/- p.m. and was required, from very nature of his job, to travel around.  He gave talak to the mother of the child and married a second wife.  The mother  was getting salary of Rs.3000/- p.m.\n\nHeld that the mother was entitled to the custody of her son.  That the father was drawing a higher salary than that of the mother was not relevant consideration.  For children of tender years, it is not money alone which matters.  It is the natural love and affection and particularly, the care which the mother can take that is more important and which has no substitute.  The welfare of the child was safer with the mother.  The father had a touring job.  Leaving his only son from his first wife to the case of his second wife, in preference to the natural mother, would not be in the best interest of the child.  He certainly needs love and affection of his natural mother who is anxious to bestow it upon her child.\nAIR 1973 SC 2090, AIR 1977 SC 1359, \nAIR 1982 SC 1276, AIR 1989 SC 401\nand (1993) 2 S.C.C. 6 7071.

It is also a matter involving sentimental attachment. Such a matter is to be approached and tackled carefully. A balance has to be struck between the attachment and sentiments of the parties towards the minor children and the welfare of the minors which is of paramount importance.\t\t [Para 9]\n\nAt the time of death of their mother the children were left in custody of their paternal grand parents with whom their father is staying and the attempt of the respondent No. 1 was to alter that position before the application filed by them is considered by the Family Court. For this purpose it was very relevant to consider whether leaving the minor children in custody of their father till the Family Court decides the matter would be so detrimental to the interest of the minors that their custody should be changed forthwith. The observations that the father is facing a criminal case, that he mostly resides in USA and that it is alleged that he is having an affair with another lady are, in our view; not sufficient to come to the conclusion that custody of the minors should be changed immediately. It is relevant to state here that the respondent No. 1 maternal grand-parents wanted immediate custody of the minor children for the purpose of performing certain obsequies in connection with the cremation ceremony of his deceased daughter and that purpose had been served by the order passed by the learned single Judge and such necessity for interim custody had ceased when the Division Bench passed the judgment/order under challenge.\t\t\t [Para 10]\n\nThe High Court appears to have overlooked the settled principle that custody orders by their nature can never be final; however, before a change is made it must be proved to be in the paramount interest of the children. In a sensitive matter like this no single factor can be taken to be decisive. Neither affluence nor capacity to provide comfortable living should cloud the consideration by the Court.\t\t\t\t\t [Para 11]"

Undoubtedly, in matters of transfer a certain degree of hardship is likely to be caused to the family.  There is, however no reason for the court to draw a presumption that a mother who has been granted custody of her child will not be in a position to look after the welfare of the child if she is transferred outside the state.  The drawing of such presumptions is most inappropriate in the context of contemporary realities.  Women, including single women are able to combine in themselves multitudinous roles of being able members of the workplace and successful homemakers.  An interpretation which is anachronistic to the rapidly evolving position of women in society must be discarded.

The paramount consideration should be given to the welfare of the child.  At the interview, the boy has expressed his willingness and desire to live only with his mother and was admitted by him that the mother will provide him good education.  The mother is also drawing pension of Rs.6,000/- p.m. and also having land and properties in her name.  When the boy says he prefers to live with his mother, it will be beneficial for the boy and his education for a better future.  The High Court, erred in allowing the appeal on the ground of remarriage of the appellant without considering the other aspects of the matter.  It is a matter of custody of the child and the paramount consideration should be the welfare of the child.  It is not in dispute the boy is living with his mother for the last several years and the separation at this stage will affect the mental condition and the education of the child and considering that the child himself attaches importance to his education if the custody is to be given to the father  will now affect his academic brilliance and future. The High Court, ought to have seen that the re-marriage cannot be taken as a ground for giving custody of the child.  There is also no finding by the High Court that the remarriage has adversely affected the mental condition of the minor child. In cases like the present one, the mother may have shortcomings but that does not imply that she is not deserving of the solace and custody of her child.  If the Court forms the impression that the mother is a normal and independent young woman and shows no indication of imbalance of mind in her, then in the end the custody of the minor child should not be refused to her or else we would be really assenting to the proposition that a second marriage involving a mother per se will operate adversely  to a claim of a mother for the custody of her minor child.

Generally, the matrimonial house or the house of the parents is considered the family residence of a minor unless and until there are extra ordinary reasons to arrive at a conclusion that the place of ordinary residence has been shifted. The circumstances under which a child has been compelled to reside at another place cannot be said to be a regular, normal or settled home. It cannot be laid down as a hard and fast rule that a minor child will be deemed to be permanently residing at a place where there is matrimonial home but depending on the circumstances, under which he has been removed from the matrimonial home will have to be considered to arrive at a conclusion whether the place where he has been shifted can be said to be a place where he ordinarily resides for the purpose of Section 9 of the Guardians and Wards Act.

                "description": "Custody of minor - Child aged 16, studying in intermediate, right from 25 days of birth in care of maternal grandmother and showing consistently good performance in education - Mother divorced her husband and married again - Order of custody in favour of mother, when child desires to remain in custody of grandmother, unjustified - Minor, when old enough to form an intelligent preference, his intelligent preference deserves to be given due weight - In interest of his welfare, he should not be disturbed from his environment at home at this stage - Contempt case dismissed as grandmother never refused minor child from going to mother. United Nations Conventions on the Rights of the Child, Articles 12 and 13.\n\nThe material welfare of the child includes stability, security, living environment and understanding care and guidance with which the minor child is acquainted for the last 16 years. It is also on record that the child was showing consistently good performance in education which is evidenced by the fact that in S.S.C. Examination this year, he got 556 out of 600 marks; which is a very impressive academic record. The minor child is now said to be studying intermediate and the intermediate examination being crucial for shaping career of a student, ensuring that the minor child is not disturbed from his environment at home appears to be crucial circumstance with respect to his welfare.   [Para 22]\n\nThe other circumstance which we have to statutorily take into consideration is with regard to the wishes of a minor child. The preference of the minor child, if he is intelligent enough, is one of the factors which is required to be taken into consideration as per the mandate of Section 17(3) of the Act. The minor child is intelligent and old enough and on more than one occasion, he has expressed his desire to remain in the custody of grandmother rather than his mother.   [Para 23,24]\n\nThe U.N. Convention records in para 1.9 that there are a wide range of laws in India which guarantee to a substantial extent the rights and entitlement as provided in the Constitution and in the UN Convention. It also referred in para 1.12 that in 1974, the Government of India adopted a National Policy for Children wherein several welfare measures are provided including creation of a National Children Fund. It is in the backdrop of these legislations and steps taken by Government of India, it joined a comity of Nations and reaffirmed the commitment to advance the cause of children by endorsing and signing the world declaration. The aforesaid convention was ratified by Government of India on 12-11-1992 and has taken all measures for implementing convention. The U.N. Convention would not affect any provision of a domestic law which is more conducive of the realisation of the rights of the child. The reference to Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 is already found in para 1.9 referred to above and the reliance of the learned counsel on Articles 12 and 13 of the Convention that if the child is capable of forming and expressing his views, in all matters affecting child, his views are required to be given due weightage, already find place in Section 17(3) of the Guardians and Wards Act referred to above. In that view of the matter, Section 25 as well as Section 17 of the Guardians and Wards Act sufficiently take care of the welfare aspect together with intelligent preference and views of the child who is capable of making intelligent preference with respect to his or her custody.

There is a presumption that a minor's parents would do their very best to promote their children's welfare and, if necessary, would not grudge any sacrifice of their own personal interest and pleasure. This presumption arises because of the natural, selfless affection normally expected from the parents for their children. From this point of view, in case of conflict or dispute between the mother and the father about the custody of their children, the approach has to be somewhat different from that adopted by the Letters Patent Bench of the High Court in this case. There is no dichotomy between the fitness of the father to be entrusted with the custody of his minor children and considerations of their welfare. The father's fitness has to be considered, determined and weighed predominantly in terms of the welfare of his minor children in the context of all the relevant circumstances. If the custody of the father cannot promote their welfare equally or better than the custody of the mother, then, he cannot claim indefeasible right to their custody under S. 25 merely because there is no defect in his personal character and he has attachment for his children -which every normal parent has. No doubt, the father has been presumed by the statute generally to be better fitted to look after the children - being normally the earning member and head of the family but the Court has in each case to see primarily to the welfare of' the children in determining the question of their custody, in the background of all the relevant facts having bearing on their health, maintenance and education. The family is normal1y the heart of our society and for a balanced and healthy growth of children it is highly desirable that they get their due share of affection and care from both the parents in their normal parental home. Where, however family dissolution due to some unavoidable circumstances becomes necessary the Court has to come to a judicial decision on the question of the welfare of the children on a full consideration of all the relevant circumstances.\t  [Para 14]"

For, the innocent life cannot be allowed to suffer due to tussle between relatives of his parents.  The considerations like his emotional attachment, better educational facility and upbringing are subsidiary as compared to the priority of making available proper medical facilities to him.  The willingness of the minor is one of the factor to be considered under Section 17(3) of the Guardian and Wards Act.  However, it is not the sole criteria.  The welfare of the minor is the only criteria while determining the question of custody.  The minors are gullible and are likely to express the thoughts and wishes of those who are in dominating position to tutor them.  The influence of tutoring process is likely to impair the testimony of the minor.  In the present case, minor Sudarshan candidly admits that he behaves as is directed by the maternal grandparents.  The willingness of the minor cannot, therefore, be the significant factor in such a situation.  Moreover the minor - Sudarshan is not a grown up child and is not yet capable to form an intelligent opinion as to the suitability of his guardian.  There appears nothing illegal in the impugned order only because wishes of the minor are not considered.  It is more probable that wishes of the appellants have been assiduously instilled into the minor.\n\nIn view of better treatment avenue available to minor with respondent, no interference in custody was warranted.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 9,15,16,20]"

The concept of custody is related to physical control over a person or property.  The concept of guardianship is akin to trusteeship.  A guardian is trustee in relation to the person of whom he is so appointed.  The position of guardian is more onerous than of mere custodian.  The custody may be for short duration and for specific purpose.  The custody of the minor, in the present case, may be handed over to the respondent with an object to ensure proper medical care and treatment.   [Para 19,20]"

The fitness of person seeking custody is also one of the important aspects.  In this case, the mother is partly fit in the sense that she has not remarried and has natural love and affection for the children.  So also, the father is partly fit in the sense that he too has not remarried and has financial capacity to provide better education to the children.  It appears from the affidavit of the father and photographs produced by him that Shahistabegum is residing in a hutment locality at small place i.e. Faizpur.  The appellant-Sayyad Sabdarali is gainfully self employed person.  He has shown readiness to provide better educational facility to the children.\n\nIn the present case it is true that Sayyad Sabdarali the father of the child resides in the house of his relative and his sister alongwith her children is also residing in the same house.

The Court exercises paren patrae jurisdiction in custody or guardianship wrangles; it steps in to secure the welfare of the hapless child of two adults whose personal differences and animosity has taken precedence over the future of their child. As per Section 7 of the Act, the interest of the minor is the only relevant factor for appointing of a guardian, and the rights of the mother and father are subservient thereto. In this scenario, the interest of the child would be best served by immediately appointing the Appellant as the guardian. Furthermore, it is also pressed to the fore that her own fundamental right to privacy will be violated if she is compelled to disclose the name and particulars of father of her child.\n\n Avowedly, the mother is best suited to care for her offspring, so aptly and comprehensively conveyed in Hindi by the word 'mamta'. Furthermore, recognizing her maternity would obviate the necessity of determining paternity. In situations such this, where the father has not exhibited any concern for his offspring, giving him legal recognition would be an exercise in futility. In today's society, where women are increasingly choosing to raise their children alone, no purpose would be served in imposing an unwilling and unconcerned father on an otherwise viable family nucleus. A man who has chosen to forsake his duties and responsibilities is not a necessary constituent for the wellbeing of the child.    [Para 1,4,9]"

Given that the term \"parent\" is not defined in the Act, we interpret it, in the case of illegitimate children whose sole caregiver is one of his/her parents, to principally mean that parent alone. Guardianship or custody orders never attain permanence or finality and can be questioned at any time, by any person genuinely concerned for the minor child, if the child's welfare is in peril. The uninvolved parent is therefore not precluded from approaching the Guardian Court to quash, vary or modify its orders if the best interests of the child so indicate. There is thus no mandatory and inflexible procedural requirement of notice to be served to the putative father in connection with a guardianship or custody petition preferred by the natural mother of the child of whom she is the sole caregiver.

As regards the non-convention countries, the law is that the Court in the country to which the child has been removed must consider the question on merits bearing the welfare of the child as of paramount importance and reckon the order of the foreign Court as only a factor to be taken into consideration, unless the Court thinks it fit to exercise summary jurisdiction in the interests of the child and its prompt return is for its welfare. In exercise of summary jurisdiction, the Court must be satisfied and of the opinion that the proceeding instituted before it was in close proximity and filed promptly after the child was removed from his/her native state and brought within its territorial jurisdiction, the child has not gained roots here and further that it will be in the child's welfare to return to his native state because of the difference in language spoken or social customs and contacts to which he/she has been accustomed or such other tangible reasons. In such a case the Court need not resort to an elaborate inquiry into the merits of the paramount welfare of the child but leave that inquiry to the foreign Court by directing return of the child. Be it noted that in exceptional cases the Court can still refuse to issue direction to return the child to the native state and more particularly inspite of a pre-existing order of the foreign Court in that behalf, if it is satisfied that the child's return may expose him to a grave risk of harm.\n\nThis means that the Courts in India, within whose jurisdiction the minor has been brought must \"ordinarily\" consider the question on merits, bearing in mind the welfare of the child as of paramount importance whilst reckoning the pre-existing order of the foreign Court if any as only one of the factors and not get fixated therewith. In either situation - be it a summary inquiry or an elaborate inquiry - the welfare of the child is of paramount consideration. Thus, while examining the issue the Courts in India are free to decline the relief of return of the child brought within its jurisdiction, if it is satisfied that the child is now settled in its new environment or if it would expose the child to physical or psychological harm or otherwise place the child in an intolerable position or if the child is quite mature and objects to its return.\n\nThe crucial question to be considered by the Court (in the country to which the child is removed) is to answer the issue according to the child's welfare. That has to be done bearing in mind the totality of facts and circumstances of each case independently. To put it differently, the principle of comity of courts cannot be given primacy or more weightage for deciding the matter of custody or for return of the child to the native state.

On plain reading of the provisions of Section 17, it is apparent that the Court is under an obligation to decide the issue of custody and guardianship not on the basis of legal rights but on the basis of the paramount consideration of the welfare of the minor children. In a case where contesting parties to a Petition under the said Act or under any other Enactment place compromise on record dealing with custody and visitation rights in relation to minors, the Court cannot accept compromise mechanically. Before accepting the compromise and permitting parties to act upon compromise, the Court has to apply its mind to the well settled law.

The expression used is \"Where the minor ordinarily resides\". Now whether the minor is ordinarily residing at a given place is primarily a question of intention which in turn is a question of fact. It may at best be a mixed question of law and fact, but unless the jurisdictional facts are admitted it can never be a pure question of law, capable of being answered without an enquiry into the factual aspects of the controversy. The word 'resides' implies something more than a flying visit to, or casual stay at a particular place. The question whether one is ordinarily residing at a given place depends so much on the intention to make that place ones ordinary abode. [Para 14,18,20]"

                "description": "Appointment of Guardian - Welfare of child of 11 years - Petitionerfather, a superrich, influential foreign national - Child born in India but having dual citizenship of Kenya and U.K. - Child in various personal interactions by Family Court, High Court and Supreme Court, found to be bright, self-confident and articulated - Had great clarity about his preferences and aspirations - Nationality, relevant aspect to be given due consideration - Educational opportunities which would be available to child is an aspect of great significance - Objection by mother that petitioner was being racist, not established - Allegation of marital infidelity against petitioner, not established - Pending criminal proceedings against petitioner for alleged dam outburst in his family farms, not valid ground to refuse custody of child to him - In view of facts it would be in best interest of child to transfer custody of child to his father i.e. petitioner - However, mother cannot be kept out of further growth, progress and company of her son - Thus, she would be provided with temporary custody of child for 50% of his annual vacations once a year either in New Delhi or Kenya - Custody of child handed over to father subject to obtaining mirror order from Kenyan Court to reflect directions given by Supreme Court. (Majority view - Per Indu Malhotra, J. (for herself and on behalf of Uday Umesh Lalit, J.)\n\nA reading of the plaint of the Guardianship petition shows that respondent father relies upon availability of his parents in Kenya to take care of the child and, on the other hand, stress on the physical condition of appellant\u2019s mother to look after the child. I find that the entire basis to seek appointment as guardian of the child is the availability of his parents in Kenya and the physical condition of appellant\u2019s mother. The entire basis is incorrect as in the presence of parents of the child, the grandparents are not the determining factor to appoint a guardian. The question of where does the welfare of the child lie thus narrows down to the mother who has stopped practicing law to nurture child as against the father who travels quite substantially every month. In the absence of the father, the child will be in the custody of nannies, maids and servants. The grandparents would not be able to take care of the growing needs of a young child. All things being equal, the presence of grandparents can tilt in balance but where a mother who is available 24/7 for guiding, caring and nurturing a growing child as against a father who needs to travel outside his normal place of stay frequently, I find that the mother is more suitable in whose hands the welfare of the child is secured. (Para 76)\n\nThe question required to be examined is whether this Court should permit the child to be out of its supervisory jurisdiction so as to be a mute spectator to the possibility of defiance of the order of this Court. I am of the opinion that welfare of the Child would be to stay in India with his mother who has brought up the child for last 11 years. The Child is intelligent but not mature enough to take decisions by himself. Even, the law recognizes that the child of less than 18 years is incapable of representing himself. Therefore, any opinion of the child is not determinative of the final custody of the child but this Court as parens patriae is duty bound to assess the entire situation to return a finding whether the welfare of the child will be with the mother with visitation rights to the father or custody with the father with visitation rights to the mother. If the child is moved to Kenya, there is no way that this Court can enforce the orders to get the child back to India, even if it so desires. (Para 124)"

Intrinsic in all these steps is to guarantee fair opportunity to all concerned. (Para 31)\n\nFamily Court is expected to follow procedure known to law, which means insist for a formal pleading to be filed by both sides, then frame issues for determination, record evidence of the parties to prove the facts asserted by the concerned party and only thereafter, to enter upon determination and render decision thereon by recording reasons for such decision. For doing this, the Family Court is expected to give notice to the respective parties and provide them sufficient time and opportunity to present their claim in the form of pleadings and evidence before determination of the dispute. Family Court, in the present case, exceeded its jurisdiction by hastening the entire proceedings. Indubitably, the Family Court is obliged to inquire into the matter as per the procedure prescribed by law. It does not have plenary powers to do away with the mandatory procedural requirements in particular, which guarantee fairness and transparency in the process to be followed and for adjudication of claims of both sides. The nature of inquiry before the Family Court is, indeed, adjudicatory. It is obliged to resolve the rival claims of the parties and while doing so, it must adhere to the norms prescribed by the statue in that regard and also the foundational principle of fairness of procedure and natural justice. (Paras 27, 29)\n\nIn the instant Case the appellant, father had filed the petition by invoking provisions of Section 7 of the 1890 Act read with Section 7(g) of the 1984 Act. Admittedly, no written statement was ever filed by the respondent to oppose the said petition. On the other hand, the appellant took out two applications for amendment of the pleadings under O.6 R.17 CPC. No reply was filed by the respondent even to these applications, despite Court directing her to do so vide order dated 4.10.2018. There is nothing on record to indicate that the Family Court decided these two applications for amendment of pleadings taken out by the appellant. Although the main objection alongwith two applications for amendment filed by the appellant remained pending from February, 2018, the respondent never filed response to the main petition or the amendment applications and instead took out application under Section 151 of the CPC for being appointed the sole and absolute guardian and custodian of the minor child, on 13.9.2019. This application was posted for hearing on 13.9.2019, on which date the Court issued notice to the appellant and his counsel. As per that order, the matter was again notified on 16.9.2019 when the counsel appearing for the appellant requested the Court to discharge him from the case, which request was acceded to by the Court. As a matter of fact, before discharging the counsel, the Family Court should have ensured that notice was given to the appellant about the request made by his counsel including to make alternative arrangements, if he so desired. Admittedly, no such notice was issued by the Family Court. Father dasti notice sent to the appellant was still awaited. The Family Court instead set down the main matter on 19.9.2019 at 2.30 p.m. In terms of order dated 16.9.2019, the Family Court additionally cancelled the already scheduled returnable date of 30.10.2019, unilaterally. There is nothing on record to show that the respondent had made such a request. Further before 19.9.2019, the respondent took out another application under O.I R.10 read with O.23 R.1A of the CPC for being transposed as petitioner in the guardianship petition and to transpose appellant as respondent therein, for the reasons stated in the application dated 18.9.2019. Admittedly, even copy of this application was not served on the appellant nor a formal notice came to be issued by the Family Court on this application, when it was taken up for hearing on 19.9.2019. Despite this the Family Court proceeded on assumption that the appellant abandoned the proceedings, disposed of the transposition application and declared the mother, respondent as sole, exclusive and absolute guardian and granted custody of minor child.\n\nHeld, the orders passed by the Family Court without notice to the appellant and without waiting for service of notice already issued on the former application. amounts to substantial non-compliance of the prescribed mandatory procedure and infraction of principles of natural justice, not a technical irregularity to be overlooked. The impugned judgment and orders of the Family Court came to be passed by the Family Court in a tearing hurry, may be because of the insistence of the respondent and her counsel to do so in light of the observations made by the High Court in habeas corpus and contempt matters against the appellant. The impugned judgment does make reference to those orders. Therefore the ex parte impugned judgment and orders dated 21.9.2019 passed by the Family Court on transposition application, as well as, on the application for declaration that the respondent mother is the sole, exclusive and absolute guardian and custodian of the minor child, liable to be set aside being illegal.

The crime was registered under Sections 498A, 304B, 302, 201 and Section 149 of IPC. Said complaint of dowry death was lodged by appellant/parents of deceased, with a delay of 6 months. However, as per initial police report, registration of said case was false. Though at instance of appellants, re-investigation into said case is directed, that cannot be a ground to decline custody of child to her father whose claim for custody is otherwise legitimate and justified. Serious allegations of offences under POCSO Act also made after the commencement of custody disputes. No medical record produced on record showing that any sexual offence was committed by respondent on his own daughter. In said case also, no progress is made by police. Neither statement of child was recorded by police nor respondent was arrested, indicating that it was also a false case.\n\n\tThe Family Court, before which such registration of crime is proved must necessarily apply its mind and endeavor to find out the true circumstances which activised the registration rather than being allured by the mere fact of registration. Unless a very cautious approach is adopted by the Family Court to ensure that information on which crime was registered is not frivolous and vexatious, many a innocent parent fighting for custody of his own ward would be victim of false implication of crimes under the POCSO Act. There is a growing tendency in the recent years to foist false crimes against the biological father alleging sexual abuse of own child misusing the provisions of the POCSO Act when serious fight for custody of ward is pending resolution before the Family Courts. The Family Courts to whose notice registration of crime under the POCSO Act is brought owe an onerous responsibility to ensure that the registration of crime against the parent is not a ruse for defeating his legitimate claim for custody of the ward. The Family Courts ought to examine the outcome of investigation of the crime placed before the court and also take into consideration all relevant facts and circumstances which would help the Judge form a prima facie opinion as to whether the allegation of sexual abuse of the ward is baseless or not. Each case requires to be approached and evaluated on its own facts. It does not mean to say that Family Courts should disregard the materials collected by the investigating agency in the crime and hold a total independent enquiry in order to get at the truth or veracity of the allegation. Unless there are reliable materials capable enough to convince the allegation of sexual abuse to be well founded, mere registration of crime shall not be reckoned as a ground for rejecting the claim of the parent for custody of the child. 2008 ALL SCR 2016, 2010(1) ALL MR (JOURNAL) 49 Disting. \t [Para 24,28]"

The mother may be a de facto guardian but would never be regarded as a de jure guardian in respect of property of the minor. The power of a guardian appointed by a Court to dispose of movable property is limited to the extent of movable properties. That too, it shall be so disposed of carefully as a prudent man deal with it if it were his own. This legal position is quite clear in view of section 27 of the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890. Article 364 of the Mohammedan Law (by Mulla), (19th Edition by M. Hidayatullah and Arshad Hidayatullah) would make it manifest that a de facto guardian under Article 361 has no power to transfer any right or interest in the immovable property of the minor. Such a transfer would not be merely voidable, but would be void. A mother is only a de facto guardian and a bare custodian of property of minor son. She does not possess power to sell, mortgage, or otherwise deal with immovable property belonging to the minor. She has no larger powers to deal with her minor child's property than a stranger or non-relative who happens to have charge of the minor for time being.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 11]"

In determining the question as to who should be given custody of a minor child, the paramount consideration is the 'welfare of the child' and not rights of the parents under a statute for the time being in force. Merely because there is no defect in fathers' personal care and his attachment for his children-which every normal parent has, he would not be granted custody. Simply because the father loves his children and is not shown to be otherwise undesirable does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the welfare of the children would be better promoted by granting their custody to him. Children are not mere chattels nor are they toys for their parents. Absolute right of parents over the destinies and the lives of their children, in the modern changed social conditions must yield to the considerations of their welfare as human beings so that they may grow up in a normal balanced manner to be useful members of the society and the guardian court in case of a dispute between the mother and the father, is expected to strike a just and proper balance between the requirements of welfare of the minor children and the rights of their respective parents over them. When the court is confronted with conflicting demands made by the parents, each time it has to justify the demands. The Court has not only to look at the issue on legalistic basis, in such matters human angles are relevant for deciding those issues. The court then does not give emphasis on what the parties say, it has to exercise a jurisdiction which is aimed at the welfare of the minor.  \t\t\t\t\t [Para 35,40,42]\n\nThe word 'welfare' used in Section 13 of the Act has to be construed literally and must be taken in its widest sense. The moral and ethical welfare of the child must also weigh with the Court as well as its physical well being. Though the provisions of the special statutes which govern the rights of the parents or guardians may be taken into consideration, there is nothing which can stand in the way of the Court exercising its parens patriae jurisdiction arising in such cases. The trump card in appellants' argument is that the child is living since long with the father. The argument is attractive. But the same overlooks a very significant factor. By flouting various orders, leading even to initiation of contempt proceedings, the appellant has managed to keep custody of the child. He can not be a beneficiary of his own wrongs. It is true that taking the child out of the father's custody may cause some problems, but that is bound to be neutralized.   [Para 43,44,45]"

Indubitably the provisions of law pertaining to the custody of a child contained in either the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 (Section 17) or the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 (Section 13) also hold out the welfare of the child as a predominant consideration.  In fact, no statute, on the subject, can ignore, eschew or obliterate the vital factor of the welfare of the minor.  The question of welfare of the minor child has again to be considered in the background of the relevant facts and circumstances.  Each case has to be decided on its own facts and other decided cases can hardly serve as binding precedents insofar as the factual aspects of the case are concerned.  It is, no doubt, true that father is presumed by the statutes to be better suited to look after the welfare of the child, being normally the working member and head of the family, yet in each case the Court has to see primarily to the welfare of the child in determining the question of his or her custody.  Better financial resources of either of the parents or their love for the child may be one of the relevant considerations but cannot be the sole determining factor for the custody of the child.

                "description": "Custody of minor child - Factors to be considered - Controlling consideration governing the custody of the minor is the welfare and well-being of the child concerned and not the right of their parents - Discretion vested in Court to be exercised judiciously - Father's fitness cannot override considerations of the welfare of the minor children - Court while dealing with the custody cases, is neither bound by statutes nor by strict rules of evidence or procedure nor by precedents - In selecting a guardian, the Court is expected to given due weight to the child's ordinary comfort, contentment, health, education, intellectual development and favourable surroundings.\n\n(i)\tThe father in the case of a Hindu minor boy is the natural guardian of the person during his minority and it is permissible for the court to remove him from that position and to appoint either the mother and if the mother is also unfit somebody else as the guardian of the person of the minor boy if in the opinion of the court the father is unfit to be the guardian of the person of the minor. The controlling consideration governing the custody of the minor is the welfare and well-being of the child concerned and not the right of their parents.\n\n(ii)\tThe discretion vested in the Court is, as is the case with all judicial discretions, to be exercised judiciously in the background of all relevant facts and circumstances. Each case has to be decided on its own facts and other cases can hardly serve as binding precedents.\n\n(iii)\tThe father's fitness has to be considered, determined and weighed predominantly in terms of the welfare of his minor children in the context of all the relevant circumstances. If the custody of the father cannot promote their welfare equally or better than the custody of the mother, then he cannot claim indefeasible right to their custody merely because there is no defect in his personal character and he has attachment for his children - which every normal parent has. In short, the father's fitness cannot override considerations of the welfare of the minor children.\n\n(iv)\tMerely because the father loves his children and is not shown to be otherwise undesirable cannot necessarily lead to the conclusion that the welfare of the children would be better promoted by granting their custody to him as against the wife who may also equally be affectionate towards her children and otherwise equally free from blemish.\n\n(v)\tSection 6 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act constitutes the father as the natural guardian of a minor. But that provision cannot supersede paramount consideration as to what is conducive to the welfare of the minor.\n\n(vi)\tThe father's right to custody of the minor children is neither an absolute nor an indefeasible one. The welfare of the child should be the paramount consideration. The mother can also be given custody of the minors, if their welfare or interest should require it, even if the father is otherwise fit to act as guardian.\n\n(vii)\tFemale child on the advent of puberty primarily requires mother's care and attention. Absence of female company in the house of the father is relevant factor.\n\n(viii)\tWhere the child is not in a position to express any intelligent preference between his/her parents, mature thinking is necessary to decide as to what will enure to his/her benefit welfare.\n\n(ix)\tIn case of dispute between the mother and the father regarding custody of their child, the paramount consideration is welfare of the child and not the legal rights of either of the parties. The Court, therefore, should examine what is in the best interest of the child, whether her welfare would be better looked after if she is given in the custody of either the father or the mother. Such cases cannot be decided solely by interpreting legal provisions.\n\n(x)\tA court while dealing with the custody cases, is neither bound by statutes nor by strict rules of evidence or procedure nor by precedents. In selecting proper guardian of a minor, the paramount consideration should be the welfare and well-being of the child.\n\n(xi)\tIn selecting a guardian, the court is expected to give due weight to the child's ordinary comfort, contentment, health, education, intellectual development and favourable surroundings. But over and above, physical comforts, moral and ethical value cannot be ignored. They are equally important, essential and indispensable considerations. 2000(3) ALL MR (S.C.) 667, 2005 ALL MR (Cri) 1822 (S.C.) & 2001(2) ALL MR 237 (S.C.) - Ref. to.\t [Para 11]"

It is thus a public authority as defined under Section 2(h) of the Act. Having thus come to such conclusion, the Court is not required to examine whether such Market Committee could be said to be owned, controlled or substantially financed by the funds of the Government so as to be covered by Section 2(h) of the Act. However, even on such aspect, considering the provisions of the Market Act, it clearly appears that it is neither owned by the Government nor could it be said that it is controlled by the State Government or substantially financed by the Government. Chapter of Control in the Market Act is to ensure that the Market Committee functions in accordance with the provisions of the Act and to achieve the object and purpose of the Act. Thus, regulatory measures are provided to ensure that Market Committee conducts its affairs as required by the Market Act. The Market Committee has to generate its fund, called as 'Market Fund' by levying and collection of market fees and like the State Government, Market Committee is under statutory obligation to provide proportionate funds, as required by the provisions of the Act, to the statutory Board constituted for good object relating to up-liftment of the farmers and for achieving the object and purpose as regards regulating of buying and selling of the agricultural produce. Therefore, it cannot be said that the Market Committee is either controlled by the State Government or in any way, could be said to be substantially financed by the State Government. \t [Para 34]"

One becomes a member in a co-operative society either at the time of its formation or acquires membership in it on possessing the requisite qualification under the bye-laws of the society and on being accepted as a member. It is not as if one has a fundamental right to become a member of a co-operative society. But certainly, if the application of one for membership, who is otherwise qualified to be a member under the Act, Rules and the bye-laws of the society, is rejected unreasonably or for frivolous reasons, the person may be entitled to enforce his claim to become a member in an appropriate forum or court of law. It is one thing to say that it is not desirable to restrict membership in a society based solely on religion or sex but it is quite different thing to say that any such voluntary approved bye-law containing such a restriction could be ignored or declared unconstitutional by an authority or a tribunal created under the Act itself. The Constitution no doubt provides that in any State action there shall be no discrimination based either on religion or on sex. But Part III of the Constitution has not interfered with the right of a citizen to enter into a contract for his own benefit and at the same time incurring a certain liability arising out of the contract. Unless appropriate amendments are brought to the various Co-operative Societies Acts incorporating a policy that no society shall be formed or if formed, membership in no society shall be confined to persons of a particular persuasion, religion, belief or region, it could not be said that a society would be disentitled to refuse membership to a person who is not duly qualified to be one in terms of its bye-laws. By introducing a theory of what the court considers to be public policy, a society registered under the Co-operative Societies Act, cannot be directed to admit a member who is not qualified to be a member in terms of its duly registered bye-laws.  [Para 15,16,17,18]\n\nUnder the Indian Contract Act, a person sui juris has the freedom to enter into a contract. The bye-laws of a co-operative society setting out the terms of membership to it, is a contract entered into by a person when he seeks to become a member of that society. Even the formation of the society is based on a contract. This freedom to contract available to a citizen cannot be curtailed or curbed relying on the fundamental rights enshrined in Part III of the Constitution of India against State action. A right to enforce a fundamental right against State action, cannot be extended to challenge a right to enter into a contract giving up an absolute right in oneself in the interests of an association to be formed or in the interests of the members in general of that association. This is also in lieu of advantages derived by that person by accepting a membership in the Society. The restriction imposed, is generally for retaining the identity of the society and to carry forward the object for which the society was originally formed. It is, therefore, a fallacy to consider, in the context of co-operative societies, that the surrendering of an absolute right by a citizen who becomes a member of that society, could be challenged by the said member by taking up the position that the restriction he had placed on himself by entering into the contract, is in violation of his fundamental right of freedom of movement, trade or right to settle in any part of the country. He exercises his right of association when he becomes a member of a society by entering into a contract with others regulating his conduct vis-a-vis the society, the members constituting it, and submerging his rights in the common right to be enjoyed by all and he is really exercising his right of association guaranteed by Article 19(l)(c) of the Constitution of India in that process. His rights merge in the rights of the society and are controlled by the Act and the bye-laws of the society.   [Para 21]\n\nIn the context of the freedom of contract available to a person and in the context of the right to form an association guaranteed by Article 19(1)(c) of the Constitution of India, and the law governing such an association, courts have to be cautious in trying to ride the unruly horse of public policy in acceding to a challenge to a qualification for membership in the bye-laws, not tabbo under the Act and the Rules themselves.   [Para 23]\n\nThe argument, therefore, that herein, a member should be relieved of the obligation undertaken by him while joining the Society or becoming its member or while seeking permission to put up a multi-storeyed construction, should be relieved of the restriction, he has agreed to, on the ground that the same might affect his fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 19(1)(d) or (g) of the Constitution of India or that it offends Article 300A of the Constitution.   [Para 24]\n\nIn secular India it may be somewhat retrograde to conceive of co-operative societies confined to group of members or followers of a particular religion, a particular mode of life, a particular persuasion. But that is different from saying that you cannot have a co-operative society confined to persons of a particular persuasion, belief, trade, way of life or a religion. A co-operative society is not a State unless the tests indicated in Ajay Hasia are satisfied. There is no case here that the appellant society satisfies the tests laid down by Ajay Hasia so as to be considered to be a State within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution. The fundamental rights in Part III of the Constitution are normally enforced against State action or action by other authorities who may come within the purview of Article 12 of the Constitution. It is not possible to argue that a person has a fundamental right to become a member of a voluntary association or of a co-operative society governed by its own bye-laws. So long as this position holds, we are of the view that it is not possible especially for a Registrar who is an authority under the Co-operative Societies Act, to direct a co-operative society to admit as a member, a person who does not qualify to be a member as per the bye-laws registered under the Act. Nor can a Registrar direct in terms of Section 14 of the Act to amend the bye-laws since it could not be said that such an amendment, as directed in this case is necessary or desirable in the interests of the appellant society. What is relevant under Section 14 of the Act is the interests of the society and the necessity in the context of that interest. It is not the interest of an individual member or an aspirant to a membership. \t\t\t\t\t  [Para 26]\n\nIt is true that our Constitution has set goals for ourselves and one such goal is the doing away with discrimination based on religion or sex. But that goal has to be achieved by legislative intervention and not by the court coining a theory that whatever is not consistent with the scheme or a provision of the Constitution, be it under Part III or Part IV thereof, could be declared to be opposed to public policy by the court.

                "description": "Co-operative housing society - Bye-laws stipulating that property can be transferred back only to society or with prior permission to a person qualified to be a member of society - Such a bye-law is not in absolute restraint on alienation offending S.10 of T.P. Act.\n\nSection 10 of the Transfer of Property Act relieves a transferee of immoveable property from an absolute restraint placed on his right to deal with the property in his capacity as an owner thereof. As per Section 10, a condition restraining alienation would be void. The Section applies to a case where property is transferred subject to a condition or limitation absolutely restraining the transferee from parting with his interest in the property. For making such a condition invalid, the restraint must be an absolute restraint. It must be a restraint imposed while the property is being transferred to the transferee. Here, respondent No.2 became a member of the Society on the death of his father. He subscribed to the bye-laws. He accepted Section 30 of the Act and the other restrictions placed on a member. Respondent No.2 was qualified to be a member in terms of the bye-laws. His father was also a member of the Society. The allotment of the property was made to appellant in his capacity as a member. There was really no transfer of property to respondent No.2. He inherited it with the limitations thereon placed by Section 31 of the Act and the bye-laws. His right to become a member depended on his possessing the qualification to become one as per the bye-laws of the Society. He possessed that qualification. The bye-laws provide that he should have the prior consent of the Society for transferring the property or his membership to a person qualified to be a member of the Society. These are restrictions in the interests of the Society and its members and consistent with the object with which the Society was formed. He cannot question that restriction. It is also not possible to say that such a restriction amounts to an absolute restraint on alienation within the meaning of Section 10 of the Transfer of Property Act. The restriction, if any, is a self-imposed restriction. It is a restriction in a contract to which the father of respondent No.2 was a party and to which respondent No.2 voluntarily became a party. It is difficult to postulate that such a qualified freedom to transfer a property accepted by a person voluntarily, would attract Section 10 of the Act. Moreover, it is not as if it is an absolute restraint on alienation. Respondent No.2 has the right to transfer the property to a person who is qualified to be a member of the Society as per its bye-laws. At best, it is a partial restraint on alienation. Such partial restraints are valid if imposed in a family settlement, partition or compromise of disputed claims. So, when a person accepts membership in a co-operative society by submitting himself to its bye-laws and secures an allotment of a plot of land or a building in terms of the bye-laws and places on himself a qualified restriction in his right to transfer the property by stipulating that the same would be transferred back to the society or with the prior consent of the society to a person qualified to be a member of the society, it cannot be held to be an absolute restraint on alienation offending Section 10 of the Transfer of Property Act. He has placed that restriction on himself in the interest of the collective body, the society. He has voluntarily submerged his rights in that of the society.   [Para 35,36]\n\nThe fact that the rights of a member or an allottee over a building or plot is attachable and saleable in enforcement of a decree or an obligation against him cannot make a provision like the one found in the bye-laws, an absolute restraint on alienation to attract Section 10 of the Transfer of Property Act. Of course, it is property in the hands of the member on the strength of the allotment. It may also be attachable and saleable in spite of the volition of the allottee. But that does not enable the Court to hold that the condition that an allotment to the member is subject to his possessing the qualification to be a member of the co-operative society or that a voluntary transfer by him could be made only to the society itself or to another person qualified to be a member of the society and with the consent of the society could straightway be declared to be an absolute restraint on alienation and consequently an interference with his right to property protected by Article 300-A of the Constitution of India.

The contention of the learned counsel for the Petitioner is that at the highest, that may have been possible if the recovery is to be made in the same State.  However, as it is not government dues, the recovery cannot be made as arrears of land revenue in the district which is not falling in the State of Gujarat.  The language of Section 3 and 5 of the Recovery Act makes it clear that not only arrears of land revenue can be recovered under the Recovery Act but all sums recoverable as arrears of land revenue.  In other words, any amount can be recovered, as long as it is the amount which is capable of being recovered as arrears of land revenue.  In the instant case, the Development Act itself permits the recovery of dues as arrears of land revenue.  Once that be the case, the amount would fall under the expression \"sum recoverable as arrears of land revenue\".  The purpose behind the Revenue Recovery Act is to enable the Collector of District wherein the property is situated to recover from the defaulter all sums of money which are capable of being recovered either as land revenue or which can be recovered as arrears of land revenue.  The object behind it is that there must be public mechanism or body which can recover the amounts from a defaulter in a district where he has property considering that these are public dues.

                "description": "Word \"Consultation\" - Meaning of.\n\nThe object of consultation is to render its process meaningful, so that it may serve its intended purpose. Consultation requires the meeting of minds between the parties that are involved in the consultative process, on the basis of material facts and points, in order to arrive at a correct, or at least a satisfactory solution. If a certain power can be exercised only after consultation, such consultation must be conscious, effective, meaningful and purposeful. To ensure this, each party must disclose to the other, all relevant facts, for due deliberation. The consultee must express his opinion only after complete consideration of the matter, on the basis of all the relevant facts and quintessence. Consultation may have different meanings in different situations, depending upon the nature and purpose of the statute.\n\nThe meaning of consultation varies from case to case, depending upon its fact-situation and the context of the statute, as well as the object it seeks to achieve. Thus, no straight-jacket formula can be laid down in this regard. Ordinarily, consultation means a free and fair discussion on a particular subject, revealing all material that the parties possess, in relation to each other, and then arriving at a decision. However, in a situation where one of the consultees has primacy of opinion under the statute, either specifically contained in a statutory provision, or by way of implication, consultation may mean concurrence. The court must examine the fact-situation in a given case to determine whether the process of consultation, as required under the particular situation did in fact, stand complete.\n\n(2010) 11 SCC 1 Rel.on.\t           [Para 9,16]"

A conjoint reading of Sections 4 and 6 of the Act, 1986, makes it clear that the Lokayukta must be entirely independent and free from all political and commercial associations. Investigation proceedings by the Lokayukta, must be conducted in a formal manner. The appointment must, as far as possible, be non-political and the status of the Lokayukta, must be equivalent to that of the highest judicial functionaries in the State. The Act, 1986 provides for a proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 3 of Act, 1986, which envisages the appointment of the Lokayukta when the Legislative Assembly has been dissolved, or when a Proclamation of Emergency under Article 356 of the Constitution is in operation, upon consultation with the Chief Justice of the State and the Leader of Opposition. However, such consultation with the Leader of Opposition also stands dispensed with, if the Assembly is dissolved or suspended. Thus, it is evident that the Governor can appoint a Lokayukta, even when there is no Council of Ministers in existence.\n\nThe aforesaid statutory provisions make it mandatory on the part of the State to ensure that the office of the Lokayukta is filled up without any delay, as the Act provides for such filling up, even when the Council of Ministers is not in existence.\t    [Para 38]"

A pliant Lokayukta may not be able to take effective and required measures to curb the menace of corruption.\n\nThe adverse impact of lack of probity in public life leads to a high degree of corruption. Corruption often results from patronage of statutory/higher authorities and it erodes quality of life, and it has links with organized crimes, economic crimes like money laundering etc., terrorism and serious threats to human security to flourish. Its impact is disastrous in the developing world as it hurts the poor disproportionately by diverting funds intended for development. Corruption generates injustice as it breeds inequality and become major obstacle to poverty alleviation and development.\n\nA pliant Lokayukta therefore, would render the Act completely meaningless/ineffective, as he would no doubt reject complaints under Section 7 of the Act, at the instance of the government, taking the prima facie view that there is no substance in the complaint, and further, he may also make a suggestion under Section 20 of the said Act, to exclude a public functionary, from the purview of the Act, which may include the Chief Minister himself. Thus, Section 3 of the Act, 1986 must be construed in the light of meaning given by the courts to the word 'consultation' so as to give effect to the provisions of the statute to make it operative and workable. \t\t\t\t\t    [Para 61,63,69]"

A general word like 'building' must be construed to reasonably extend to all ancillary and subsidiary matters and the common parlance test adopted by the High Court to hold the meaning of levy of tax on building and machinery does not appear to be right keeping in mind the established and accepted principles of interpretation of a constitutional provision or a Legislative Entry. A dynamic, rather than a pedantic view has to be preferred if the constitutional document is to meet the challenges of a fast developing world throwing new frontiers of challenge and an ever changing social order.\n\n\tThe regulatory power of the Municipal Corporations, Municipalities and Panchyats in the matter of installation, location and operation of 'Mobile Towers' even before the specific incorporation of Mobile Towers in the Gujarat Act by the 2011 Amendment and such control under the Bombay Act at all points of time would also be a valuable input to accord a reasonable extension of such power and control by understanding the power of taxation on 'Mobile Towers' to be vested in the State Legislature under Entry 49 of List II of the Seventh Schedule.\n\n\tFurther, if the aspect of measure of levy is seen, under both the Acts (Bombay/Gujarat Provincial Municipal Corporations Act, 1949), read with the relevant Rules, tax on Mobile Towers is levied on the yield from the land and building calculated in terms of the rateable value of the land and building. Also the incidence of the tax is not on the use of the plant and machinery in the Mobile Tower; rather it is on the use of the land or building, as may be, for purpose of the mobile tower. That the tax is imposed on the \"person engaged in providing telecommunication services through such mobile towers\" (Section 145A of the Gujarat Act) merely indicates that it is the occupier and not the owner of the land and building who is liable to pay the tax. Such a liability to pay the tax by the occupier instead of the owner is an accepted facet of the tax payable on land and building under Entry 49 List II of the Seventh Schedule.\n\n(1975) 2 SCC 274, (1975) 2 SCC 175, (1995) 1 Supp SCC 707, AIR1965 SC 1561 Ref. to. \t\t  [Para 28,29,30]"

Most of those statutes provide that the Tribunal, while dealing with appeals, references, revisions, would act giving strict adherence to the procedure prescribed in the CPC, for deciding a matter as followed by the Civil Court and certain powers have also been conferred upon it, as provided in the Cr.P.C. and IPC. Thus, the Tribunal is akin to a court and performs similar functions. In such a fact-situation, the consultation/concurrence of the High Court, in the matter of making the appointment of the President of the Tribunal is required. The object of consultation is to render the consultation meaningful to serve the intended purpose. It requires the meeting of minds between the parties involved in the process of consultation on the basis of material facts and points, to evolve a correct or at least satisfactory solution. If the power can be exercised only after consultation, consultation must be conscious, effective, meaningful and purposeful. It means that the party must disclose all the facts to other party for due deliberation. The consultee must express his opinion after full consideration of the matter upon the relevant facts and quintessence. Thus, it is evident from the above that the procedure to be observed under Article 234 of the Constitution goes to the extent of the true meaning of consultative process and not an empty formality.

This section is split into five sub-sections. Sub-section (1) of Section 89A deals with those lands for which no permission is required under sub-section (1) of Section 65B of the Bombay Land Revenue Code, 1879, i.e. lands such as those in industrial zone etc. It lays down that nothing in Section 89 will prohibit the sale or the agreement of sale of such zonal land in favour of any person for use of such land by such person for a bona-fide industrial purpose. Section 89A, creates an exception to Section 89 by allowing a sale of land for bonafide industrial purpose in certain cases as contemplated under the said section. These requirements are laid down in the provisos (a) to (d) of sub-section (1) and in sub-section (2) to (4) of Section 89A.\t\t     [Para 46]\n\nWhere the purchaser fails to start the industrial activity as stipulated above, Section 89A (5) requires the Collector to hold an enquiry, wherein he has to give the purchaser an opportunity of being heard. Thereafter, if he confirms such a view, he is expected to pass an order that the land shall vest in the Government which will, however, be done after determining appropriate compensation payable to the purchaser, which has to be done having regard to the price paid by the purchaser. Then the land shall be disposed of by the Government having regard to the use of the land. Thus, the only authority contemplated under the section is the Collector, and the decision is to be taken at his level. It is only in the event of his refusing to give the certificate of purchase for bonafide industrial purpose that an appeal lies to the State Government. Thus, where one wants to purchase agricultural land for industrial purposes, one has to first obtain the permission of the Industries Commissioner. The purchaser has also to inform the Collector about the purchase within 30 days of such purchase, and obtain a certificate that the land is purchased for a bonafide industrial purpose. He has to see to it that the industrial activity starts in three years from the date of such certificate, and the production of goods and services also starts within five years thereof, which period can be extended by the State Government, in an appropriate case. In the event the purchaser fails to commence such industrial activity, the Collector has to make an enquiry, and thereafter pass an appropriate order of resumption of the land on determining the compensation. Thus, the entire authority in this behalf is with the Collector and none other.\t\t     [Para 47]"

If the law requires a particular thing should be done in a particular manner it must be done in that way and none other. The State cannot ignore the policy intent and the procedure contemplated by the statute. In the instant case, the State could have acquired the land, and then either by auction or by considering the merit of the proposal of respondent No.5 allotted it to him. Assuming that the application of the Respondent No 5 was for a bona-fide purpose, the same had to be examined by the industrial commissioner, to begin with, and thereafter it should have gone to the collector. After the property vests in the Government, even if there were other bidders to the property, the collector could have considered the merits and the bona-fides of the application of Respondent No. 5, and nothing would have prevented him from following the course which is permissible under the law. It is not merely the end but the means which are of equal importance, particularly if they are enshrined in the legislative scheme. The minimum that was required was an enquiry at the level of the Collector who is the statutory authority. Dictating him to act in a particular manner on the assumption by the Minister that it is in the interest of the industrial development would lead to a breach of the mandate of the statute framed by the legislature. The Ministers are not expected to act in this manner and therefore, this particular route through the corridors of the Ministry, contrary to the statute, cannot be approved.\t    [Para 64]"

                "description": "Town planning scheme u/s.40(3)(jj) - In respect of land already de-reserved for time lapse u/s.20 - Permissible - Section 20 falls under Chap.II of Act which deals with development plan, a macro plan for vast area - Whereas Section 40 falls in Chap.V which provides for town planning scheme, a minor scheme within town - They are two different things - Lapsing of reservation under Development Plan does not take it out from purview of Town Planning Scheme. \n\n\tSo far as the question that upon lapsing of designation under the development plan under Section 20 there cannot be any reservation/designation under a town planning scheme for the same land u/s.40(3)(jj), is to be understood reading the provisions of the Gujarat Town Planning and Urban Development Act, 1976 cogently. The development plan is prepared under Chapter II and town planning scheme is made under Chapter V. Therefore, they are two different things. The development plan is a macro plan for a vast area wherein a town planning scheme is minor scheme within the town. Section 40(1) simply provides that in the making of town planning scheme the authority has to have regard to the final development of the plan, if any. Thus, the words \"having regard to the development plan\" in Section 40 means that town planning scheme cannot disregard or ignore the designation/reservation made in the development plan. Under Section 20 of the Act, it is provided that if an acquisition does not take place by agreement or under the Act 1894, in respect of certain lands designated in the final development plan for the six purposes mentioned in sub-section (2) of Section 12 within a period of 10 years from the coming into force of the final development plan, the designation of the land under these clauses shall be deemed to have lapsed. Therefore, the provision for lapsing of the designation of the land does not take it out of the purview of town planning scheme and such a provision does not prevent the making of a provision in a town planning scheme for any reservation specified in Section 40(3). If any contrary interpretation is approved, the town planning scheme would be impermissible. Thus, even after the lapse of designation of the land under Section 20, a town planning scheme will have to include the land for roads, open spaces, gardens under Section 40(3)(e), reservation of land for accommodation to members of socially and economically backward classes of people under Clause 40(3)(j) but not for items mentioned in Section 40(3)(jj)(a) would lead to absurdity. Section 40(3)(jj) only regulates discretion of the Area Development Authority (ADA) while making the draft development plan. The land acquired under Section 20 read with Section 12 of the Act 1976 would need infrastructural facility and the original plot which is acquired would require to be re-constituted as a final plot and to make a building site. The settled legal proposition in respect of interpretation of statute is that the provisions of the Act have to be read as a whole and therefore the provision of Section 40(3)(jj)(a)(iv) for sale has to be read inconsonance/conjointly with the other statutory provisions and not in isolation. The sale upto the extent of 15% is from the total area covered under the scheme and not in respect of every plot of land. In order to generate financial resources for the development of infrastructure, the saleable plot for residential, commercial and industrial use are allotted by the appropriate authority. Similarly, while re-constituting the plots, final plot is offered to the original owner for its beneficial use.\n\n The provisions of the Town Planning Scheme in Chapter-V, no where indicate that the lands under Section 20 cannot be subject matter of the Town Planning Scheme. Any interpretation contrary to this would tantamount to rewriting the provisions of the Act 1976.  [Para 29,30,31]"

It may even refuse to accord sanction to the draft development plan and direct to prepare a fresh development plan under the provisions of the Act. Indeed a very wide power is conferred upon the State Government in the matter of sanctioning of the draft development plan.  [Para 19]\n\nThe State Government's jurisdiction to make substantial modifications in the draft development plan is inter-twined with the formation of its opinion that such substantial modifications are necessary in the draft development plan. The State Government without forming any such opinion cannot publish the modifications considered necessary along with notice inviting suggestions or objections. Formation of opinion is a condition precedent for setting the law in motion proposing substantial modifications in the draft development plan.  [Para 20,21]\n\nThe power conferred by Section 17(1)(a) (ii) read with proviso is a conditional power. It is not an absolute power to be exercised in the discretion of the State Government. The condition is formation of opinion - subjective, no doubt - that it had become necessary to make substantial modifications in the draft development plan. This opinion may be formed on the basis of material sent along with the draft development plan or on the basis of relevant information that may be available with the State Government. The existence of relevant material is a pre-condition to the formation of opinion. The use of word \"may\" indicates not only a discretion but an obligation to consider that a necessity has arisen to make substantial modifications in the draft development plan. It also involves an obligation to consider which of the several steps specified in sub-clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) should be taken. Opinion to be formed by the State Government cannot be on imaginary grounds, wishful thinking, however, laudable that may be. Such a course is impermissible in law. The formation of the opinion, though subjective, must be based on the material disclosing that a necessity had arisen to make substantial modifications in the draft development plan. The expression : \"so considered necessary\" is again of crucial importance. The term \"consider\" means to think over; it connotes that there should be active application of the mind. In other words the term \"consider\" postulates consideration of all the relevant aspects of the matter. A plain reading of the relevant provision suggests that the State Government may publish the modifications only after consideration that such modifications have become necessary. The word \"necessary\" means indispensable, requisite; indispensably requisite, useful, incidental or conducive; essential; unavoidable; impossible to be otherwise; not to be avoided; inevitable. The word \"necessary\" must be construed in the connection in which it is used.\t\t\t\t [Para 23,24,25]\n\nThe expression \"is of opinion\", that substantial modifications in the draft development plan and regulations, \"are necessary\" does not confer any unlimited discretion on the Government. The discretion, if any, conferred upon the State Government to make substantial modifications in the draft development plan is not unfettered. There is nothing like absolute or unfettered discretion and at any rate in the case of statutory powers. \t\t\t\t\t [Para 32]"
