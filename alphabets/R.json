To attract applicability of Article 20(2) there must be a second prosecution and punishment for the same offence for which the accused has been prosecuted and punished previously. A subsequent trial or a prosecution and punishment are not barred if the ingredients of the two offences are distinct.  [Para 8]\n\nThe rule against double jeopardy is stated in the maxim nemo debet bis vexari pro una et eadem causa. It is a significant basic rule of Criminal Law that no man shall be put in jeopardy twice for one and the same offence. The rule provides foundation for the pleas of autrefois acquit and autrefois convict. The manifestation of this rule is to be found contained in S.26 of the General Clauses Act, 1897, S.300 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and S.71 of the Indian Penal Code.\t\t [Para 9]\n\nThe gist of the offence under S.5 is the commission of an act, which amounts to glorification of Sati. It is the Commission of act by itself, which is made punishable on account of the same having been declared and defined as an offence by S.5 of the Ordinance/Act. The gist of the offence under S.6 of the Ordinance/Act is the contravention of the prohibitory order issued by the Collector and District Magistrate. Section 5 punishes the glorification of Sati. Section 6 punishes the contravention of prohibitory order issued by the Collector and District Magistrate, which is a punishment for the defiance of the lawful authority of the State to enforce law and order in the society. What is punished under Section 5 is the criminal intention for glorification of sati; what is punishable under Section 6 is the criminal intention to violate or defy the prohibitory order issued by the lawful authority. It cannot be said that the ingredients of the offences contemplated by S.5 and S.6(3) are the same or that they necessarily and in all cases overlap or that prosecution and punishment for the offences under Ss.5 and 6(3) - both are violative of Article 20(2) of the Constitution or of the rule against double jeopardy.

The State Legislation has enacted the MRTP Act in exercise of its powers under Entries 5 and 18 of List II of Schedule VII, whereas the RFCTLARR Act is enacted by the Parliament in exercise of its legislative powers under Entry 42 of List III of the VIIth Schedule. A complete scheme has been provided under the MRTP Act for attaining the object of planned development. The paramount object of MRTP Act is planning and acquisition of land is incidental, that too for a very limited purpose. A reference to the provisions of Land Acquisition Act, 1894 in some of the provisions of the MRTP Act is made only for determining the compensation and completing the process of acquisition. The MRTP Act and RFCTLARR Act are wholly dissimilar and have different objects.\n\n\tThe reference to the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 in the MRTP Act, having been held to be a reference by incorporation, the provisions of Section 24 of RFCTLARR Act, which is enacted after the repeal of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 cannot be read into the provisions of MRTP Act, specially when the MRTP Act is not yet amended and its provisions do not make a reference to the RFCTLARR Act.\n\n\tEven assuming that the other provisions of the RFCTLARR Act were to apply to the acquisitions under the MRTP Act, it could be gathered from the clear and unambiguous provisions of Section 24 of the RFCTLARR Act, by applying the salutary principles of interpretation that the provisions of Section 24 of the RFCTLARR Act would apply only to the acquisitions 'initiated' under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894. The word 'initiated' has been defined in the Oxford English Dictionary to mean 'cause, process or action to begin'. The proceedings for acquisition under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 commence or begin with the issuance of the Section 4 notification. A reference is also made to the Section 4 notification in the proviso to Section 24 (2) which goes to show that the provisions of Section 24 of the RFCTLARR Act would be applicable only to the acquisitions under the Land Acquisition Act. The heading of the Section which is one of the internal aids of interpretation also shows that the provisions of Section 24 of the RFCTLARR Act would apply only to the proceedings 'initiated' under the Land Acquisition Act, 1894.\n\n\tAlthough the provisions of RFCTLARR Act would not per se apply to the MRTP Act specially when the MRTP Act is not yet amended and continues to make a reference to the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 by incorporation, the provisions of RFCTLARR Act insofar as they relate to determination of compensation will have to be read into the MRTP Act, so as to save some of the provisions of the MRTP Act from the vice of discrimination.\n\n(1973) 1 SCC 500, 2011 ALL SCR 176 Ref. to. \t\t [Para 10,11,12]"

The MRTP Act deals with planning and development, the acquisition of land being incidental for achieving the object of the Act, whereas the Land Acquisition Act and the RFCTLARR Act [i.e. the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013] are enacted with an object of acquiring the land for public purposes and companies, for determination of the compensation and for the rehabilitation and resettlement of the affected. Both the Laws i.e. the MRTP Act and the RFCTLARR Act are wholly dissimilar, they operate in different fields and have different objects.\n\n\tThe State Legislature has enacted the MRTP Act in exercise of its powers under Entries 5 and 18 of List II of Schedule VII, whereas the RFCTLARR Act is enacted by the Parliament in exercise of its legislative powers under Entry 42 of List III of the VIIth Schedule. A complete scheme has been provided under the MRTP Act for attaining the object of planned development. The paramount object of MRTP Act is planning and acquisition of land is incidental, that too for a very limited purpose. A reference to the provisions of Land Acquisition Act, 1894 in some of the provisions of the MRTP Act is made only for determining the compensation and completing the process of acquisition. The MRTP Act and RFCTLARR Act are wholly dissimilar and have different objects.\n\n\tAfter considering the scheme of the two enactments, even if a fractional overlapping is accepted between the two Statutes i.e. the MRTP Act and the RFCTLARR Act, the same is saved by the doctrine of 'incidental overlapping', specially when the Centre and the State have enacted the Laws i.e. the RFCTLARR Act and the MRTP Act respectively, within the legislative competence and both the Acts can coexist and operate with compatibility.\n\nAIR 1970 SC 1771, 2011 ALL SCR 176 Ref. to. \t\t [Para 10]"

In the same Act, proviso to Section 19(7) in the context of limitation for publication of declaration under Section 19(1) and the Explanation to Section 69(2) for working out the market value of the land in the context of delay between preliminary notification under Section 11 and the date of the award, specifically provide that the period or periods during which the acquisition proceedings were held up on account of any stay or injunction by the order of any court be excluded in computing the relevant period. In that view of the matter it can be safely concluded that the Legislature has consciously omitted to extend the period of five years indicated in Section 24(2) even if the proceedings had been delayed on account of an order of stay or injunction granted by a court of law or for any reason.\n\nClearly the Legislature has, in its wisdom, made the period of five years under Section 24(2) of the 2013 Act absolute and unaffected by any delay in the proceedings on account of any order of stay by a court. The plain wordings used by the Legislature are clear and do not create any ambiguity or conflict. In such a situation, the court is not required to depart from the literal rule of interpretation.\n\n(2002) 3 SCC 53 Rel.on.

The law is trite that when the main enactment is clear and unambiguous, a proviso can have no effect so as to exclude from the main enactment by implication what clearly falls within its express terms.\n\nAIR 1959 SC 713 Rel. on.\n\n(2014) 6 SCC 564 Ref. to.

                "description": "Compensation for land owners - Land in rural area - Cl.2 of First Schedule giving discretion to appropriate Govt. to provide for multiplier factor ranging from 1 to 2 based on actual distance of project from urban area - Govt. Notification dt.13/8/2014 pegging maximum multiplier factor only to 1.10 for all land in rural area which are more than 25 kms. away from urban area - Held, arbitrary discriminatory to land owners whose lands are situated at a very long distance i.e. more than 100 kms. from urban area - Notification quashed.\n\nIt is required to be kept in mind that the notifications or rules which are examples of delegated legislation, cannot override the statutory mandate. The subordinate legislation has to supplement and not to supplant the statute. The benefit granted by the statute cannot be nullified by the rules framed thereunder.  Viewed from this angle, perusal of Clause 2 of the First Schedule to the Act of 2013 makes it clear that the same prescribes discretion regarding determination of different slabs of multiplier factors for multiplying the market value of land in rural areas depending upon its distance from urban areas. Neither any discretion nor corresponding guideline is provided for limiting the multiplier factor to a figure below 2 and, as such, the decision of the appropriate Government reflected in the notifications dt.19/3/2014 and dt.13/8/2014 cannot be upheld. The same is bad in law and deserves to be quashed and set aside.\n\nA subordinate legislation which is not backed up by any statutory guideline under the substantive law and opposed to the enforcement of a legal right would not be valid. In this context, if it is accepted that discretion to limit the multiplier factor to any figure between 1 and 2 is delegated to the appropriate Government by the Act of 2013, then such delegation would be arbitrary as well as violative of provisions of Article 14 of the Constitution as there is no corresponding criteria or standard so as to enable the appropriate Government to act within the framework of the statute. There is no guiding principle or policy provided to guide the exercise of such discretion in limiting the multiplier factor in rural area to any figure between 1 and 2. As against this, the guiding principle, as seen from the First Schedule to the Act of 2013, seems to be fixing the schedule or slabs of distances of projects from urban areas wherein different multiplier factors ranging from 1 to 2 can be determined, the minimum being 1 and the maximum being 2. If absolute discretion is held to be conferred on the appropriate Government in fixing the factor, as contended by the State, then the delegation of such power will have to be construed as excessive in nature and ultra vires the provisions of Article 14 of the Constitution because of absence of guiding principle or policy provided in the statute for limiting the multiplier factor below 2.\n\nThis notification dated 13.8.2014 appears to be merely an attempt to show compliance of statutory mandate under the First Schedule which requires the appropriate Government to determine the factor of multiplier in rural areas between 1 to 2 based only on the distance from urban area. Financial implications and financial constraints can not be said to be relevant factor for determining the multiplier factor by which the market value of the land in rural area is required to be multiplied. Thus, extraneous consideration of inadequacy of funds and inviable increase in budgetary cost vitiates the exercise of discretion conferred upon the appropriate Government under the First Schedule to the Act of 2013 and, therefore, the impugned notifications are bad in law as they are product of extraneous considerations.

It is not the case set up that compensation had not been paid to purchasers/owners. The only case set up is that physical possession has not been taken and proceedings of taking over possession have been questioned to take advantage of provisions under S. 24(2) of the Act of 2013. Whereas, averment in the writ petition itself indicates that possession had been taken over in the year 2000 and that unauthorized colonies have come up in the area. Thus, it is clear that possession, if any, is illegal, and in fact, the actual physical possession had been taken, and re-entering in possession in an unauthorized manner can confer no right. There is nothing to doubt that actual physical possession had been taken in 2000. Thus, S. 24(2) is not attracted in the case. \n\tEven otherwise, proviso to S. 24(2) does not recognize a purchaser after S. 4 notification inasmuch as it provides that where an award has been made, and the compensation in respect of a majority of land holdings has not been deposited in the account of the beneficiaries, then, all beneficiaries specified in the notification for acquisition issued under the Act of 1894, shall be entitled to compensation under the provisions of the Act of 2013. The proviso makes it clear that in case of compensation concerning the majority of landholding has not been deposited, then recorded owner(s) at the time of issuance of notification under S. 4 of the Act of 1894 shall have the right to receive the compensation. Purchasers after S. 4 notification have not been given the right to receive the higher compensation under the provisions contained in the act of 2013. Such a person who has purchased after S. 4 notification, as sale deed is void under the Act of 1894, cannot claim rehabilitation and resettlement as per policy envisaged under the Act of 2013, as his land has not been acquired, but he has purchased a property which has already been acquired by the State Government, he cannot claim even higher compensation, as per proviso to S. 24(2) under the Act of 2013. The transaction of sale, effected after S. 4 notification, is void, is ineffective to transfer the land, such incumbents cannot invoke the provisions of S. 24. It would be unfair and profoundly unjust and against the policy of the law to permit such a person to claim resettlement or claim the land back as envisaged under the Act of 2013. When he has not been deprived of his livelihood but is a purchaser under a void transaction. (2017) 6 SCC 751 Overruled, (1975) 2 SCC 232; (1988) 2 SCC 602 Foll. (Paras 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21)"

                "description": "Lapse of acquisition - Acquisition proceedings initiated in terms of Ss.125 to 127 of MRTP Act - S.24(2) of new LA Act not applicable to such proceedings.\n\nTown Planning achieves various social and economic objectives. Town planning is aimed at fulfilling social and economic objectives which go beyond the physical form and arrangement of buildings, streets, parks, utilities and other parts of the urban environment. Town planning is thus essential for efficiency, well-being of all and leads to increase in wealth in the long run. [Para 59]\n\nWhile carrying out the planned development, a balance has to be achieved between the individual rights and larger good of the society. The MRTP Act has its own scheme for achieving such a balance. The MRTP Act has an elaborate methodology of identification and finalization of the need for public amenities and to initiate the process for acquisition of the land for fulfilling the need so determined. The MRTP Act has its checks and balances such as Section 127, which mandates that a private land cannot be placed under reservation indefinitely depriving the owner to put it to full use. An embargo has been placed on the powers of the State by providing a time limit under Section 127 within which lands so identified needs to be acquired. If the acquisition proceedings would lapse in this manner, it would frustrate the rights of the State as contemplated under Section 126 as well as 127 of the Act. Such cause of action will disturb the equilibrium of MRTP Act and cause legal and practical impediments. \t [Para 60]\n\nThus, the position of law in its simplest sense is that schemes of town planning laws such as the MRTP Act, which are complete codes in themselves, cannot be disrupted by adopting different time frames and on default consequences of lapsing of acquisition. Such outside concepts will produce imbalances in the functioning of these enactments.\t [Para 61]\n\nApart from the scheme of the MRTP Act, there is an intrinsic indication in the Section 24(2) of new Act 2013 itself as to why it cannot be made applicable. Section 24(2) is reproduced earlier. This section will apply if the acquisition proceedings are initiated under the Land Acquisition Act. The crucial phrase used in Section 24(2) is \"initiated under the Land Acquisition Act\". The word \"initiated\" has not been defined under the new Act 2013. The phrase \"initiated of Land Acquisition Act\" was not used in the L.A. Act. This phrase has been employed in the new Act 2013 in Section 24. The legislature has deliberately chosen the phrase \"initiated\". Initiation is not mere presentation but consciously putting the process in motion. The dictionary meaning of the word initiation is \"originating\", \"to start\". When the new Act 2013 was enacted, the decision of the Constitution Bench in respect of an enactments dealing with planned development which are complete codes, was holding the field and hold the field even today. The Petitioners sought to advance various arguments as to whether Section 4 could be initiation of proceedings or Section 6 of the Act. The dicta of the Constitution Bench is clear. The Constitution Bench in the Girnar (3)[2011(3) SCC 1.] at more than three places in the report has reiterated that the proceedings under the L.A. Act commence under Section 4 and under the MRTP Act. For the MRTP Act, there is no notification under Section 4 and an application under Section 126(2) is to be in the format laid down under Section 6 of the L.A. Act. Keeping this dicta in mind, the phrase \"initiated under the land acquisition Act\" will have to be construed. Emphasis in Section 24(2) is on which authority under which Act has initiated the proceedings. Therefore, when the legislature used the phrase \"initiated under Land Acquisition Act\" it will not cover acquisition proceedings which originate and are consciously put in motion for acquisition for a planned development under the MRTP Act pursuant to an application under Section 126(2). \t [Para 73]\n\nThus since Section 24(2) of the new Act 2013 provides different time frame and lapsing of acquisition on default, it cannot be applied to the acquisition initiated under Section 125 to 127 of the MRTP Act. The MRTP Act has not undergone any change from its character as a complete code. Section 24(2) of the new Act 2013 will apply only if the acquisition proceedings are \"initiated\" under the Land Acquisition Act, and cannot apply if they are initiated under Section 125 to 127 of the MRTP Act. 2011 ALL SCR 176 Rel. on. \t [Para 76]"

                "description": "Land Acquisition award - Period of limitation - S.25 of LA Act, 2013 applies to awards made u/S.24(1)(a) and period of limitation of 12 months would commence from 1st January, 2014. \n\tIn present case issue is whether two-year period specified under S. 11A of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 will apply even after the repeal of the 1894 Act, or the twelve-month period specified in S.25 of the Act of 2013 will apply for the awards made u/S.24(1)(a) of the 2013 Act?\n\tConsidering object and purpose behind Ss.24 and 26 to 30 of Act of 2013, practical absurdities and anomalies may arise if two-year period for making of an award in terms of S.11A of 1894 Act commencing from date of issue of the declaration is applied to the awards to be made under S.24(1)(a) of the 2013 Act. This would mitigate against underlying legislative intent behind prescription of time for making of an award in respect of saved acquisition proceedings initiated under the repealed 1894 Act, which is two-fold: (i) to give sufficient time to the authorities to determine compensation payable under the 2013 Act; and (ii) to ensure early and expedited payment to the landowners by reducing the period from two years under S.11A of the 1894 Act to twelve months under S.25 of the 2013 Act. In case of declarations issued in January 2012, on application of S. 11A of the 1894 Act, the time to determine compensation under the 2013 Act would vary from a day to a month, and while in cases where the declarations were issued within twelve months of the repeal of the 1894 Act, the landowners would be at a disadvantage as an award beyond the twelve-month period specified in S.25 of the 2013 Act would be valid. In the first set of cases, given the onerous factual and legal exercise involved in determination of compensation and the need to issue notification under S.26(2) of the 2013 Act, publication of the awards would be impractical. Hasty and incorrect awards would be deleterious for the landowners. If the awards are not pronounced, the acquisition proceedings would lapse defeating the legislative intent behind S.24(1)(a) of the 2013 Act to save such proceedings. \n\tA rational approach so as to further the object and purpose of S.24 and 26 to 30 of the 2013 Act is required. It was held that in cases covered by clause (a) to S.24(1) of the 2013 Act, the limitation period for passing/making of an award under S.25 of the 2013 Act would commence from 1st January 2014, that is, the date when the 2013 Act came into force. Awards passed under clause (a) to S.24(1) would be valid if made within twelve months from 1st January 2014. Contention of the land owners, relying upon R.19 of the Right to Fair Compensation and Transparency in Land Acquisition, Rehabilitation and Settlement (Maharashtra) Rules, 2014 for giving a restrictive meaning and excluding S.25 of 2013 Act is misplaced. This Rule states that the formula provided in S.26 to 30 of the 2013 Act would apply where a notification under S.4(i) of the 1894 Act was issued before 31st December 2013, and an award has not been made before the 31st December 2013. The Rule refers to the formula for computation of compensation to be applied under S.24(1)(a) of the 2013 Act, but it does not follow that S.25 which prescribes the limitation for making of an award will not apply. For the reasons stated above, we hold that S.25 of the 2013 Act applies to awards made under S.24(1)(a) of the 2013 Act and the period of limitation of twelve months would commence from 1st January 2014.\t(Paras 19, 20, 21)"

Section 24 is enacted to take care of all such situations with an intention to balance the conflicting interest of the land holders and the State and it has been given overriding effect over all the provisions of the 2013 Act. Section 24 divides all such proceedings in three categories - (A) the proceedings to which all the provisions relating to the determination of compensation under the 2013 Act shall apply, covered by clause (a) of sub-section (1), (B) where the provisions of the 1894 Act relating to the determination of compensation shall apply, as contemplated under clause (b) of sub-section (1), and (C) where the land acquisition proceedings initiated under the 1894 Act shall lapse in entirety in terms of sub-section (2) of Section 24. Categories (A) and (B) are covered by sub-section (1), whereas category (C) is covered by sub-section (2). The provisions of sub-sections (1) and (2) operate in different fields. Sub-section (1) relates to applicability of the provisions of the 2013 Act for determination of compensation, whereas sub-section (2) deals with lapsing of land acquisition proceedings initiated under the 1894 Act. \t [Para 8]\n\nThe provision of clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 24 of the 2013 Act covers the cases where an award under Section 11 of the 1894 Act was made within a period of five years prior to the commencement of the 2013 Act. The object of giving an overriding effect to the provision of sub-section (2) is to exclude the cases where an award under Section 11 of 1894 Act was made within a period of five years prior to the date of commencement of the 2013 Act from lapsing of acquisition. The period of five years or more prior to the commencement of the 2013 Act, specified under sub-section (2) of Section 24 of the 2013 Act, cannot, therefore, be imported or read in clause (b) of sub-section (1). The effect of such reading would be three-fold, viz. (A) lapsing of the entire acquisition proceedings initiated under the 1894 Act upon establishing that the compensation in respect of a majority of land holdings has not been deposited in the account of beneficiaries, (B) the latter part of the proviso making the beneficiaries entitled to the compensation as per the 2013 Act shall become redundant, and (C) the protection provided to save lapsing of acquisition in its entirety shall be lost. \t [Para 9]\n\nThe proviso below sub-section (2) deals with the subject of applicability of the provisions of the 2013 Act relating to the determination of compensation covered by clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 24 therein, subject to the satisfaction of condition that the compensation in respect of a majority of land holdings has not been deposited in the account of the beneficiaries. The proviso has to be read as an exception to the provision of clause (b) in sub-section (1) of Section 24 of the 2013 Act so as to advance the intention of the Legislature to strike the balance of conflicting interest between the land holders and the State, and to award a fair compensation. \t [Para 10]"

In the event of declaration of an award under Section 11 of Act of 1894, five years or more prior to the commencement of the Act of 2013, subject to the conditions that physical possession of the land has not been taken or compensation has not been paid. Whereas, proviso to sub-section (2) deals with holding the claimants entitled to compensation in accordance with the provisions of Act of 2013 in the event of failure of the State or the acquiring body in making payment of compensation to the majority of land holders. The consequences specified in the proviso as well as sub-section (2) are different, whereas, contingencies specified for lapsing under sub-section (2) are also different. In a way, proviso to sub-section (2) deals with a totally different situation which is not contemplated under sub-section (2). Under sub-section (2) of Section 24, even if a single claimant satisfies the requirement i.e. declaring of an award under Section 11 of the Act of 1894, five years or more prior to the commencement of Act of 2013 together with fulfillment of requirement of failure of the acquiring body or the State to take possession of the land or payment of compensation, consequence of lapsing of acquisition shall follow. Whereas, proviso to sub-section (2) deals with cases not of a single individual but cases where majority of the land holders have not been paid compensation or the amount has not been deposited in the account of the beneficiaries and consequences thereof would be entitlement of those claimants to receive compensation in accordance with provisions of the Act of 2013.\n\nThe proviso to sub-section (2) operates in different situations and contingencies and in fact does not subtract or except anything from sub-section (2) of Section 24. It is true that normal function of the proviso is to provide for an exception of something that is outside the ambit of the usual intention of the enactment, or to qualify something enacted therein, which, but for the proviso would be within the purview of such enactment.\n(1985)1 SCC 591, 2013 ALL SCR 34, 1980 AIR (SC) 482 Foll.

Further, it is clear that the impugned circular applies to banking and non-banking institutions alike, as banking and non-banking institutions are often in a joint lenders' forum which jointly lend sums of money to debtors. Such non-banking financial institutions are, therefore, inseparable from banking institutions insofar as the application of the impugned circular is concerned. It is very difficult to segregate the non-banking financial institutions from banks so as to make the circular applicable to them even if it is ultra vires insofar as banks are concerned. For these reasons also, the impugned circular will have to be declared as ultra vires as a whole, and be declared to be of no effect in law. Consequently, all actions taken under the said circular, including actions by which the Insolvency Code has been triggered must fall along with the said circular. As a result, all cases in which debtors have been proceeded against by financial creditors under Section 7 of the Insolvency Code, only because of the operation of the impugned circular will be proceedings which, being faulted at the very inception, are declared to be non-est.\t [Para 45,46]"

The overriding effect extends not only to any other law for the time being in force but also to any instrument having effect by virtue of having such law. The reasons for giving such categoric overriding effect are evident from the objects and reasons given in the Amendment Act. The magnitude of the exploitation of the poor sections of the society, leading to utter destruction of innumerable families was the underlying impetus to bring the NBFCs under strict control. Chapter IIIB of the RBI Act is a complete code in itself. The Companies Act is a prior enactment as the same was enacted in the year 1956, whereas, Chapter IIIB was inserted in the RBI Act (55 of 1963) w.e.f. 1964. Section 45QA was inserted by the Act No. 23 of 1997 w.e.f. 9th January, 1997. Thus, provisions of the RBI Act would prevail over the Companies Act, it being a later enactment. It is a settled proposition of law that a later enactment will override the earlier enactment. Chapter IIIB has been given an overriding effect over all other laws including Companies Act by incorporating Section 45Q with a clear intention to ensure that in a case of NBFC, a scheme under Section 391 of the Companies Act cannot be entertained unless it is in conformity with the provisions of Section 45QA of the RBI Act.

Therefore, the burden was on the railway administration to prove that how it is lost and it was not on account of negligence or misconduct on the part of the railway administration.  In such circumstances, the contention of the learned counsel for the railway administration that Section 103 of the Act read with Rule (3) of the Rules would be applicable appears to be misconceived and the Court is of the considered view that the liability of the railway administration would be governed by the provisions of Section 100 of the Act so far as the loss of luggage is concerned and Rule (3) of the Rules would be inapplicable to the goods which are booked as luggage and not as consignment.\n\nIn the present case though other conditions are printed on the reverse of the ticket that the monetary liability of Railway administration will be determined by the Rules 1990 and the liability of Railway administration for loss, damage, destruction, deterioration or non-delivery shall not exceed Rs.100/- per Kg. for booked luggage unless the value of the consignment has been declared and percentage charge on excess value has been paid, it cannot be said that the appellant would not be entitled to value of the goods which were lost in transit on account of negligence on the part of the servants of the Railway administration. The appellant had produced the bills and those bills showed that the total value of the luggage was Rs.90,061/- only.  The railway administration did not examine any witness to disprove those bills and, therefore, there is no reason for this Court to hold that the value of the goods has not been proved.  Moreover, non-examination of witness by the Railway administration would lead to adverse inference against it under Section 114(g) of the Indian Evidence Act.  Since the railway administration did not examine any witness nor has cross-examined the appellant, it is obvious that the luggage has been lost in transit due to the negligence on the part of servants of the Railway administration.  Held, the appellant is entitled for the value of the goods, i.e. Rs.90,061/- and the Railway administration is liable to pay the same to the appellant.  1988 Mh.L.J. 434 - Rel.on.  [Para 13,15,16]"

                "description": "Loss of luggage - Non-delivery of luggage - It is obvious that luggage was lost in transit - Liability of luggage would be covered by S.100 and not by S.103 - Railway administration is liable to pay the value of the goods.\n\nIn the instant case, there was non-delivery of the luggage to the appellant and, therefore, it is obvious that the luggage was lost in transit.  Therefore, the burden was on the railway administration to prove that how it is lost and it was not on account of negligence or misconduct on the part of the railway administration.  In such circumstances, the contention of the learned counsel for the railway administration that Section 103 of the Act read with Rule (3) of the Rules would be applicable appears to be misconceived and the Court is of the considered view that the liability of the railway administration would be governed by the provisions of Section 100 of the Act so far as the loss of luggage is concerned and Rule (3) of the Rules would be inapplicable to the goods which are booked as luggage and not as consignment.\n\nIn the present case though other conditions are printed on the reverse of the ticket that the monetary liability of Railway administration will be determined by the Rules 1990 and the liability of Railway administration for loss, damage, destruction, deterioration or non-delivery shall not exceed Rs.100/- per Kg. for booked luggage unless the value of the consignment has been declared and percentage charge on excess value has been paid, it cannot be said that the appellant would not be entitled to value of the goods which were lost in transit on account of negligence on the part of the servants of the Railway administration. The appellant had produced the bills and those bills showed that the total value of the luggage was Rs.90,061/- only.  The railway administration did not examine any witness to disprove those bills and, therefore, there is no reason for this Court to hold that the value of the goods has not been proved.  Moreover, non-examination of witness by the Railway administration would lead to adverse inference against it under Section 114(g) of the Indian Evidence Act.  Since the railway administration did not examine any witness nor has cross-examined the appellant, it is obvious that the luggage has been lost in transit due to the negligence on the part of servants of the Railway administration.  Held, the appellant is entitled for the value of the goods, i.e. Rs.90,061/- and the Railway administration is liable to pay the same to the appellant.  1988 Mh.L.J. 434 - Rel.on.  [Para 13,15,16]"

                "description": "Railways Claims Tribunal Act (1987), Ss.13(2), 24 - Transfer of pending cases - Notice u/s.80 of Civil P.C. - Pending suit which is transferred to the Claims Tribunal u/s.24 - Has to be treated and tried by the Claims Tribunal as an application and not as a Civil Suit - Provisions of Railways Act, 1989 and Rules made thereunder are applicable for inquiring into or determining the claims by the Claims Tribunal under the Act, 1987, in view of S.13(2) of the Act - Compliance of provisions of S.80 of Civil P.C. is not necessary before filing an application under S.16 of the Railway Claims Tribunal Act.\n\nA pending suit which is transferred to the Claims Tribunal under Section 24 has to be treated and tried by the Claims Tribunal as an application and not as a civil suit.  It is further clear that the provisions of the Railways Act, 1989 and the Rules made thereunder are applicable for inquiring into or determining the claims by the Claims Tribunal under the Act of 1987, in view of Section 13(2) of the Act.  Similarly, sub-section (1) of Section 18 makes it amply clear that the Railway Claims Tribunal would not be bound by the procedure laid down by the Code of Civil Procedure but shall be guided by the principles of natural justice and shall have powers to regulate its own procedure.  Though sub-section (3) of Section 18 stipulates that the Claims Tribunal may have the same powers as are vested in a Civil Court under the provisions of Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 for the purpose of discharging its function, it cannot be said that the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure would strictly apply to the proceedings pending before the Railway Claims Tribunal.  If a transferred suit is to be treated as an application under Section 24 of the Act of 1987, it would not be possible to hold that the provisions of Section 80 could be made applicable while deciding the application pending before the Railway Claims Tribunal. Though the provisions of Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure are held to be mandatory and though the same could have been attracted to the facts of the instant case had the special civil suit which was filed by the appellant been decided by the Civil Court, it could not be said that they would still apply after the suit was transferred to the Railway Claims Tribunal.  Compliance of provisions of Section 80 of C.P.C. is not necessary before filing an application under Section 16 of the said Railway Claims Tribunal Act.  Though compliance with the provisions of Section 78-B of the Indian Railways Act, 1890, corresponding to Section 106 of the Railways Act, 1989 is mandatory and notice to the Railways would be necessary before institution of a claim before the Claims Tribunal under Section 16 of the Act of 1987, it cannot be said that notice under Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure is also necessary in such a case.  In the instant case, there was compliance with the provisions of Section 78-B of the Railways Act before institution of the proceedings before the Civil Court or Railway Claims Tribunal.  Though it could be said that the compliance of provisions of Section 80 was necessary for instituting a civil suit against the Railways in an ordinary Civil Court, it cannot be said, especially after perusal of the provisions of sections 13(1), 18 and 24 of the Act of 1987, that a notice under Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure was mandatory and non-compliance with the provisions of Section 80(1) dealing with the notice period, should result into dismissal or rejection of the claim.  The aforesaid conclusion is further fortified by the express provisions of Section 24(2)(b) which stipulate that it would be in the discretion of the Claims Tribunal to proceed with the transferred case from any stage or even de novo as it may deem fit.  When the Claims Tribunal has powers under Section 24(2)(b) to enquire in respect of a claim, afresh or de novo after its transfer, it cannot be said that the Claims Tribunal is deciding the civil suit and not as a claim petition filed under Section 16 of the Railway Claims Tribunal Act, 1987.  Thus, looking at the controversy from any angle, it could be said that the Claims Tribunal was not justified in rejecting the claim preferred by the appellant solely on the ground that there was non-compliance with the provisions of Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  The Tribunal should not have rejected the claim application as the provisions of Section 80 of the Code of Civil Procedure were not applicable to the proceedings transferred to the Claims Tribunal and necessary notice under Section 78-B of the Railways Act, 1890 had already been served on the respondents.

The expression 'goods entrusted for carriage' can only be understood as what is actually intended to be carried by the Railways, and not any items of packing or those required for preserving the goods intended to be carried. In the instant case, it were the fish that was intended to be carried by the Railways and not the ice or the packing in which the fish was kept for its proper carriage. Needless to say, no item used for packing or preserving an article under transport, could be, by any logic meant to be sent or carried by the consignor just for the sake of it. Therefore, the weight of the consignment would have to be taken as the weight of the goods entrusted to the Railway Administration and intended by the consignor to be transported by it. In other words, it is the net weight of the consignment and not the gross weight of the consignment, which is required to be considered for the purposes of Rule 3(iii) of the Rules, 1990.  [Para 8]"

The incident occurred at about 18.35 in the evening. A judicial notice has to be taken of the fact that in the city of Mumbai the suburban local trains are always overcrowded. In the present case, the incident has taken place during evening rush hours. It is a fact of life in the city of Mumbai that it is very difficult even to enter the 2nd class compartments of suburban local railway trains at any hour during the course of the day. Especially in morning and evening rush hours the situation is worst and forcing one's entry in a train becomes a daunting task. The situation is not different even on a public holiday. The passengers who normally travel by suburban trains in the city have no choice but to undertake travelling by over-crowded suburban trains only with the object of reaching their respective places of work for earning livelihood. To keep up with the speed with which the city of Mumbai moves, the passengers have no option but to stand near the doors of the compartment as it is impossible to force entry inside the compartments. No purpose is served by waiting for the next train as the situation continues to be the same. There are poles/posts erected by railways near the railway tracks for carrying electric and other cables. A person who stands at the door on the foot board has to survive the enormous pressure exerted by the passengers who are standing inside. There is every possibility that a passenger who is standing at the door may loose his balance due to the pressure of heavy rush. In such a case there is every likelihood that he will be hit by a pole/post standing by the side of Railway track and suffer the inevitable.  However, there may be cases where a passenger is adventurous and though it may be possible to enter the compartment he may choose to hang outside the door on the foot board. When such a person suffers the fate as the deceased in this case has suffered, it is possible to say that he had suffered a self-inflicted injury. But that is not even the case made out by the railway administration in the present case before the Tribunal. No such specific case is made out in written statement. This is a case where the deceased alongwith his wife were travelling by a suburban train to meet their relative at Bhandup. There is more than sufficient evidence on record to show that it was a case of accidental fall from the railway. By no stretch of imagination any negligence can be attributed to the deceased. It does not lie in the mouth of the railway administration to say that as the deceased passenger was standing on the foot board near the door of the compartment, he was negligent. It is an accepted fact in the city of Mumbai that the passengers are forced to stand near the door due to perpetual overcrowding of the suburban trains. There is no option left with the passengers but to do so if they have to reach the place of work in time. \tTherefore, present case will not fall in the category of exception carved out by clause (b) of section 124-A. Court cannot shut eyes to the ground realities of the life in the city of Mumbai.  [Para 10,13]"

Since the provision for compensation in the Railways Act is a beneficial piece of legislation, it should receive a liberal and wider interpretation and not a narrow and technical one.

Constitution of India, Art.38(1).\n\nIn this case, the Supreme Court has narrated the evolution of the doctrine of strict liability (also known as no fault liability), it has surveyed its status across the jurisdictions in the world and has explained how it has been an exception to the general principles of the law of torts that there is no liability without fault.  Thus in cases where principle of strict liability applies, the defendant has to pay damages for injury caused to the plaintiff, even though the defendant may not have been at any fault.  Court has explained how the doctrine is a method for imposing losses on superior risk bearers, by referring to various authorities on the subject of strict liability Court has noted how the principles laid down in Rylands Vs. Fletcher, 1866 LRI Ex 265 have been diluted over the period of time and what has been the recent trend in application of the doctrine of strict liability and it witnessed swing in favour of this principle by referring to Bhopal Gas Tragedy and its decision in M. C. Mehta's case -AIR 1987 SC 1086- and that strict liability is not subject to any exceptions to the rule in Rylands Vs. Fletcher.  The idea that public bodies act not for its own profit but for the benefit of the community and it should not be liable to strict liability is based on misconception.  Strict liability has no element of moral censure.  It is because such public bodies benefit the community that it is unfair to leave the result of a non-negligent accident to lie fortuitously on a particular individual rather than to spread it among the community generally.  In various social welfare statutes in India the principle of strict liability has been provided to give insurance to people against death and injuries, irrespective of fault.  Court re-emphasised need of developing new principles for fixing liability in cases like the present one and the law of strict liability de hors statutory provisions in view of M. C. Mehta's decision.  Law of torts is not stagnant but is growing.  Submission of appellant that there was no fault on the part of railways, or that there was contributory negligence, is based on a total misconception and hence has to be rejected.  Appeal dismissed.  \t\t\t\t [Para 16,17,18,56]"

The claim is based upon knowledge which the claimants may get from the Railways itself in respect of untoward incident occurring within the premises of Railways. The Railway Administration which undertakes hazardous activity of running passenger trains using rail tracks have strict liability towards passengers travelling by train. In a given case, the train may suddenly stop with a jerk and the passengers from the crowded compartments may, as a result of falling down, may fall prey to an untoward incident. In such cases, the Railways cannot be allowed to plead ignorance about occurrence. Liability of Railway Administration for death of passenger due to accident is covered under Chapter XIII of the Railway Acts, 1939. Section 123(c)(2) relates to untoward incident which includes the accidental falling of any passenger from a train carrying passengers. Section 124 lays down principle of strict liability notwithstanding anything contained in any other law.

Hence, no blame can be put at the door of the consignee in not taking the delivery. The consignment was booked on 26th May, 1984, and it reached destination on 29th June, 1984. Obviously, it reached the destination after more than a month. It ought to reach the destination at the most in week's time. The Railway did not tender any evidence about normal time of delivery and also in respect of handling of consignment. It must, therefore, be said that it was Railway administration, who was negligent in handling the consignment. If the goods reached the destination after more than one month they are bound to be damaged in transit being perishable. There is nothing on record to suggest that the consignor was informed of arrival of consignment. The consignee is not supposed to make an enquiry about consignment for weeks together particularly, when the goods are perishable. Therefore, if, after 15 days the consignee did not make enquiry about delivery the blame cannot be put at his door. He is not expected to visit the Office of the Railway for months together to find out if the consignment has arrived. The pleadings show that almost entire consignment was in damaged condition. The damage to the consignment is the result of delay in transit. This is certainly a case of non-delivery. The Railway is squarely liable to make good the loss.  [Para 8]"

                "description": "Acquisition of land - Payment of compensation - Not dependent upon handing over of possession of land - Use of word \"shall\" in S.20H(1) and (2) in contradistinction to use of word \"may\" in S.20 I (1) - Meaning and scope - In view of facts, calling upon petitioner-land owner to evict encroachers on acquired land and to handover vacant possession of land to respondent, corporation public sector undertaking, as condition precedent to payment of compensation - Illegal and impossible because by virtue of legal fiction in S.20E(2), land in question already vested absolutely in Central Govt. free from encumbrances - And petitioner would have no authority to carry out eviction on land in question.\n\nS.20-H and 20-I shows that payment of compensation to the person(s) entitled to is not dependent upon handing over of possession of the land. There is no negative statutory mandate in this regard. As it is, section 20-I which deals with taking over of possession follows section 20-H which deals with deposit of the awarded compensation by the central government with the competent authority and immediate payment of the same by the competent authority to the person(s) entitled thereto. The draftsman has consciously placed the provision dealing with taking over of possession after the provision dealing with deposit and payment of the awarded compensation amount. This is made further clear by the language employed in subsections (1) and (2) of section 20- H on the one hand and the language employed in subsection (1) of section 20-I on the other hand. In the case of the former, after the award is passed, the central government shall deposit the compensation amount with the competent authority before taking possession of the land (emphasis ours) and as soon as the amount is deposited, the competent authority shall pay the same to the person or persons entitled thereto. While no time limit is prescribed what is unmissable is that before taking over possession of the land the central government has to deposit the compensation amount with the competent authority and as soon as the deposit is made, competent authority shall make the payment to the person(s) entitled, clearly indicating an element of urgency. On the other hand a period of sixty days is prescribed for surrender or delivery of possession under sub-section (1) of section 20-I. This is clearly indicative of the fact that payment of compensation is not contingent upon handing over of possession. Besides, use of the word \u2018shall\u2019 while dealing with deposit and payment of the awarded compensation amount under sub-sections (1) and (2) of section 20-H in contra-distinction to the use of the word \u2018may\u2019 while dealing with taking over of possession in terms of sub-section (1) of section 20-I is also indicative of the legislative intent that payment of compensation is independent of taking over possession. (Para 47)\n\nTherefore calling upon the petitioner- land owner to evict the encroachers and to hand over possession of the land in vacant condition thereafter to corporation public sector undertaking for whose benefit land was acquired as a condition precedent to payment of compensation besides being legally unsustainable is also practically not possible because by virtue of the legal fiction under sub-section (2) of section 20-E, the land in question is already vested absolutely in the central government free from all encumbrances and, therefore, petitioner will have no legal authority to carry out eviction on the land in question. Therefore the stand taken by the respondent corporation would not at all be justified being beyond the statutory framework. (Paras 48, 49)\n\nIn the circumstances since the competent authority has failed to discharge his statutory duty / obligation as per mandate of sections 20-H and 20-I of the Act which has caused prejudice to the petitioner-land owner and there has been an inordinate delay in payment of compensation since 06.05.2017 when the award was made and the petitioner is unable to utilize the land in question in any manner after publication of the notification under section 20-E(1) of the Act in view of sub-section (2) thereof as the land stood vested absolutely in the central government free from all encumbrances. Therefore, the petitioner would also be entitled to interest for the delay. (Para 51)"

He had a railway pass to travel but the period of that pass had expired just two days prior to the date of accident.\n\nHeld that since the deceased was already having pass issued in his favour which expired just two days before the day of accident it did not follow that he was not a bonafide passenger in the train.  Once the conclusion is drawn that he was a passenger in the train but with a pass which had expired or remained to be renewed, that does not mean that the dependants of the deceased cannot be held to be entitled to receive the compensation.  It could not be said that he was a trespasser in the train and not a bona fide passenger.  The words, \"bonafide passenger\" and \"trespasser\" are entirely distinct from each other and cannot be assigned the same meaning and therefore, it is obvious that the deceased was not at all a trespasser in the railway train but he was travelling as an employee of the railway administration for attending his duty and the only fault on his part was that he did not get the pass renewed after its expiry and unfortunately the accident occurred just two days after the expiry of the period of the pass.\t\t\t\t\t [Para 11,12,14]\n\nThus the dependants of the deceased are entitled to compensation of Rs.one lac under R.6 of the Railway Accidents (Compensation) Rules (1950).\t [Para 15]"

Sale how made - such transfer, in the case of tangible immoveable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, or in the case of a reversion or other intangible thing, can be made only by a registered instrument.  In the case of tangible immoveable property of a value less than one hundred rupees, such transfer may be made either by a registered instrument or by delivery of the property.  Delivery of tangible immoveable property takes place when the seller places the buyer, or such person as he directs, in possession of the property.  Contract for sale - A contract for the sale of immoveable property is contract that a sale of such property shall take place on terms settled between the parties.  It does not, of itself, create any interest in or charge on such property. It is thus obvious that sale can be made only by a registered instrument.  The Article A Kararnama was not registered and, therefore,the same cannot be admitted in evidence even for collateral purpose, as per Section 49 of the Registration Act.

The corelationship between the levy and the services rendered should be one of general character and not of mathematical exactitude. Further, the broad and general corelationship between the totality of the fee on the one hand and the totality of the expenses of the services on the other, will be sufficient to justify the levy. The levy will not fail only on the ground that the measure of its distribution on the persons or incidence is disproportionate to the actual services rendered by them. The true test being the comprehensive level of the value of the totality of the services set off against the totality of the receipts. The character of the fee is thus established. The vagaries in its distribution amongst the class do not detract from the concept of a fee as such.

                "description": "Unregistered partition deed - Inadmissible in evidence - But - court is not precluded from considering other evidence adduced by party in support - Of the extent of his holding.\n\nThe position of law regarding admissibility of the deed of partition - Exh. 3 - as held by the High Court, in our view, is unassailable. The document did not require registration and having not been registered, was rightly held to be inadmissible. But that is not the end of the matter. The question whether the other evidence available on record on the point is to be considered, arises for consideration. As noted earlier, the High Court brushed aside such evidence holding that the transaction having been reduced to writing it is the only document which can be looked into and if for any legal impediment it cannot be looked into, other evidence for the said purpose also cannot be looked into. In that respect, the contents of the document have to be looked into to see whether by the document the transfer of shares of the parties is effected or the document is only a memorandum of previous partition which is now reduced to writing as evidence of the same. Therefore, though the document was not available to be looked into for want of registration, if the parties have adduced other evidence to prove the extent of their holding, evidence on record was to be considered. In this regard, it is to be kept in mind that the suit is not based on the document- Exh. 3 or for enforcement of any right or claim arising under the document. On a plain reading of the judgment of the lower appellate Court it is clear that the Courts below had not only placed reliance on Exh. 3 but had also taken into consideration the other materials on record in support of the plaintiff's case that his land-holding was less than 5 acres. The High Court was not entitled to disturb the finding of fact recorded by the lower appellate Court on the basis discussed earlier without considering the other relevant evidence available on record.\t\t [Para 9]"

The real question for consideration is whether such an award amounts to creation of or transfer of any fresh rights in movable or immovable properties so as to bring it within the ambit of Section 17 of the Registration Act? A perusal of the award shows that it is simply a case of distribution of assets of the dissolved firm amongst the partners themselves. A partnership firm is not an independent legal entity, the partners are the real owners of the assets of the partnership firm. Actually the firm name is only a compendious name given to the partnership for sake of convenience. The assets of the partnership belong to and are owned by the partners of the firm. So long as partnership continues each partner is interested in all the assets of the partnership firm as each partner is owner of the assets to the extent of his share in the partnership. On dissolution of the partnership firm, accounts are settled amongst the partners and the assets of the partnership are distributed amongst the partners as per their respective shares in the partnership firm. Thus, on dissolution of a partnership firm, the allotment of assets to individual partner is not a case of transfer of any assets of the firm. The assets which hereinbefore belonged to each partner, will after dissolution of the firm stand allotted to the partners individually. There is no transfer or assignment of ownership in any of the assets. This is the legal consequence of distribution of assets on dissolution of a partnership firm. The distribution of assets may be done either by way of an arbitration award or by mutual settlement between the partners themselves. The document which records the settlement in this case is an award which does not require registration under Section 17 of the Registration Act since the document does not transfer or assign interest in any asset.

On the basis of this application, Society has acted upon and then recorded change in the share certificate which now mentions only the name of the applicant. The applicant has accepted that position. The act of relinquishment was in relation to the interest in the immovable property though that occurs due to the transfer of shares. In other words, the applicant has accepted the transfer of interest in the immovable property effected by way of relinquishment by the co-owners. If it is so, it would fall within the definition of Gift of immovable property within the section 122 of Transfer of Property Act. Indeed, expression relinquishment is not defined in the Transfer of Property Act but dictionary meaning thereof is abandonment of right or abatement of right. The concomitant of abandonment or relinquishment of right of one devolves that corresponding right in favour of the other which has the effect of transfer by way of gift within the expansive definition under section 122 of the Transfer of Property Act.

If the settlement confers rights upon the individual, vis-\u00e0-vis on items of immovable property, which, he is not otherwise entitled to, under the relevant law of Succession, a transfer comes into existence, and thereby the deed of settlement becomes liable to be registered.  \t\t\t\t [Para 23]\n\nIt is not uncommon that settlements provide for arrangements, which would materialize at a future date.

                "description": "Purpose of registration - Registration of a document gives notice to the world that such a document has been executed.\n\nThe Registration Act, 1908, was enacted with the intention of providing orderliness, discipline and public notice in regard to transactions relating to immovable property and protection from fraud and forgery of documents of transfer. This is achieved by requiring compulsory registration of certain types of documents and providing for consequences of non-registration. Section 17 of the Registration Act clearly provides that any document (other than testamentary instruments) which purports or operates to create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish whether in present or in future \"any right, title or interest\" whether vested or contingent of the value of Rs.100 and upwards to or in immovable property. Section 49 of the said Act provides that no document required by section 17 to be registered shall, affect any immovable property comprised therein or received as evidence of any transaction affected such property, unless it has been registered. Registration of a document gives notice to the world that such a document has been executed. Registration provides safety and security to transactions relating to immovable property, even if the document is lost or destroyed. It gives publicity and public exposure to documents thereby preventing forgeries and frauds in regard to transactions and execution of documents. Registration provides information to people who may deal with a property, as to the nature and extent of the rights which persons may have, affecting that property. In other words, it enables people to find out whether any particular property with which they are concerned, has been subjected to any legal obligation or liability and who is or are the person/s presently having right, title, and interest in the property. It gives solemnity of form and perpetuate documents which are of legal importance or relevance by recording them, where people may see the record and enquire and ascertain what the particulars are and as far as land is concerned what obligations exist with regard to them. It ensures that every person dealing with immovable property can rely with confidence upon the statements contained in the registers (maintained under the said Act) as a full and complete account of all transactions by which the title to the property may be affected and secure extracts/copies duly certified.

Sub-section (2) of Section 17 creates exceptions to the mandatory requirements of Section 17(1)(b) and (c).  One of the exceptions made in Section 17(2) of the Registration Act 1908,  is  clause (i).  This exception pertains to \"any composition deed.\"  In other words all composition deeds are exempt from the requirement to be registered under that Act.  The Composition Deed in this case was a transaction between the members of the  same family for the mutual benefit of such members.  It is not the appellants' case that the agreements required registration under any other Act.  Furthermore, in this  case the agreements had merged in the  decree of the Court which is also excepted under sub-section 2(vi) of Section 17 of the Registration Act, 1908.\t [Para 31]\n\nThe only property which did not form part of the suit properties were the forty four acres of land at Raisen belonging to AA's son.  Clause (e) in the second agreement did not seek to either create, declare, assign, limit or extinguish either in present or in future, any right title or interest in the property within the meaning of Section 17(l)(b) of the Registration Act.  All that clause (e) of the second agreement expressly did was to clarify a previous deal.  It did not affect any change to any legal rights in the property and merely recited what the existing rights were.  This clause would not therefore serve to take the consent decree dated 25th August, 1993 outside the scope of the exception in Section 17(2)(vi) of the Registration Act, 1908.\t [Para 32]\n\nThe appellants made much of the fact that no leave was obtained from the Courts under Order 22 Rule 10 of the Code to bring VMS on record as an assignee of their rights.  This was an argument which has been raised for the first time before us. The Rule gives an assignee of a party's interest during the pendency of the suit the option to apply for leave to continue the suit and is resorted to by an assignee when the assignee is of the opinion that his interest would be better preserved thereby.  There is no obligation on the assignee to come on record.  Indeed, in Dhurandhar Prasad Singh Vs. Jai Prakash University, (2001)6 SCC 534, this Court has held that the prayer for leave could be made not only to by the assignee but also by the assignor.  The appellants, who were the assignors in this case, were aware that they had assigned their rights and liabilities in the suit properties to VMS.  They did not choose to bring the fact of such assignment on record in the pending suits.  Furthermore, the suits were not being \"continued\" but were being brought to an end as far as the appellants were concerned.  For both these reasons, VMS' choice not to apply for  leave under Order 22 Rule 10 cannot be construed as having been made with any ulterior motive to defraud the appellants.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 34]\n\nThe pleadings of fraud in both the applications of the appellants were in any event grossly inadequate.  Both the Trial Court and the Division Bench have correctly held so.  In fact the basic cause for which the appellants initially came to the Court was a non-payment of amounts as specified under the agreements by VMS.  We concur with the finding of the learned Single Judge that the appellants could execute the decree for the monies due under compromise decree dated 25th August, 1993.  Mere non-payment was certainly not supportive of a ground for setting aside the decree on the basis of an allegation of fraud.\t [Para 35]"

Therefore, the consent decree did not require registration under Section 17 of the Registration Act.  The result would have been otherwise, if in the consent decree the flat was offered to the plaintiff in lieu of the decretal amount in full and final settlement of the suit claim.  In such circumstances, such a decree would surely have required registration before it could be put for execution.

This is achieved by providing for consequences of non-registration. Section 17 clearly provides that any document (other than testamentary instrument) which purports or operates to create declare, assign, limit or extinguish whether in present or in future any right, title or interest whether vested or contingent of the value of Rs.100/- and upwards to in immovable property.-Section 49 provides that no document required by Section 17 to be registered shall affect any immovable property comprised therein or received as evidence of any transaction affecting such property, unless it has been registered. Registration of a document gives notice to the public that such a document has been executed.   [Para 11]\n\nIt is provided under Section 49 that no document required by Section 17 or by any provision of the Transfer of Property Act to be registered shall affect any immovable property comprised therein or be received as evidence of any transaction affecting such property unless it is registered. As per the provision made in the proviso to that section such a document may be received as evidence of any collateral transaction not required to be effected by registered instrument. It has consistently been held by Courts of law that an unregistered document of transfer which is required to be registered and not registered is admissible in evidence to prove the date of entering into the fact of possession of the transferee and to show the character of his possession. Though an unregistered document required to be registered under law is not admissible in evidence to claim any right under it, it would be admissible in evidence for a collateral purpose i.e., for a purpose other than that for which the document was created. It has always been held that a vendee under an unregistered sale deed, who comes into possession under it, though the document is inadmissible in evidence to prove title or any rights under it, it will be admissible in evidence to show the character of possession of the vendee viz., whether it is in his own right or whether it is with permission like that of a lessee or licensee and if he continues in such possession for over the statutory period he acquires title to the property not on account of the unregistered sale deed, but on account of the fact of his having been in possession for over the statutory period in his own right adversely to the real owner. Similarly, if a lessee comes into possession of immovable property under an unregistered lease deed which requires to be registered under law, certainly, it would be admissible in evidence to show the character of his possession, viz., that his possession is that of a lessee and therefore permissive in nature, since a lessor, who parts with physical possession to a lessee, under law is always considered to be in constructive possession through the lessee. Therefore, so long as the possession of the lessee is permissive, he cannot prescribe any title hostile to his lessor. [Para 12]\n\nIt is also well settled that if an unregistered document is sought to be relied on for collateral purpose under proviso to Section 49, the party has to pay the stamp duty and penalty.

[Para 21]\n\nIn this case, it was the case of the appellant that the suit premises was let out only for the particular named officer of the respondent and accordingly, after the same was vacated by the said officer, the respondent was not entitled to allot it to any other employee and was therefore, liable to be evicted which, was an important term forming part of the lease agreement. Therefore, such a Clause, of the Lease Agreement in this case, cannot be looked into even for collateral purposes to come to a conclusion that the respondent was liable to be evicted because of violation of said Clause of the Lease Agreement.

There must be demise of the property in praesenti.  But an agreement for securing another agreement or deed in future would not be such an agreement or document which may require registration.  Clause 8 of agreement did not create any right in praesenti nor there was any immediate demise of the property.  It was only an executory agreement.  The construction of the plinth it seems had yet to start with other facilities and amenities.  On completion, such a certificate was to be obtained from the defendant.  It was thereafter that the possession was to be handed over under the lease agreement which was to be executed between the parties.  The construction was to be strictly in accordance with the directions and specifications of the defendant.  Condition No.9 also contemplated that if the structure was found defective or workmenship was faulty the defendant could refuse to take possession of the premises and the earnest money was liable to be forfeited.  Hence it is evident that no possession, right or title had passed on in praesenti at the time of execution of the agreement, and there were many prior conditions attached thereto.  Such an agreement, has been rightly  held to be only an executory agreement and not an agreement creating rights in the immovable property, hence not compulsorily required to be registered.

In the instant case trial Court had referred to this provision to conclude that as the document in question related to the creation of a right in the immovable property, it could not be looked into for want of registration as required in terms of Section 17 (e) of the Registration Act. Section 49 deals with the effect of non-registration of the documents required to be registered and reads as : \"no document required by Section 17 or by any provision of the Transfer of the Property Act, 1882 to be registered shall - (a) affect any immovable property comprised therein, or (b) confer any power to adopt, or (c) be received as evidence of any transaction affecting such property or conferring such power, unless it has been registered\".\n\n\tThe proviso thereto, however, circumscribes the effect of Section 49 and reads: \"provided that an unregistered document affecting immovable property and required by this Act of Transfer of the Property Act, 1882 to be registered may be received as evidence of a contract in a suit for specific performance under Chapter II of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 or as evidence of any collateral transaction not required to be effected by registered instrument\". Therefore, a reading of Section 17 with the proviso to Section 49 of the Registration Act, 1908 would support the case of the appellants that in a suit for specific performance under the Specific Relief Act, 1963 even an unregistered document affecting the immovable property and otherwise required to be registered under the Registration Act or Transfer of Property Act may be received as evidence of a contract or as evidence of any collateral transaction not required to be effected by a registered instrument. The appellants as the original plaintiffs had filed a suit not only for declaration and permanent injunction but also for the specific performance, compensation and consequential reliefs and therefore in a suit of this nature, the appellants would be entitled to rely on the unregistered document by invoking Section 17 read with the proviso to Section 49 of the Registration Act, 1908. \n\n2010(3) ALL MR 477 (S.C.)

As it is clear from the provisions of law contained in Section 32 of the said Act, which speaks about the competency of the person to present a document for registration, obviously the Rules framed under the said Act cannot travel beyond the scope of the Statute, under which, they are framed.  Apart from being executant himself or a person duly authorised by him or claiming under the same, no other restrictions have been imposed in relation to the entitlement of a person to present a document for registration.  Being so the competency of the person referred to it Rule 44 (1) (c) of the said Rules cannot be related to any factor other than which is specified in Section 32 of the said Act.  The competent person does not mean to be the title holder of the property which is the subject matter of the document presented for registration.   [Para 11]"

If a candidate is desirous of seeking re-evaluation,then it is obligatory for him to apply for photocopies of evaluated or re-evaluated answer books within ten days from declaration of results of the examination concerned. Thereafter, within ten days from the date of receipt of such photocopies, such applicant has to submit application for revaluation. There are time limits imposed upon the examiners as well as the university in the matters of revaluation. This is necessary considering the magnitude of the requests for re evaluation as also the necessity to complete the revaluation process with utmost dispatch. If the time limit set out in clause 1(iv) is disturbed or varied, it is possible that an applicant seeks for copies even on the 89th day after the declaration of results and further within ten days from the receipt thereof insists that his answer papers are re-evaluated. This would, possibly, lead to the collapse of the entire scheme of revaluation. In any case, these are policy matters, which are within competence of academic authorities. The scope of even judicial review by a Constitutional Court in such matters, is very limited.  [Para 8,9]\n\nCircular No. 239 of 2013 and Annexure-A thereto do not infringe upon the right of candidate, or for that matter any person to inspect or obtain photocopies of assessed, evaluated or re-evaluated answer-books within a period of three months from the date of declaration of result. However, if a candidate seeks to avail re evaluation of his answer-books, then such candidate is required to comply with the procedure and time schedules set out in Circular No.239 of 2013 and Annexure-A thereto. Consequently, the directions to 'Correct' clause 1(iv) in Annexure-A to Circular No.239 of 2013, was not warranted. even though the University of Pune may not be in a position to effectively enforce the provisions of transfer contained in clause 3(iii) with regard to photocopies of answer-books obtained under RTI Act, there was no reason to issue any direction for deletion of the said clause by the SCIC in exercise of powers conferred by Section 18 of the RTI Act. The same is position with regard to clause 3(xiii) which provides that University shall not be liable for failure and delay in supplying photocopies of evaluated/re-evaluated answer-books due to any reason beyond the control of the University. The complaint made by respondent No.2 cannot be said to be a complaint which falls within any of the predicates of Section 18 of the RTI Act. If, however, the ominibus clause contained in Section 18(1)(f) of the RTI Act is stretched and the complaint is regarded as one under Section 18 (1) of the RTI Act, there is still no power to be found in Section 18 of the RTI Act, under which the directions for 'deletion/correction' of Circular No.239 of 2013 issued by the Vice Chancellor in exercise of powers conferred upon him by Section 18(8) of the M.U. Act can be issued. The directions issued also cannot relate to the provisions contained in Section 19(8) of the RTI Act, which incidentally concerns the appellate jurisdiction of the SCIC, which it was admittedly not exercising whilst entertaining the complaint made by respondent No.2. Section 19(8) of the RTI Act, in any case empowers the SCIC to require public authority to take any such steps as may be necessary to secure compliance with the provisions of RTI Act, including by making necessary changes to its practices in relation to maintenance, management and destruction of records. Annexure-A to Circular No.239 of 2013 deals with scheme of re-evaluation of answer-books and in that sense has no nexus with the rights of any person to obtain photocopies of answer-books simplicitor by resort to the provisions of RTI Act. Even a constitutional Court after record of conclusion as to unconstitutionality of a legislative or a quasi legislative exercise, would normally strike down the same, but refrain from directing 'deletion/correction'.In such circumstances, the directions issued for 'deletion/correction' are clearly in excess of jurisdiction.

Before the said Committee makes recommendations to the President, the Committee takes into consideration that such person has eminence in public life with wide knowledge and experience in the subject as set out in the Act.  That the recommendee meets the criterion can be assumed from the fact that the recommendation is made by such High Power Committee unless malafides are alleged and found to have some merit.  The appointment of the Central Chief Commissioner and Information Commissioners and the State Chief Information Commissioner and the State Information Commissioners cannot be assailed on the ground that they are not in the opinion of the petitioners or the Court, the persons having eminence in public life with wide knowledge and experience.\n\nThe comparison, without knowing the intricacies of the system and set up, of the appointment of Secretaries in USA with the appointment of Chief Information Commissioner, Information Commissioners, State Chief Information Commissioner and State Information Commissioners under RTI, 2005, is odious.

Sub Clause (b) of Clause 3 of Article 22 of the Constitution makes it clear that clause (1) of Article 22 shall not apply to any person who is arrested or detained under any law providing for preventive detention. Clause (1) of Article 22 of the Constitution of India mandates that no person who is arrested shall be detained in custody without being informed, as soon as may be, of the grounds for such arrest. Even in respect of an arrest other than an arrest under the law providing for preventive detention, the constitutional mandate is only with respect to being informed of the grounds of arrest, only after the arrest. Even that right would not be available to a person who has been preventively detained under an order of preventive detention. Therefore, the rights under the Right to Information Act would not affect Sub Section (1) of Section 7 of the Kerla Anti-Social Activities (Prevention) Act since it is in tune with the constitutional guarantee under Article 22 of the Constitution of India. On the same grounds on which the Supreme Court held in Subhash Popatlal Dave's case that the person sought to be arrested in execution of an order of detention would not be entitled to invoke the provisions of Section 3 of the Right to Information Act in respect of the grounds of detention, the same principles would apply in respect of the order of detention and the documents in support of the grounds of detention.\n\n2012 (7) SCC 533 Rel. on.

The word \"substantial\" has been used only to indicate that even if entire finance and expenditure of institution in not borne by Government still institution will be covered by definition of public authority. The object of the Act is to secure access to information under control of public authorities. The institution, which is being run in accordance with the statutory provisions and receiving finance by State Government substantially is duty bound to divulge the information, as sought, accordance with the provisions of Act, 2005.

Of course, under the RTI Act an applicant is entitled to get copy of the opinions, advices, circulars, orders, etc., but he cannot ask for any information as to why such opinions, advices, circulars, orders, etc. have been passed, especially in matters pertaining to judicial decisions. A judge speaks through his judgments or orders passed by him. If any party feels aggrieved by the order/judgment passed by a judge, the remedy available to such a party is either to challenge the same by way of appeal or by revision or any other legally permissible mode. No litigant can be allowed to seek information as to why and for what reasons the judge had come to a particular decision or conclusion. A judge is not bound to explain later on for what reasons he had come to such a conclusion.   [Para 6]\n\nA judicial officer is entitled to get protection and the object of the same is not to protect malicious or corrupt judges, but to protect the public from the dangers to which the administration of justice would be exposed if the concerned judicial officers were subject to inquiry as to malice, or to litigation with those whom their decisions might offend. If anything is done contrary to this, it would certainly affect the independence of the judiciary. A judge should be free to make independent decisions. [Para 7]"

As a necessary corollary, the power to exempt from the provisions of the Act is not available to the State Government even in case of intelligence and security organizations in respect of the information pertaining to the allegations of corruption and human rights violations. The application of the notification depends upon the nature of information required.\n\nIn this context, in the instant case the first respondent in W.A.No.321 of 2010 has sought for the particulars relating to the number of investigations completed and the number of persons convicted for the years from 2003-2004 to 2007-2008 with the details as to the names of such convicted persons, the post held by them when the act of corruption was done, the charges framed and the recommendations given to the Vigilance Commissioner after investigation.

The investigation might be over but the prosecution of the offender continues and therefore, vital public interest which is available to the prosecution, as such, pertaining to the accused of corruption, thus, would be compromised if the required information, as such, is allowed to be acceded at the request of the petitioner. The apprehension which has been, thus, put-forth by the respondent-authorities, cannot be said to be make-belief and is an actual apprehension and not a mere camouflage to deny the information. The procedure or the methodology involved in the investigation, as such, would also be, thus, exposed and would lead to hampering the prosecution case, if, at this stage, the information is supplied which is of vital public interest and any deviation allowed, would, thus, only lead to the impeding the prosecution of the offenders.

Not being information available to an examining body in its fiduciary relationship, the exemption under section 8(1)(e) is not available to the examining bodies with reference to evaluated answer-books. As no other exemption under section 8 is available in respect of evaluated answer books, the examining bodies will have to permit inspection sought by the examinees.\t\t\t [Para 27]\n\nWhen an examinee seeks 'information' by inspection/certified copies of his answer-books, he knows the contents thereof being the author thereof. When an examinee is permitted to examine an answer-book or obtain a certified copy, the examining body is not really giving him some information which is held by it in trust or confidence, but is only giving him an opportunity to read what he had written at the time of examination or to have a copy of his answers. Therefore, in furnishing the copy of an answer-book, there is no question of breach of confidentiality, privacy, secrecy or trust. The real issue therefore is not in regard to the answer-book but in regard to the marks awarded on evaluation of the answer-book. Even here the total marks given to the examinee in regard to his answer-book are already declared and known to the examinee. What the examinee actually wants to know is the break-up of marks given to him, that is how many marks were given by the examiner to each of his answers so that he can assess how is performance has been evaluated and whether the evaluation is proper as per his hopes and expectations. Therefore, the test for finding out whether the information is exempted or not, is not in regard to the answer book but in regard to the evaluation by the examiner.\t [Para 25]\n\nAn examining body is the 'principal' and the examiner is the agent entrusted with the work, that is, evaluation of answerbooks. Therefore, the examining body is not in the position of a fiduciary with reference to the examiner. On the other hand, when an answer-book is entrusted to the examiner for the purpose of evaluation, for the period the answer-book is in his custody and to the extent of the discharge of his functions relating to evaluation, the examiner is in the position of a fiduciary with reference to the examining body and he is barred from disclosing the contents of the answer-book or the result of evaluation of the answer-book to anyone other than the examining body. Once the examiner has evaluated the answer books, he ceases to have any interest in the evaluation done by him. He does not have any copy-right or proprietary right, or confidentiality right in regard to the evaluation. Therefore it cannot be said that the examining body holds the evaluated answer books in a fiduciary relationship, qua the examiner.\t\t\t [Para 26]"

The RTI Act provides access to all information that is available and existing. This is clear from a combined reading of section 3 and the definitions of 'information' and 'right to information' under clauses (f) and (j) of section 2 of the Act. If a public authority has any information in the form of data or analysed data, or abstracts, or statistics, an applicant may access such information, subject to the exemptions in section 8 of the Act. But where the information sought is not a part of the record of a public authority, and where such information is not required to be maintained under any law or the rules or regulations of the public authority, the Act does not cast an obligation upon the public authority, to collect or collate such nonavailable information and then furnish it to an applicant. A public authority is also not required to furnish information which require drawing of inferences and/or making of assumptions. It is also not required to provide 'advice' or 'opinion' to an applicant, nor required to obtain and furnish any 'opinion' or 'advice' to an applicant. The reference to 'opinion' or 'advice' in the definition of 'information' in section 2(f) of the Act, only refers to such material available in the records of the public authority. Many public authorities have, as a public relation exercise, provide advice, guidance and opinion to the citizens. But that is purely voluntary and should not be confused with any obligation under the RTI Act.\t\t\t\t\t    [Para 35]\n\nIf the 'information' enumerated in clause (b) of section 4(1) of the Act are effectively disseminated (by publications in print and on websites and other effective means), apart from providing transparency and accountability, citizens will be able to access relevant information and avoid unnecessary applications for information under the Act.\t\t\t\t\t    [Para 36]\n\nThe Act should not be allowed to be misused or abused, to become a tool to obstruct the national development and integration, or to destroy the peace, tranquility and harmony among its citizens. Nor should it be converted into a tool of oppression or intimidation of honest officials striving to do their duty. The nation does not want a scenario where 75% of the staff of public authorities spends 75% of their time in collecting and furnishing information to applicants instead of discharging their regular duties. The threat of penalties under the RTI Act and the pressure of the authorities under the RTI Act should not lead to employees of a public authorities prioritising 'information furnishing', at the cost of their normal and regular duties.\t\t\t    [Para 37]"

When such a recommendation is received, the disciplinary authority would conduct the disciplinary proceedings in accordance with law and subject to satisfaction of the requirements of law. It is a 'recommendation' and not a 'mandate' to conduct an enquiry. 'Recommendation' must be seen in contradistinction to 'direction' or 'mandate'. But recommendation itself vests the delinquent Public Information Officer or State Public Information Officer with consequences which are of serious nature and can ultimately produce prejudicial results including misconduct within the relevant service rules and invite minor and/or major penalty. Thus, the principles of natural justice have to be read into the provisions of Section 20(2). It is a settled canon of civil jurisprudence including service jurisprudence that no person be condemned unheard. Directing disciplinary action is an order in the form of recommendation which has far reaching civil consequences. It will not be permissible to take the view that compliance with principles of natural justice is not a condition precedent to passing of a recommendation under Section 20(2). \t\t\t          [Para 21,22]"

If this interpretation is given to Sections 12(6) and 15(6) then the interpretation would effectuate the object of the Act inasmuch as Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners would be able to perform their functions in the Information Commission without being influenced by their political, business, professional or other interests.

Undoubtedly, the appointment of a Governor is made by the President and is terminable by the President, though the President acts in doing so on the advice of Council of Ministers. The President in a sense holds some authority on the Governor. He can call for a report from the Governor if one is not made suo motu by the Governor under Article 356 of the Constitution regarding the situation in a State so as to ascertain whether a situation has arisen in which the Government of a State cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution. But the President does not act as a trustee for the Governor nor does he act to protect the interest of the Governor. In that sense, there is no relationship of a trustee and a beneficiary. There is no duty in the President to act for the benefit of the Governor and the relationship between them cannot be regarded as fiduciary stricto sensu. \n\n In making the report the Governor performs his constitutional obligation, an obligation far higher than an obligation in trust. It therefore cannot be said that the report of the Governor made under Article 356 of the Constitution is an information received by the President in a fiduciary capacity.\n\nEven if it is assumed that the report made by the Governor to the President under Article 356 of the Constitution, is sent in a fiduciary capacity, the exemption available under section 8(1)(e) of the RTI Act would be available only to the recipient of the information (report), i.e. the President. The exemption under clause (e) of sub-clause (1) of section 8 of the RTI Act can be claimed only by the recipient and cannot be claimed by a person who is an author of the information or who gives the information. Clause (e) of subclause (1) of section 8 of the RTI Act says \"information available to the person in fiduciary relationship\". Even if it is assumed that the report is available with the President in a fiduciary relationship, it is he who can claim exemption when a disclosure is sought from him. Clause (e) of sub-clause (1) of section 8 of the RTI Act does not exempt the giver of an information to claim an exemption.  [Para 34,36]"

The provision, thus, does not suffer from the infirmity of providing no criteria resulting in the introduction of the element of arbitrariness or discrimination. The provisions require the persons to be of eminence and with knowledge in the stated fields. Knowledge and experience in these fields normally shall be preceded by a minimum requisite qualification prescribed in that field. For example, knowledge and experience in the field of law would presuppose a person to be a law graduate. Similarly, a person with wide knowledge and experience in the field of science and technology would invariably be expected to be at least a graduate or possess basic qualification in science & technology. The vagueness in the expression 'social service', 'mass media' or 'administration and governance' does create some doubt. But, certainly, this vagueness or doubt does not introduce the element of discrimination in the provision. The persons from these various walks of life are considered eligible for appointment to the post of Chief Information Commissioner and Information Commissioners in the respective Information Commissions. This gives a wide zone of consideration and this alleged vagueness can always be clarified by the appropriate government in exercise of its powers under Section 27 and 28 of the Act, respectively.

Thus, it is held and declared that the expression 'knowledge and experience' appearing in these provisions would mean and include a basic degree in the respective field and the experience gained thereafter. Further, appointments of legally qualified, judicially trained and experienced persons would certainly manifest in more effective serving of the ends of justice as well as ensuring better administration of justice by the Commission. It would render the adjudicatory process which involves critical legal questions and nuances of law, more adherent to justice and shall enhance the public confidence in the working of the Commission.

However, it is worthwhile to note that having a qualification in law is not equivalent to having experience in law and vice-versa. 'Experience in law', thus, is an expression of composite content and would take within its ambit both the requisite qualification in law as well as experience in the field of law. A person may have some experience in the field of law without possessing the requisite qualification. That certainly would not serve the requirement and purpose of the Act of 2005, keeping in view the nature of the functions and duties required to be performed by the Information Commissioners. Experience in absence of basic qualification would certainly be insufficient in its content and would not satisfy the requirements of the said provision. Wide knowledge in a particular field would, by necessary implication, refer to the knowledge relatable to education in such field whereas experience would necessarily relate to the experience attained by doing work in such field. Both must be read together in order to satisfy the requirements of Sections 12(5) of and 15(5) the Act of 2005.    [Para 93,106]"

However then to say that in relation to them any information is sought , it must be sought directly from them and not from Trust would make it impossible for citizens to have access to information in relation to these bodies. That is not intended by Statute nor is Statute enacted to assist anybody much less persons like petitioner trusts to evade disclosure of their affairs and dealings. Petitioner is public trust managing educational institutions, to which State funds although it may be received in name of educational institution. There are varied activities carried out for benefit and interest of public through such Trusts. To hold that whenever such activities are carried out, activities are amenable to RTI Act and if these activities are carried out by distinct bodies under Trust, one can seek information from such bodies but not from parental authority means neither of them would provide information. Therefore to view school and college or educational institution in isolation and separate legal entity and only deal with or approach them would mean that citizens right which is paramount and predominant in this case will be rendered nugatory and cannot be exercised and enforced by them. Information can be sought by approaching both educational institutions and parent entity controlling them or either.

The right to information, which is basically founded on the right to know, is an intrinsic part of the fundamental right to free speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. The said Act was, thus, enacted to consolidate the fundamental right of free speech. A society which adopts openness as a value of overarching significance not only permits its citizens a wide range of freedom of expression, it also goes further in actually opening up the deliberative process of the Government itself to the sunlight of public scrutiny. However, while considering the width and sweep of this right as well as its fundamental importance in a democratic republic, such a right is subject to reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2) of the Constitution.\n\nAIR 1975 SC 865, AIR 1982 SC 149, (1995) 2 SCC 161, (1988) 4 SCC 592, 2005 ALL MR (Cri) 2312 (S.C.), (1997) 4 SCC 306 Rel.on.

This Court is, therefore, of the opinion that Section 7 read with Section 19 provides a complete statutory mechanism to a person who is aggrieved by refusal to receive information. Such person has to get the information by following the aforesaid statutory provisions. The contention that information can be accessed through Section 18 is contrary to the express provision of Section 19 of the Act.

There is no such safeguard in Section 18. Apart from that the procedure under Section 19 is a time bound one but no limit is prescribed under Section 18.

Constitution of India, Arts.19, 21.\n\nFrom a perusal of the above, it is evident that the exemption gets attracted under two circumstances namely, (a) if the information is personal in nature and has no relationship to any public activity or interest, and (b) furnishing of the same would cause unwarranted invasion of privacy of an individual. These exemptions are, however, subject to the opinion that may be formed by the Central or State Public Information Officer or the appellate authority that the larger public interest justifies the disclosure of such information.   [Para 8]\n\nThe right to information is treated as a facet of the fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution of India. That, however, would be in respect of the information which relates to the functioning of the Government and public activity. The information which relates to an individual cannot be compared with, or equated to, the one of public activity. On the other hand, disclosure of the information in relation to an individual, even where it is available with the Government, may amount to invasion of his privacy or right to life which in turn is also referable to Article 21 of the Constitution of India. It is also possible to treat the privilege of an individual not to be compelled to part with any information available with him, as an essential part of the Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India. Even while exercising his right of freedom of speech and expression, an individual can insist that any information relating to him cannot be furnished to others unless it is in the realm of public activity or is required to be furnished under any law, for the time being in force. The 2nd petitioner is not able to state as to how the copies of qualification certificates of the selected candidates have any characteristics of public activity or partake public interest. [Para 10,11]\n\nIt may appear to be enterprising or tempting for any one to have access to every possible information for an individual whether it relates to an individual or not. The freedom of an individual to have access to the information cannot be projected to such an extent as to invade the rights of others. Further, Section 6(2) of the Act cannot be read in isolation, nor can be interpreted to mean that an applicant can seek every information relating to any one. Just as he cannot be compelled to divulge the purpose for which he needs the information, he must respect the right of the other man to keep the facts relating to him, close to his chest, unless compelled by law to disclose the same. It is relevant to mention that even where an individual is placed under obligation to speak, the law can only draw adverse inference from his failure or refusal to speak but cannot go further to invade his privacy or private life.  \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 11]\n\nSection 8 of the Act, on one hand, and the Section 6 of the Act, on the other hand, operate in different and distinct fields. Though Section 6(2) of the Act enables every individual to seek information without disclosing the purpose, the information that can be furnished to him is subject to the restrictions placed under Section 8 of the Act. Therefore, no exception can be taken to the impugned orders.  [Para 12]"

Definition of Public Authority not only defines to mean a body, an authority or any institution of the self Government established or constituted as provided therein to be a public authority but has exhausted itself by including all those bodies which are owned, controlled and substantially financed by the funds of the Government and also non-Governmental organizations which are substantially financed by the funds of the Government. It is nowhere found from the definition that any body, authority or an institution is to be taken as a public authority under Section 2(h) of the Act simply because it is called or taken to be a self Government or a local authority. Definition of Public Authority clearly stipulates that to be called a Public Authority under Section 2(h) of the Act, any body, authority, or an institution of the self Government has to fall within the categories mentioned therein or to meet with the criteria provided therein. If all institutes of self Government or all local bodies were to be taken as Public Authority within the meaning of Section 2(h) of the Act, the legislature would have so provided.

It is thus a public authority as defined under Section 2(h) of the Act. Having thus come to such conclusion, the Court is not required to examine whether such Market Committee could be said to be owned, controlled or substantially financed by the funds of the Government so as to be covered by Section 2(h) of the Act. However, even on such aspect, considering the provisions of the Market Act, it clearly appears that it is neither owned by the Government nor could it be said that it is controlled by the State Government or substantially financed by the Government. Chapter of Control in the Market Act is to ensure that the Market Committee functions in accordance with the provisions of the Act and to achieve the object and purpose of the Act. Thus, regulatory measures are provided to ensure that Market Committee conducts its affairs as required by the Market Act. The Market Committee has to generate its fund, called as 'Market Fund' by levying and collection of market fees and like the State Government, Market Committee is under statutory obligation to provide proportionate funds, as required by the provisions of the Act, to the statutory Board constituted for good object relating to up-liftment of the farmers and for achieving the object and purpose as regards regulating of buying and selling of the agricultural produce. Therefore, it cannot be said that the Market Committee is either controlled by the State Government or in any way, could be said to be substantially financed by the State Government. \t [Para 34]"

Noticing that even the preamble states that the Act is intended to provide the practical regime of right to information in order to promote transparency and accountability in the working of every public authority, it has been held that in terms of Sections 3 and 4, the public authorities are obliged to supply information. Considering the definition of 'public authority' in Section 2(h), it has been laid down that on the basis of the undisputed facts regarding the control and funding of the aided private colleges after the introduction of the Direct Payment Scheme, such an institution falls within the definition of the term 'public authority' notwithstanding whether it may, or not, be 'State' within Article 12 of the Constitution. It was specifically held that the Act is not confined to bodies answering the definition of 'State' under Article 12, which definition primarily governs enforcement of fundamental rights. Holding that the Act is intended at achieving the object of providing an effective framework for effectuating the right to information recognised under Article 19 of the Constitution, it has been held that aided private colleges in the State of Kerala fall within the term 'public authority' in the RTI Act.\n\nIn the instant case, in the backdrop of the facts an aided private college is a body substantially financed by funds provided, directly or indirectly, by the State Government. It is also a body controlled by the State Government in relation to various aspects, predominantly the financial aspect. The huge funding that is extended by the State Government and by the University Grants Commission through the State Government and the Universities are regulated and controlled by the State Government. The Government controls the utility of the huge funds provided by it. Therefore, the finding that an aided private college is a body controlled and substantially financed, directly or indirectly, by funds provided by the Government of Kerala is only to be upheld.\n\n2009 (2) KLT 507, 2009 (3) KLT 1001 Ref. to.

Consequently, in terms of Section 28 of the RTI Act, the Chief Justice of India is empowered to frame rules, which have to be notified in the Official Gazette, to carry out the provisions of the RTI Act.\n\n\tThe Supreme Court of India, which is a 'public authority', would necessarily include the office of the Chief Justice of India and the judges in view of Article 124 of the Constitution. The office of the Chief Justice or for that matter the judges is not separate from the Supreme Court, and is part and parcel of the Supreme Court as a body, authority and institution. The Chief Justice and the Supreme Court are not two distinct and separate 'public authorities', albeit the latter is a 'public authority' and the Chief Justice and the judges together form and constitute the 'public authority', that is, the Supreme Court of India. The interpretation to Section 2(h) cannot be made in derogation of the Constitution. To hold to the contrary would imply that the Chief Justice of India and the Supreme Court of India are two distinct and separate public authorities, and each would have their CPIOs and in terms of sub-section (3) to Section 6 of the RTI Act an application made to the CPIO of the Supreme Court or the Chief Justice would have to be transferred to the other when 'information' is held or the subject matter is more closely connected with the 'functions' of the other. This would lead to anomalies and difficulties as the institution, authority or body is one. The Chief Justice of India is the head of the institution and neither he nor his office is a separate public authority.\n\n\tThis is equally true and would apply to the High Courts in the country as Article 214 states that there shall be a High Court for each State and Article 216 states that every High Court shall consist of a Chief Justice and such other judges as the President of India may from time to time deem it appropriate to appoint.\n\n(2013) 16 SCC 82 Ref. to. \t [Para 12,13,14,15]\n\n\tD. Y. Chandrachud, J. :- Section 2(e)(ii) expressly stipulates that the competent authority means the Chief Justice of India in the case of the Supreme Court and Section 2(e)(iii) stipulates that the competent authority in the case of a high Court is the Chief Justice of that Court. Significantly, Article 124 of the Constitution of India stipulates that there shall be a Supreme Court of India consisting of a Chief Justice of India and other judges. The office of the Chief Justice of India is not distinct from the Supreme Court of India. The Supreme Court is constituted by virtue of the Constitution and consists of judges, of which the Chief Justice is the head. This however, does not mean that the Supreme Court and the Chief Justice are two separate public authorities within the RTI Act. \t [Para 148]"

(For himself, Deepak Gupta J. & CJI) :- Fiduciary relationships, regardless of whether they are formal, informal, voluntary or involuntary, must satisfy the four conditions [as enunciated in RBI Vs. Jayantilal N. Mistry, 2016 ALL SCR 1090] for a relationship to classify as a fiduciary relationship. In each of the four principles, the emphasis is on trust, reliance, the fiduciary's superior power or dominant position and corresponding dependence of the beneficiary on the fiduciary which imposes responsibility on the fiduciary to act in good faith and for the benefit of and to protect the beneficiary and not oneself. Section 8(1)(e) is a legal acceptance that there are ethical or moral relationships or duties in relationships that create rights and obligations, beyond contractual, routine or even special relationships with standard and typical rights and obligations. Contractual or non-fiduciary relationships could require that the party should protect and promote the interest of the other and not cause harm or damage, but the fiduciary relationship casts a positive obligation and demands that the fiduciary should protect the beneficiary and not promote personal self-interest. A fiduciary's loyalty, duties and obligations are stricter than the morals of the market place and it is not honesty alone, but the punctilio of an honour which is the most sensitive standard of behaviour which is applied. Thus, the level of judicial scrutiny in cases of fiduciary relationship is intense as the level of commitment and loyalty expected is higher than non-fiduciary relationships. Fiduciary relationship may arise because of the statute which requires a fiduciary to act selflessly with integrity and fidelity and the other party, that is the beneficiary, depends upon the wisdom and confidence reposed in the fiduciary. A contractual, statutory and possibly all relationships cover a broad field, but a fiduciary relationship could exist, confined to a limited area or an act, as relationships can have several facets. Thus, relationships can be partly fiduciary and partly non-fiduciary with the former being confined to a particular act or action which need not manifest itself in entirety in the interaction and relationship between two parties. What would distinguish non-fiduciary relationship from fiduciary relationship or an act is the requirement of trust reposed, higher standard of good faith and honesty required on the part of the fiduciary with reference to a particular transaction(s) due to moral, personal or statutory responsibility of the fiduciary as compared to the beneficiary, resulting in dependence of the beneficiary. This may arise due to superior knowledge and training of the fiduciary or the position he occupies.\n\n\tOrdinarily the relationship between the Chief Justice and judges would not be that of a fiduciary and a beneficiary. However, it is not an absolute rule/code for in certain situations and acts, fiduciary relationship may arise. Whether or not such a relationship arises in a particular situation would have to be dealt with on the tests and parameters enunciated above.\n\n2016 ALL SCR 1090 Ref. to. \t [Para 34,35]"

(For himself, Deepak Gupta J. & CJI) :- It cannot be doubted and debated that the independence of the judiciary is a matter of ennobled public concern and directly relates to public welfare and would be one of the factors to be taken into account in weighing and applying the public interest test. Thus, when the public interest demands the disclosure of information, judicial independence has to be kept in mind while deciding the question of exercise of discretion. However, we should not be understood to mean that the independence of the judiciary can be achieved only by denial of access to information. Independence in a given case may well demand openness and transparency by furnishing the information. Reference to the principle of judicial independence is not to undermine and avoid accountability which is an aspect we perceive and believe has to be taken into account while examining the public interest in favour of disclosure of information. Judicial independence and accountability go hand in hand as accountability ensures, and is a facet of judicial independence. Further, while applying the proportionality test, the type and nature of the information is a relevant factor. Distinction must be drawn between the final opinion or resolutions passed by the collegium with regard to appointment/elevation and transfer of judges with observations and indicative reasons and the inputs/data or details which the collegium had examined. The rigour of public interest in divulging the input details, data and particulars of the candidate would be different from that of divulging and furnishing details of the output, that is the decision. In the former, public interest test would have to be applied keeping in mind the fiduciary relationship (if it arises), and also the invasion of the right to privacy and breach of the duty of confidentiality owed to the candidate or the information provider, resulting from the furnishing of such details and particulars. The position represents a principled conflict between various factors in favour of disclosure and those in favour of withholding of information. Transparency and openness in judicial appointments juxtaposed with confidentiality of deliberations remain one of the most delicate and complex areas. Clearly, the position is progressive as well as evolving as steps have been taken to make the selection and appointment process more transparent and open. Notably, there has been a change after concerns were expressed on disclosure of the names and the reasons for those who had not been approved. The position will keep forging new paths by taking into consideration the experiences of the past and the aspirations of the future.\n\n\tIt is not possible to answer these questions in absolute terms. In each case, the public interest test would be applied to weigh the scales and on balance determine whether information should be furnished or would be exempt. Therefore, a universal affirmative or negative answer is not possible. However, independence of judiciary is a matter of public interest.\t\t [Para 88]"

Ramana, J.:- The purport of the Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act is to balance privacy with public interest. Under the provision a two steps test could be identified wherein the first step was: (i) whether there is a reasonable expectation of privacy, and (ii) whether on an ultimate balancing analysis, does privacy give way to freedom of expression? It is acknowledged that these two tests are very difficult to be kept separate analytically.\n\n\tFIRST STEP: There are certain factors which needs to be considered before concluding whether there was a reasonable expectation of privacy of the person concerned. These non-exhaustive factors are;\n\n1.\tThe nature of information. \n\n2.\tImpact on private life. \n\n3.\tImproper conduct. \n\n4.\tCriminality \n\n5.\tPlace where the activity occurred or the information was found.\n\n6.\tAttributes of claimants such as being a public figure, a minor etc and their reputation.\n\n7.\tAbsence of consent.\n\n8.\tCircumstances and purposes for which the information came into the hands of the publishers.\n\n9.\tEffect on the claimant.\n\n10.\tIntrusion's nature and purpose.\n\nThese non-exhaustive factors are to be considered in order to come to a conclusion whether the information sought is private or does the persons has a reasonable expectations of privacy. In certain cases we may conclude that there could be certain information which are inherently private and are presumptively protected under the privacy rights. These information include gender, age and sexual preferences etc. These instances need to be kept in mind while assessing the first requirement under the aforesaid test.\n\n\tIf the information is strictly covered under the aforesaid formulation, then the person is exempted from the right to information unless 'the public interest test' requires to trump the same.\n\n\tSECOND STEP: Having ascertained whether the information is private or not, a judge is required to adopt a balancing test to note whether the public interest justifies disclosure of such information under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act. The term 'larger public interest' needs to be understood in light of 'balancing test' which needs to be incorporated to see the appropriateness of disclosure. There are certain basic principles which we need to keep in mind while balancing the rights which are relevant herein. That the right to information and right to privacy are at an equal footing. There is no requirement to take an a priori view that one right trumps other.\n\n\tThe contextual balancing involves 'proportionality test'. The test is to see whether the release of information would be necessary, depends on the information seeker showing the 'pressing social need' or 'compelling requirement for upholding the democratic values'. We can easily conclude that the exemption of public interest as occurring under Section 8(1)(j) requires a balancing test to be adopted. We need to distinguish two separate concepts i.e. \"interest of the public\" and \"something in the public interest.\" Therefore, the material distinction between the aforesaid concepts concern those matters which affect political, moral and material welfare of the public need to be distinguished from those for public entertainment, curiosity or amusement. Under Section 8(1)(j) of the RTI Act, only the former is an exception to the exemption.\n\n2017(5) ALL MR 686 (S.C.) Ref. to. \t [Para 125,127,128,129,130,131]"

                "description": "Fiduciary relationship - Existence - Judges of Supreme Court declaring about their assets - Said information held by CJI in exercise of his official functions as mandated by Resolution of Judges dt. 7.5.1997 - Information not held in fiduciary relationship.\n\n\tDr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J. :- The Chief Justice of India in exercising his official functions in accordance with the 1997 resolution while holding asset information of other judges does not act for and on behalf of other judges of the Supreme Court. There exists no fiduciary relationship between them. The Chief Justice of India is not entrusted with the power to protect and further the interests of individual judges who disclose their assets. The information is required by the mandate of the resolution dated 7 May 1997 passed by all the then sitting judges of the Supreme Court and it cannot be said that such information is being provided in any personal capacity. The Chief Justice of India merely holds the information in accordance with the official functions and not in any fiduciary capacity. The judges of the Supreme Court, including the Chief Justice of India occupy a constitutional office. There exists no set hierarchies between the judges and they enjoy the same judicial powers and immunities. The judges who disclose their assets cannot be said to be vulnerable to and dependent on the Chief Justice of India. In these circumstances, it cannot be held that asset information shared with the Chief Justice of India, by the judges of the Supreme Court, are held by him in a fiduciary capacity, which if revealed, would result in breach of fiduciary duty. Therefore, the argument that the information sought is held in a fiduciary capacity is inapplicable and cannot be used to prevent the information from being made public.\t [Para 204]"

But it is trite to say that the RTI Act satisfies the test of legality (by virtue of being a legislation) and also pursues a legitimate state aim of ensuring, transparency and accountability of government and an informed electorate. By requiring the Information Officer to balance the public interest in disclosure against the privacy harm caused, clause (j) creates a legislatively mandated measure of proportionality to ensure that the harm to the individual's right to privacy is not disproportionate to the aim of securing transparency and accountability. \t [Para 222]"

                "description": "Private information - Balancing between right to privacy and public interest - Analytical approach to be applied by Information Officer, set out.\n\n\tDr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J. :- The requirement to record reasons is a principle of natural justice and a check against the arbitrary exercise of power by judicial and quasi-judicial bodies. In making a determination under clause (j) of clause (1) of Section 8 in a given case, it would not be satisfactory if an Information Officer were merely to record that the privacy interest outweighed the public interest. Something more is required. By providing an analytical framework to address the two interests to be weighed and requiring the Information Officer record detailed reasons within this framework, the arbitrary exercise or discretion of the Information Officer is guarded against. \t [Para 243]\n\n\tOnce the information sought has been identified as \"personal information\" the Information Officer must identify the actual rights being claimed in the individual case. In setting out the substantive content of \"public interest\" and \"privacy\" various facets of these concepts have been set out. In any given case, the Information Officer must identify the precise interests weighing in favour of \"public interest\" disclosure, and those interests weighing in favour of \"privacy\" and non-disclosure. The Information Officer must then examine the justifications for restricting each right and whether they are countenanced under the scheme of RTI Act and in law generally. The ground of confidentiality simpliciter is not a ground to restrict the right to information under the RTI Act or Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. Lastly, the Information Officer must employ the principle of proportionality. As observed by Baroness Hale, both the right to privacy and the right to information are legitimate aims. In applying the principle of proportionality, the Information Officer must ensure that the abridgement of a right is not disproportionate to the legitimate aim sought to be achieved by enforcing the countervailing right. \t [Para 247]"

Public authorities should realize that in an era of transparency, previous practices of unwarranted secrecy have no longer a place. Accountability and prevention of corruption is possible only through transparency. As the examining bodies have not been exempted, and as the examination processes of examining bodies have not been exempted, the examining bodies will have to gear themselves to comply with the provisions of the RTI Act. Additional workload is not a defence. It is, however, necessary to make a distinction in regard to information intended to bring transparency, to improve accountability and to reduce corruption, falling under section 4(1)(b) and (c) and other information which may not have a bearing on accountability or reducing corruption. The competent authorities under the RTI Act will have to maintain a proper balance so that while achieving transparency, the demand for information does not reach unmanageable proportions affecting other public interests, which include efficient operation of public authorities and government, preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information and optimum use of limited fiscal resources.\t [Para 25,26]"

Annual Confidential Reports are essentially performance appraisal by higher officials which along with other things constitute the basis for promotions and other service benefits. It is a settled law that the performance of an employee in an organization is primarily a matter between the employee and the employer and normally those aspects are governed by service rules which fall under the expression 'personal information', the disclosure of which has no relationship to any public activity or public interest. It is a normal rule that the disclosure of such information would cause an unwarranted invasion of privacy of an individual, however once the CPIO/SPIO reaches the conclusion that disclosure of such information is in larger public interest, appropriate order can be passed in this regard.

Such organization can be substantially financed either directly or indirectly by funds provided by the appropriate Government.

The expression 'goods entrusted for carriage' can only be understood as what is actually intended to be carried by the Railways, and not any items of packing or those required for preserving the goods intended to be carried. In the instant case, it were the fish that was intended to be carried by the Railways and not the ice or the packing in which the fish was kept for its proper carriage. Needless to say, no item used for packing or preserving an article under transport, could be, by any logic meant to be sent or carried by the consignor just for the sake of it. Therefore, the weight of the consignment would have to be taken as the weight of the goods entrusted to the Railway Administration and intended by the consignor to be transported by it. In other words, it is the net weight of the consignment and not the gross weight of the consignment, which is required to be considered for the purposes of Rule 3(iii) of the Rules, 1990.  [Para 8]"

                "description": "Compensation for land owners - Land in rural area - Cl.2 of First Schedule giving discretion to appropriate Govt. to provide for multiplier factor ranging from 1 to 2 based on actual distance of project from urban area - Govt. Notification dt.13/8/2014 pegging maximum multiplier factor only to 1.10 for all land in rural area which are more than 25 kms. away from urban area - Held, arbitrary discriminatory to land owners whose lands are situated at a very long distance i.e. more than 100 kms. from urban area - Notification quashed.\n\nIt is required to be kept in mind that the notifications or rules which are examples of delegated legislation, cannot override the statutory mandate. The subordinate legislation has to supplement and not to supplant the statute. The benefit granted by the statute cannot be nullified by the rules framed thereunder.  Viewed from this angle, perusal of Clause 2 of the First Schedule to the Act of 2013 makes it clear that the same prescribes discretion regarding determination of different slabs of multiplier factors for multiplying the market value of land in rural areas depending upon its distance from urban areas. Neither any discretion nor corresponding guideline is provided for limiting the multiplier factor to a figure below 2 and, as such, the decision of the appropriate Government reflected in the notifications dt.19/3/2014 and dt.13/8/2014 cannot be upheld. The same is bad in law and deserves to be quashed and set aside.\n\nA subordinate legislation which is not backed up by any statutory guideline under the substantive law and opposed to the enforcement of a legal right would not be valid. In this context, if it is accepted that discretion to limit the multiplier factor to any figure between 1 and 2 is delegated to the appropriate Government by the Act of 2013, then such delegation would be arbitrary as well as violative of provisions of Article 14 of the Constitution as there is no corresponding criteria or standard so as to enable the appropriate Government to act within the framework of the statute. There is no guiding principle or policy provided to guide the exercise of such discretion in limiting the multiplier factor in rural area to any figure between 1 and 2. As against this, the guiding principle, as seen from the First Schedule to the Act of 2013, seems to be fixing the schedule or slabs of distances of projects from urban areas wherein different multiplier factors ranging from 1 to 2 can be determined, the minimum being 1 and the maximum being 2. If absolute discretion is held to be conferred on the appropriate Government in fixing the factor, as contended by the State, then the delegation of such power will have to be construed as excessive in nature and ultra vires the provisions of Article 14 of the Constitution because of absence of guiding principle or policy provided in the statute for limiting the multiplier factor below 2.\n\nThis notification dated 13.8.2014 appears to be merely an attempt to show compliance of statutory mandate under the First Schedule which requires the appropriate Government to determine the factor of multiplier in rural areas between 1 to 2 based only on the distance from urban area. Financial implications and financial constraints can not be said to be relevant factor for determining the multiplier factor by which the market value of the land in rural area is required to be multiplied. Thus, extraneous consideration of inadequacy of funds and inviable increase in budgetary cost vitiates the exercise of discretion conferred upon the appropriate Government under the First Schedule to the Act of 2013 and, therefore, the impugned notifications are bad in law as they are product of extraneous considerations.

Clause 2.1 of the Scheme provides that the Eligibility Certificate under Part-I of the said Scheme would be issued on the basis of the totality of the documentary evidence produced by the eligible unit in that behalf and it would be issued to be effective from the date of commencement of the commercial production.\n\nThe Industrial Licence which was granted to the Petitioners on 3rd June, 1982 specifically excluded the permission for manufacture of compressors with the imported technology as also to import compressors.  The Petitioners were able to obtain Industrial Licence permitting them to import technology required for the first time on 31st July, 1984, consequent to the deletion of the condition imposed in the Letter of Intent dated 3rd June, 1982.  Apparently, therefore, the permission for manufacture of compressors itself was obtained much after the last dated i.e. 31st March, 1983, before which the initial effective steps were required to be taken in relation to the manufacture of compressors.  On their own admission therefore, the Petitioners have clearly disclosed that they had not taken any initial effective steps in relation to the manufacture of compressors prior to the 31st March, 1983, and, therefore, apparently, in terms of the said Scheme and in particular the clause 4.5 thereof read with the said Resolution dated 29th March, 1984, the petitioners could not have claimed amendment to the Eligibility Certificate or could not have sought to claim incentives under the said Scheme to the project pertaining to the manufacture of compressors and therefore, the rejection of the request for inclusion of the said cost relating to manufacture of compressors in the eligibility certificate was perfectly justified and does not warrant and interference in the writ jurisdiction.\t\t [Para 6,16]"

                "description": "S.9-A of Securities Act of 1992 has overriding effect over Act of 1993 - Property of \"notified person\" under Act of 1992 will stand attached and hence, Special Court and not Debt Recovery Tribunal will have jurisdiction - Act of 1992 is specially meant to deal with scam cases in securities transactions while Act of 1993 is comparatively general in nature pertaining to recovery of debts due to Banks and Financial Institutions.\n\nIn the present case, both the two Acts i.e. the Act of 1992 and the Act of 1993 start with the non-obstante clause. Section 34 of the Act of 1993 starts with non-obstante clause, likewise Section 9-A of the Act of 1992. But incidentally, in this case Section 9-A came subsequently, i.e. it came on 25.1.1994. Therefore, it is a subsequent legislation which will have the over-riding effect over the Act of 1993. But cases might arise where both the enactments have the non-obstante clause then in that case, the proper perspective would be that one has to see the subject and the dominant purpose for which the special enactment was made and in case the dominant purpose is covered by that contingencies, then notwithstanding that the Act might have come at a later point of time still the intention can be ascertained by looking to the objects and reasons. However, so far as the present case is concerned, it is more than clear that Section 9-A of the Act of 1992 was amended on 25.1.1994 whereas the Act of 1993 came in 1993. Therefore, the Act of 1992 as amended to include Section 9-A in 1994 being subsequent legislation will prevail and not the provisions of the Act of 1993. Apart from this, in the present case both the Acts can be read harmoniously. Whatever dues are due to the Banks or the Financial Institutions can be claimed under Section 11(2) of the Act of 1992 which specially empowers that the liabilities can be adjusted out of the securities of the person notified in the manner provided under Section 11(2)(b). Therefore, in the present case, the Bank can certainly make an application before the Special Court under Section 11(2)(b) of the Act of 1992 for discharge of their liabilities against the securities of the notified person.  \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 8,9]"

Held, S.34 provides for overriding effect of RDDBFI Act. There are several Acts which are set out therein, which set out that RDDBFI Act shall be in addition and not in derogation of the various Acts mentioned therein.  The Special Courts Act is not one of such Act.  It is a Special Act in respect of the transactions of securities for the particular period of time.  Secondly, If the person was notified, then as the properties stood attached by operation of law, the jurisdiction stands conferred on the Special Court to exercise the powers of the Civil Court in so far as attached properties are concerned.  RDDBFI Act, on the other hand, deals with claims by banks in respect of the loans advanced.  They operate in two different fields or cover different subjects.  The Special Court is in respect of the Securities and properties attached pursuant to the notification, DRT has jurisdiction to decide all issues pertaining to claims arising from loans.  That would be both as principal or guarantor. The Special Courts Act exercises a jurisdiction in respect of properties of principal or guarantor, dealing in securities and who is notified, in other words a distinct class of loanees.  If a financial institution obtains a certificate under RDDBFI Act and if in execution any property of a notified person is required to be sold in satisfaction of the certificate, then the financial institution will have to move the Special Court for necessary directions which can mean filing claim before the Special Court.  In that event the Special Court as a civil court while disposing of the assets will have to consider the claim as set out in the certificate and accordingly dispose of the application."

The moment action under section 13(4) is taken, security interest is also created in the secured assets. The DRT can obviously consider whether possession of the secured assets is taken in accordance with the NPA Act and the Rules of 2002. This is more so because if the secured creditor is required to approach the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate/District Magistrate, as the case may be, under section 14 of the NPA Act for help to take actual possession, notice is not required to be given to the borrower. He is not required to be heard. Therefore, if the borrower is dispossessed not in accordance with the provisions of the NPA Act and the said Rules, he can make grievance only before the DRT by filing an appeal under section 17 and the DRT can restore the possession if a case is made out. The liability is crystallized. It cannot be adjudicated upon. Section 19 of the NPA Act enables the DRT to award compensation and costs to the borrower in case it finds, while dealing with an application under section 17, that possession of the secured assets was not taken in accordance with the NPA Act and the Rules of 2002. Section 17 covers borrower as well as aggrieved third parties. All grievances relating to measures under section 13(4) not having been taken in accordance with the NPA Act and the rules made thereunder can be raised under section 17(1).

The purpose of one is to provide ameliorative measures for reconstruction of sick companies, and the purpose of the other is to provide for speedy recovery of debts of banks and financial institutions. Both the Acts are \"special\" in this sense. However, with reference to the specific purpose of reconstruction of sick companies, the SICA must be held to be a special law, though it may be considered to be a general law in relation to the recovery of debts. Whereas, the RDDB Act may be considered to be a special law in relation to the recovery of debts and the SICA may be considered to be a general law in this regard. For this purpose we rely on the decision in LIC Vs. Vijay Bahadur (supra). Normally the latter of the two would prevail on the principle that the Legislature was aware that it had enacted the earlier Act and yet chose to enact the subsequent Act with a non-obstante clause. In this case, however, the express intendment of Parliament in the nonobstante clause of the RDDB Act does not permit us to take that view. Though the RDDB Act is the later enactment, sub-section (2) of Section 34 specifically provides that provisions of the Act or the rules thereunder shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, the other laws mentioned therein including SICA.\n\nThe term \"not in derogation\" clearly expresses the intention of Parliament not to detract from or abrogate the provisions of SICA in any way. This, in effect must mean that Parliament intended the proceedings under SICA for reconstruction of a sick company to go on and for that purpose further intended that all other proceedings against the company and its properties should be stayed pending the process of reconstruction. While the term \"proceedings\" under Section 22 did not originally include the RDDB Act, which was not there in existence. Section 22 covers proceedings under the RDDB Act.\n\nThe purpose of the two Acts is entirely different and where actions under the two laws may seem to be in conflict, Parliament has wisely preserved the proceedings under the SICA, by specifically providing for sub-section (2), which lays down that the later Act RDDB shall be in addition to and not in derogation of the SICA. \t\t    [Para 49,50,51]\n\nHence the provisions of SICA, in particular S.22, shall prevail over the provision for the recovery of debts in the RDDB Act. \t\t  [Para 54]"

If the debt is less than Rs.10 lakh, no suit can be filed by the creditor bank in the Tribunal under the provisions of the DRT Act. So, when the jurisdiction of the Tribunal has been referred to in Section 1(4) of the DRT Act, which limits the jurisdiction of the Tribunal to Rs.10 lakh, prima facie, the intention of the legislature is to limit the original jurisdiction of the Tribunal. If any claim is to be made before the Tribunal, the amount must be more than Rs.10 lakh and if the amount is less than Rs.10 lakh, the creditor bank will have to file a suit in a Civil Court. So, one can safely interpret the provisions of Section 1(4) of the DRT Act to the effect that it deals with original jurisdiction of the Tribunal under the provisions of the DRT Act.\n\nIn the instant case, the court is concerned with the challenge to the proceedings initiated under Section 13 of the Act. There is a specific provision in the Act to the effect that the proceedings initiated under the Act cannot be challenged before a Civil Court because the Civil Court has no jurisdiction to entertain any matter arising under the Act and in that event, the concerned debtor has to approach the Tribunal under the provisions of Section 17 of the Act.\n\nThus, the Tribunal would be exercising its appellate jurisdiction when the action initiated under the provisions of Section 13 of the Act is challenged before the Tribunal. There is a difference between the Tribunal's original jurisdiction under the provisions of the DRT Act and the appellate jurisdiction under the Act.\n\nThus, the Debt Recovery Tribunal constituted under the DRT Act has jurisdiction to entertain an appeal as per Section 17 of the Act even if the amount involved is less than Rs.10 lakh.

                ],
                "description": "Securitisation application - Jurisdiction of DRT - Situs of mortgaged property is not determinative of territorial jurisdiction of DRT - Jurisdiction of DRT would be decided on basis of principles enshrined in S.19(1) of RDDB Act and not on basis of S.16 of CPC since securitisation application is not a suit.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the DRT would have to be determined on the basis of section 19(1) of the RDDB Act which stipulates that the DRT shall have jurisdiction to entertain the application filed by the Bank / Financial Institution under section 19 where (a) the Defendant, or where there are more than one, any of the Defendants, at the time of making the Application, actually and voluntarily reside or carry on business or personally work for gain; or (b) the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises. What is important to note here is that these are the only conditions that are required to be satisfied for the concerned DRT to be invested with territorial jurisdiction to entertain an Application filed by the Bank or Financial Institution for recovery of its dues. There is no condition in section 19(1) that in case the Bank is suing for enforcement of mortgage, the Application has to be filed within the jurisdiction of the DRT where the mortgaged property is situated. In other words, the situs of the mortgaged property is not determinative of the territorial jurisdiction of the DRT. This is a distinct departure from the provisions of section 16 of the CPC and to which we shall advert to shortly.\n\nS.16 provides that subject to the pecuniary and other limits prescribed by any law, suits relating to immovable and movable property and of the kinds mentioned in clauses (a) to (f) of section 16, shall be instituted in the Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the property situated. In other words, section 16 of the CPC stipulates that suits of the nature described in clauses (a) to (f) thereof have to be instituted in the Court within the local limits of whose jurisdiction the property is situated. Ordinarily, if a Suit is filed for foreclosure, sale or redemption of a mortgage or charge upon immovable property [section 16(c)], the same would have to be filed where the mortgaged property was situated. In contrast, we do not find any such provision / stipulation in section 19(1) of the RDDB Act. If a Bank/Financial Institution has to recover its dues either by enforcement of its security (immoveable or movable or both) or otherwise, it has to approach the DRT under section 19 of the RDDB Act. In such a case, the jurisdiction of the DRT is determined as per section 19(1) of the RDDB Act. In such a scenario, even though the mortgaged property may be situated outside the jurisdiction of the DRT, the same could be entertained by the DRT provided the jurisdictional requirements as set out in section 19(1) are satisfied. In other words, even though, the mortgaged property maybe situate outside its jurisdiction, the only condition that would be required to be satisfied to invest the DRT with territorial jurisdiction would be where (a) the Defendant, or where there are more than one, any of the Defendants, at the time of making the Application, actually and/or voluntarily reside or carrying on business or personally work for gain; or (b) the cause of action, wholly or in part, arises. For the DRT to entertain an Original Application filed by the Bank or Financial Institution under section 19 of the RDDB Act, the provisions of section 16 of the CPC would be wholly inapplicable.\n\nIt is these actions of the secured creditor that are challenged by any person aggrieved (including a borrower) under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act. In other words, the Securitization Application is made to a tribunal with limited jurisdiction to decide whether the measures taken under Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act are valid or otherwise. In a Securitization Application, there is no real adjudication of the debt owed by the borrower to the secured creditor and DRT does not pass any decree whilst deciding a Securitization Application filed under Section 17 of the SARFAESI Act. Looking to the nature of the Application filed under Section 17, we do not think that the Securitization Application can be equated with a \"suit\" as understood under the provisions of the CPC.\n\nWhilst enacting the SARFAESI Act, when the Legislature wanted the jurisdiction of a particular authority to be decided on the basis of the situs of the property, it is specifically did so. This would be clear from the provisions of section 14 of the SARFAESI Act which categorically stipulates that where the possession of any secured asset is required to be taken by the secured creditor, or if any secured asset is required to be sold or transferred by the secured creditor under the provisions of the SARFAESI Act, the secured creditor may, for the purpose of taking possession or control of any such secured asset, request in writing the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate or the District Magistrate, as the case may be, within whose jurisdiction any such secured asset may be situated or found. Despite the fact that the Legislature specifically empowered the concerned Magistrate to pass orders under section 14 of the SARFAESI Act in relation to a secured property situate within his jurisdiction, No such stipulation found in any other provision, either in the SARFAESI Act or the RDDB Act. This would clearly indicate that where the Legislature decided to circumscribe territorial jurisdiction on the basis of situs of the property, it is specifically did so.\n\nFurther, considering the fact that the Legislature decided that all Applications filed under section 17(1) of the SARFAESI Act can be entertained only by the DRT (being a pre-existing tribunal established under the provisions of the RDDB Act), would also persuade us in taking the view that its jurisdiction ought to be decided on the basis of the principles enshrined in section 19(1) of the RDDB Act and not on the basis of section 16 of the CPC.\n\nMoreover, Securitization Notice issued under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act, takes within its sweep secured immovable properties situated at different places. For example to secure the loans taken by a single borrower from the Bank/Financial Institution, multiple immovable properties (one situate in Mumbai and the other in Pune) could be mortgaged to secure the Banks dues. If that borrower defaults in payments of its dues, under the provisions of section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act, the borrower can be called upon to pay his dues failing which the Bank would be entitled to take measures as contemplated under Section 13(4) thereof against all the secured assets. In such a scenario, as per the provisions of Section 16 of the CPC, challenge to the aforesaid measures would have to filed in two different DRTs and there is every possibility of conflicting decisions being rendered on the measures initiated on the basis of the very same notice issued under section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act.\n\nThe DRT whilst deciding whether it has territorial jurisdiction to entertain a Securitisation Application filed under section 17 of the SARFAESI Act would be guided by the principles enshrined in section 19(1) of the RDDB Act and not by section 16 of the Code of Civil Procedure.

The loan was advanced to enable the second defendant to fulfil the terms of a contract it had entered into with APTRANSCO.  The second defendant had sub-contracted a part of the work to the plaintiff.  The first defendant had advanced monies to the second defendant for the work and the plaintiff had prima facie secured the loan by hypothecation and a charge.  An order has been claimed against the plaintiff before the Debts Recovery Tribunal in enforcement of its rights by the first defendant.  The Division Bench did not ask itself the question whether it was open to it on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, to issue an order of injunction restraining one of the contracting parties from enforcing as against the other contracting party, the obligations arising out of that contract.  The Division Bench also did not ask itself the question whether the plaintiff had made out a prima facie case for the grant of what it called an interim mandatory injunction --- though it appears to us to be a case of prohibitory injunction --- and whether the balance of convenience is in favour of the grant of an interim order of injunction.  It is not a fit case for exercise of discretion by the court to grant any interim injunction as sought for by the plaintiff. Also to pass an interim order of injunction restraining the enforcement of any order that may be passed by the Debts Recovery Tribunal improper.  The Debts Recovery Tribunal is a special forum created by a special enactment for the purpose of enforcement of special types of claims arising in favour of financial institutions.  Thus, competent proceedings are instituted before such a Tribunal by a financial institution seeking to enforce its claimed rights.  Whatever defences the plaintiff herein may have against the claims of the first defendant before the Debts Recovery Tribunal, have to be put forward by the plaintiff before the Debts Recovery Tribunal.  The mere fact that the plaintiff chose to rush to the Civil Court on receipt of a notice from the first defendant in an attempt to thwart the enforcement of the obligations it has allegedly incurred, does not justify the grant of an interim order of injunction restraining the enforcement of the rights arising out of an alleged hypothecation and a charge created by the plaintiff in favour of the first defendant.  That apart, to grant an injunction restraining the enforcement of orders passed by the Tribunal having jurisdiction to pass such orders cannot normally be granted unless it is a case of fraud or the existence of some such vitiating factor is established or prima facie made out. Appeal allowed setting aside order of Division Bench and restoring order of single Judge dismissing application for interim injunction.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     [Para 5,6,7,8]"

If the relevant special statute provides for the specific period of limitation to prefer appeal without any specific provision for the court to condone delay, then inherent power of the court to condone delay under the general law i.e. Limitation Act , 1963 can not apply and delay can not be condoned on the ground of equity and hardship.

R.5A.\n\n\tReview petitions are dealt with in Section 22(2)(e) read with Rule 5A of the Rules. Section 24, which applies the provisions of the Limitation Act to applications made to a Tribunal, would, as per the definition section contained in Section 2(b), apply only to applications that are made under Section 19, which are original applications to recover debts that are made by banks and financial institutions. What is clear is that an application for review cannot possibly be said to be an application filed under Section 19 even on a cursory reading of the provisions of the Act, as it traces its origin to Section 22(2)(e) read with Rule 5A of the Rules. \n\n\tAn appeal under Section 30(1) is an appeal to the Tribunal against orders of the Recovery Officer made under the Act. The reason why Rule 2(c) of the Rules defines application as including an application under Section 31A and an appeal filed under Section 31 of the Act, apart from applications filed under Section 19, is because under Rule 4 of the Rules, the procedure for filing such applications/appeal is under Forms I to III appended to the Rules. What is important to note is that even this extended definition, under the Rules, does not include an application for review filed under Rule 5A of the Rules. In point of fact, Rule 7 makes it abundantly clear that each such application, including applications for review, are viewed separately and independently, as fees payable for filing such applications are vastly different, as is clear from Rule 7(2).\n\n\tThe peremptory language of Rule 5A would also make it clear that beyond 30 days there is no power to condone delay. Rule 5A was added in 1997 with a longer period within which to file a review petition, namely, 60 days. This period was cut down, by amendment, with effect from 04.11.2016, to 30 days. From this two things are clear: one, whether in the original or unamended provision, there is no separate power to condone delay, as is contained in Section 20(3) of the Act; and second, that the period of 60 days was considered too long and cut down to 30 days thereby evincing an intention that review petitions, if they are to be filed, should be within a shorter period of limitation - otherwise they would not be maintainable.\n\n2017 ALL SCR 2366 Foll.\t(Paras 6, 9, 10, 12, 14)"

We are of the view that the manner in which the sale process was conducted is anything but fair. The Receivers have cast aside every norm of prudence. They failed to act in a transparent manner and elevated a private preference to an overriding priority. As a result, the necessity of selling property at a public auction at which the best possible price could be realised has been an unfortunate casualty. The sale has been conducted evidently without following any principles of transparency or fair dealing. Admittedly no public notice has been issued before the sale which culminated in favour of the First and Second Respondents was held. The price which was offered by the First and Second Respondents was Rs.2.50 crores. The sale was confirmed on 27 October 2006 and it is a matter of some significance that within a period of a little over a month thereafter, an offer was made to the Recovery Officer for the same property for Rs.6.45 crores. Even that offer, it must be noted, was without a public advertisement being issued and an opportunity being granted to the public at large to bid for the property. The amount of Rs.6.45 crores was deposited by the bidder, who had submitted a bid on 5 December 2006. That bid was, however, withdrawn as a result of the fact that the process of conducting a fresh auction came to be stalled as a result of the order of stay passed by the DRAT. The bid amount was permitted to be withdrawn under orders of the Court, specifically in view of the fact that as a result of the delay that had taken place in the conduct of the fresh auction, the process had been brought to a stand still. Significantly, the Recovery Officer after confirming the sale on 27 October 2006, proceeded to hand over possession of the property on 31 October 2006. On 30 October 2006, the previous day, Central Bank had moved an application for setting aside the confirmation of sale. There has been a material irregularity in the sale which vitiates the sale. The authenticity of the valuation report is another factor that ought to have been weighed by the DRAT, especially in light of the fact that higher offers were received days after the sale. In light of all the above, the conclusion of the DRAT that there was no material irregularity is specious. A case for interference under the jurisdiction of this Court is made out.  [Para 21,22]"

[Para 8,11]\n\nThe counter claim is substantially a cross-suit.  The position of a party setting up a counter claim is that of plaintiff.  The plaintiff in the original suit becomes the defendant who is required to file a written statement in answer to the counter-claim of the defendant.  Therefore, the original claim and counter claim are to be regarded as a unified proceeding.  Under the circumstances, the original, claim and the counter-claim are required to be disposed of simultaneously by one forum.  The same meaning emanates from Order 8 Rule 6A (2) of Code of Civil Procedure.  When this Rule is taken into consideration with reference to its true spirit, both the claims require treatment by a single judgment.  Therefore, the counter claim cannot be divorced from the original claim.  Moreover, segregation would certainly cause hardship and inconvenience to both the parties and their witnesses.  [Para 8]\n\nThere is amendment in Section 19 of the Act, 1993.  The counter claims are also brought within the ambit of Debt Recovery Tribunal.  This amendment came into force w.e.f. 17th of Jan.,2000.  If regard is had to the recent amendment, there is no manner of doubt that the counter claim is also brought within the ambit of Debt Recovery Tribunal.  Under the circumstances, the counter claim cannot be segregated from the original suit. [Para 11]"

In ascertaining  the question whether any particular claim of any bank or financial institution would come within the purview of the Tribunal created under the Act, it is imperative that the entire averments made by the plaintiff in the plaint have to be looked into and then find out whether notwithstanding the specially created Tribunal having been constituted, the averments are such that it is possible to hold that the jurisdiction of such Tribunal is ousted. The claim in question made by the plaintiff is essentially one for recovery of a debt due to it from the defendants and, therefore, it is the Tribunal which has the exclusive jurisdiction to decide the dispute and not the ordinary civil Court. In this view of the matter the High Court was in error to hold that the dispute in question is not entertainable by the Tribunal under Section 17 of the Act."

Parliament, however, has in its wisdom conferred a wholesome power upon the Appellate Tribunal to reduce the amount to be deposited under the section. The exercise of that power is a judicial power which is further structured by the requirement that reasons have to be recorded in writing for reducing the amount to be deposited to less than 75% of the debt as determined by the Tribunal. In considering as to whether a waiver should be granted, both the elements of a prima facie case and the question of financial hardship would have to be considered by the Appellate Tribunal. Where as in the present case, the Appellant does not plead financial hardship that is a relevant consideration which has to be taken into consideration and placed in the balance by the Appellate Tribunal. But that is not dispositive of the jurisdiction of the Appellate Tribunal. The Appellate Tribunal in its appellate jurisdiction is required to evaluate as to whether a prima facie case has been made out for the grant of waiver.  [Para 6]\n\nAt the stage when it considers an application for dispensing with the condition of deposit, the Appellate Tribunal is not expected to render a final finding on the merits of the contentions urged in regard to the judgment of the Tribunal. That has to await the final determination of the appeal. But, it is a well settled principle of law that even at that stage, the question as to whether a prima facie case has been made out has to be evaluated by the Appellate Tribunal.  [Para 6]"

Constitution of India, Art.226.\n\nIt is an admitted fact that loan was advanced by respondent No.1 Bank to the petitioners.  The said fact has been admitted even by the petitioners themselves.  It is also not in dispute that the amount has not been repaid.  The respondent No.1-Bank, therefore, had to approach this Court by instituting a suit which was subsequently transferred to the Debts Recovery Tribunal and an order was passed in favour of the Bank directing the petitioners to pay the amount to the first respondent.  In spite of the order, the amount was not paid by the petitioners to the Bank and thus the petitioners were defaulters.  Obviously, therefore, the proceedings were initiated against them for the recovery of the amount and accordingly a certificate was issued by respondent No.2, Special Recovery Officer, in accordance with the provisions of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act and the Rules made thereunder.  It is, therefore, not open to the petitioners to contend that no proceedings could have been initiated by respondent Nos.1 and 2 and those actions were illegal, ultra vires or without jurisdiction.  Since there was an agreement or settlement between the parties and as per such settlement, payment was not made, consequential actions could be taken and no objection can be raised against them.\n\nAs already stated hereinabove, an offer was made by the petitioners for one time settlement.  The officers of the first respondent-Bank considered the said proposal and offer and it was agreed by and between the parties and one time settlement had been arrived at under which the petitioners were to pay total amount of Rs.85,000/-.  It is the case of the petitioners themselves that they had agreed to such settlement.  Moreover, the settlement arrived at had been acted upon in part and the first respondent had paid an amount of Rs.35,00,000/- by a pay order.  The remaining amount of Rs.50,00,000/- was to be paid in two instalments of Rs.25,00,000/- each.  Two post dated cheques, of Rs.25,00,000/- each, were drawn on Union Bank of India in favour of respondent No.1 by the petitioners.  Unfortunately, however, they were not honoured and the amount could not be realised.  If, in the light of the above facts, action had been taken, by no stretch of imagination it can be said that there is any illegality in taking appropriate proceedings against the petitioners.  There is, therefore, no substance in the argument of the learned counsel for the petitioners that the proceedings could not have been taken against the petitioners and the property could not have been sold.  In the facts and circumstances of the case, the action of the respondents can neither be held to be illegal, unlawful or without jurisdiction. [Para 14,15]"

Act - No interference, therefore called for in DRT's Order.\n\nRule 11 states that the obstructionist has to adduce evidence to show that he has some interest in the property or that he was possessed of the property on the date of service of notice issued under said schedule. In the present case at hand, it is very clear from the record that the obstructionist was in possession of the property. It appears that the Recovery Officer has lost sight of the scope of investigation, which is to be made by the Recovery Officer. The question whether the obstructionist is owner of the property or whether he could be owner of the property by seeking specific performance of the agreement is not relevant at all in these proceedings.  It was erroneous on the part of the Recovery Officer to come to the conclusion or to even consider that minor had 25% share in the said property and therefore, the said property could not have been sold without permission from the District Court, that there was no NOC from the Society and also under ULC Act and the fact that appellant was not owner of the said property. Instead of deciding this question, it should have been left for the consideration of the competent Civil Court.  Therefore, the entire exercise made by the Recovery Officer was unnecessary and beyond the scope of his power of investigation as contemplated by Rule 11 of II schedule of the Income Tax Act, which is applicable to the proceedings before the Recovery Officer under Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993. The learned Presiding Officer therefore correctly set aside the order of the Recovery Officer. No interference is therefore called for.\t\t   [Para 5]"

Travancore Malabar Estate came to be appointed as an agent of the Court Receiver under an order of The High Court and had expressly assumed the obligation under the terms of the agency executed in the Court to discharge all liabilities whether contractual or otherwise howsoever incurred by them in respect of the business.  These liabilities included liabilities towards workmen, electricity dues and the outstanding due and payable to the revenue by way of taxes.  Under clause 22, the agent assumed the obligation of furnishing a nil liability certificate every month to the Court Receiver in token of having discharged all the outstanding liabilities.  M/s. Travancore Malabar Estate has admittedly failed to discharge its liabilities and to furnish a nil liability certificate as required by the terms of the agency agreement, to the Court Receiver.  The property was custodia legis in pursuance of an order passed by this Court. An unconditional obligation was assumed by the agent by the execution of the agency agreement in pursuance of an order of High Court.  High Court, therefore, clearly has the jurisdiction to hold the agent responsible to perform the agency terms and to hold the agent responsible for a breach.  The report of the Court Receiver has also adverted to the fact that the Constituted Attorney of the agent had undertaken to lodge a nil liability certificate and to ensure that the agent will discharge all the liabilities at the earliest.  In the site report dated 5th December, 2000, which has been signed by the Constituted Attorney of the agent of the Court Receiver, the following statement is contained in that regard :\n\n\"Shri. Yeldo, the Constituted Attorney of M/s. Travancore Malabar Estates being the Agents of the Court Receiver states that at present the Agents i.e. TME have (sic) produced the \"Nil liability certificate\" to the Court Receiver and have not discharged all the liabilities namely all the contractual and statutory liabilities of the suit estate since the office of the estate is closed.  Shri. Yeldo further undertakes on behalf of the aforesaid Agents that they will lodge the \"Nil liability certificate\" and that the Agents shall discharge all the liabilities as per the Agency Agreement in respect of the suit estate at the earliest.  Shri. Yeldo further undertakes that they will deposit the arrears of royalty amounting to Rs.12,24,194/- with the Court Receiver at the earliest.\"\n\nThe site report is signed by the Constituted Attorney of the agent.\n\nIn view of the undertaking which was furnished by the Constituted Attorney on behalf of the agent of the Court Receiver, the undertaking must be made good and can be enforced in proceedings before High Court.

Otherwise, the said provision becomes redundant and otiose. The arguments for the appellant that S.22 of the Act bars the application of C.P.C., excepting those which are enumerated in sub-section (2) thereof, and that power to impound the passport is not the one of such powers enumerated, and therefore, the DRT has got no power to impound a passport cannot be acceded to, as S.22(1) of the Act relieves the DRT from the bondage of rigour of procedure laid down by the Code of Civil Procedure, leaving it to be guided by the Principles of Natural Justice, subject to other provisions of the Act and the Rules, and vests the DRT with such wide powers to regulate its own procedure including the place at which it can have sittings. As such, the powers of DRT have not to be read to have been truncated by S.22(1), and, in fact, it has to be read and understood to have been widened giving a free hand to the Tribunal to pass any such orders, which have got the effect of not only speedy trial, but, effective enforcement of the decree in the event of the same being passed. It cannot be denied that presence of the appellant in the country enables the smooth and speedy disposal of the case before the DRT, and, in the event of the decree being passed and a Certificate is issued under S.19(7) of the Act, the same can be effectively executed.  If there are no grounds to pass the order, impounding passport of debtor certainly, it is arbitrary as it violates not only the fundamental right under Art.21, but also Arts.14 and 19 too. But, the DRT is of the considered view that the security offered is far too meagre as compared to the debt to be realized, and, in that context, it cannot be said that the order of the tribunal is arbitrary.\t\t [Para 10]"

The right to appeal is a statutory right and it can be circumscribed by the conditions in the grant. The object of section 21 apparently is to ensure the deposit of debt due from the appellant in case he seeks to file an appeal against the order made or deemed to have been made by a Tribunal under the Act. All that the statutory provision seeks to do is to regulate the exercise of the right of appeal. The object of the above provision is to keep in balance the right of appeal, which is conferred upon a person who is aggrieved by the order of the Tribunal, directing recovery of the debt due and at the same time protect the right of banking industry, to have speedy recovery of the debt due and also prevent the delay in effecting their recovery. The right of appeal is creature of a statute. Without a statutory provision creating such a right the person aggrieved is not entitled to file an appeal. Considering the object and legislative intent behind section 21, the acceptance of prayer made by the petitioner would result in defeating the legislative intent. At the same time, it would defeat the object of speedy recovery of the amount due from the debtor. In the instant case, the application seeking extention of time to deposit amount was withdrawn on 24th October, 2007 The withdrawal of the said application has resulted in waiver of the right of the applicant to seek extension of time. The dismissal of appeal became final and conclusive. The petitioners have thus, lost their right to comply with the order of pre-deposit. The novel method found out by the petitioners to seek compliance of order of pre-deposit on the face of it, cannot be accepted. At the same time, looking to the stage of litigation and conduct of the petitioners, they are not entitled to seek extension of time to comply with the order of pre- deposit. No case in this behalf is made out by the petitioners. The petition being devoid of any substance is liable to be dismissed.  [Para 23,24,25,27]"

                "description": "Distribution of sale proceeds by Debt Recovery Tribunal - Claim by workmen in respect of their dues - S.19(19) is attracted only where debtor company is in winding up or a provisional liquidator is appointed - Claims of workmen who claim to be entitled to payment pari passu have to be considered by liquidator and not by DRT.\n\nThe law on the point can be summarized thus :-\n\n(i) If the debtor company is not in liquidation nor any provisional liquidator has been appointed and merely winding up proceedings are pending, there is no question of distribution of sale proceeds among secured creditors in the manner prescribed in Section 19(19) of the 1993 Act.\n\n(ii) Where a company is in liquidation, a statutory charge is created in favour of workmen in respect of their dues over the security of every secured creditor and this charge is pari passu with that of the secured creditor. Such statutory charge is to the extent of workmen's portion in relation to the security held by the secured creditor of the debtor company.\n\n(iii) The above position is equally applicable where the assets of the debtor company have been sold in execution of the recovery certificate obtained by the bank or financial institution against the debtor company when it was not in liquidation but before the proceeds realized from such sale could be fully and finally disbursed, the company had gone into liquidation. In other words, pending final disbursement of the proceeds realized from the sale of security in execution of the recovery certificate issued by the debt recovery tribunal, if debtor company becomes company in winding up, Section 529A read with Section 529(1)(c) proviso come into operation and statutory charge is created in favour of workmen in respect of their dues over such proceeds.\n\n(iv) The relevant date for arriving at the ratio at which the sale proceeds are to be distributed amongst workmen and secured creditors of the debtor company is the date of the winding up order and not the date of sale.\n\n(v) The conclusions (ii) to (iv) shall be mutatis mutandis applicable where provisional liquidator has been appointed in respect of the debtor company.\n\n(vi) Where the winding up petition against the debtor company is pending but no order of winding up has been passed nor any provisional liquidator has been appointed in respect of such company at the time of order of sale by DRT and the properties of the debtor company have been sold in execution of the recovery certificate and proceeds of sale realized and full disbursement of the sale proceeds has been made to the concerned bank or financial institution, the subsequent event of the debtor company going into liquidation is no ground for reopening disbursement by the DRT.\n\n(vii) However, before full and final disbursement of sale proceeds, if the debtor company has gone into liquidation and a liquidator is appointed, disbursement of undisbursed proceeds by DRT can only be done after notice to the liquidator and after hearing him. In that situation if there is claim of workmen's dues, the DRT has two options available with it. One, the bank or financial institution which made an application before DRT for recovery of debt from the debtor company may be paid the undisbursed amount against due debt as per the recovery certificate after securing an indemnity bond of restitution of the amount to the extent of workmen's dues as may be finally determined by the liquidator of the debtor company and payable to workmen in the proportion set out in the illustration appended to Section 529(3)(c) of the Companies Act. The other, DRT may set apart tentatively portion of the undisbursed amount towards workmen's dues in the ratio as per the illustration following Section 529(3)(c) and disburse the balance amount to the applicant bank or financial institution subject to an undertaking by such bank or financial institution to restitute the amount to the extent workmen's dues as may be finally determined by the liquidator, falls short of the amount which may be distributable to the workmen as per the above illustration. The amount so set apart may be disbursed to the liquidator towards workmen's dues on ad hoc basis subject to adjustment on final determination of the workmen's dues by the liquidator.\n\n(viii) The first option must be exercised by DRT only in a situation where no application for distribution towards workmen's dues against the debtor company has been made by the liquidator or the workmen before the DRT.\n\n(ix) Where the sale of security has been effected in execution of recovery certificate issued by the DRT under the 1993 Act, the distribution of sale proceeds has to be made by the DRT alone in accordance with Section 529A of the Companies Act and by no other forum or authority.\n\n(x) The workmen of the company in winding up acquire the standing of the secured creditors on and from the date of winding up order (or where provisional liquidator has been appointed, from the date of such appointment) and they become entitled to the distribution of sale proceeds in the ratio as explained in the illustration appended to Section 529(3)(c) of the Companies Act.\n\n(xi) Section 19(19) of the 1993 Act does not clothe DRT with jurisdiction to determine the workmen's claim against the debtor company. The adjudication of workmen's dues against the debtor company in liquidation has to be made by the liquidator. In other words, once the company is in winding up the only competent authority to determine the workmen's dues is the liquidator who obviously has to act under the supervision of the company court and by no other authority. (xii) Section 19 (19) is attracted only where a debtor company is in winding up or a provisional liquidator has been appointed in respect of such company. If the debtor company is not in liquidation or if in respect of such company no order of appointment of provisional liquidator has been made and merely winding up proceedings are pending, the question of distribution of sale proceeds among secured creditors in the manner prescribed in Section19(19) of the 1993 Act does not arise.

The Act has been introduced to provide speedy remedy for recovery of debts. The legislature, therefore, in its wisdom thought it expedient to provide special remedy for recovery of debts. The prime object of the establishment of Debts Recovery Tribunal is to provide expeditious adjudication of recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions, therefore, Section 22 of the RDDB & FI Act has clothed the Tribunal with the power to regulate its own procedure guided by the principles of natural justice and is not bound by the procedure laid down by the Code of Civil Procedure. Hence DRT, Mumbai who has issued recovery certificate can get it executed from his own recovery officer or he can send the copy of certificate to the other DRT, Ahmadabad, for execution within whose jurisdiction the property is situated.\n\nAIR 2010 Gujarat 124 Foll.\t     [Para 14]"

It is not a case where the appellants had prayed for quashing of a policy decision taken by the respondent - Bank. The question which arose for consideration before the Appellate Tribunal as also before the High Court was as to whether offer having been made by the bank to the appellants herein, it could have turned around and contend that only because the appellants had furnished security to the extent of Rs.11 crores, the same by itself would entitle it to take recourse to a discriminatory treatment.

                "description": "Evidence Act (1872), S.41 - Constitution of India, Art.225 - Admiralty jurisdiction of Bombay High Court - Vessels purchased by defendant company after obtaining loan from ICICI - Vessels mortgaged with plaintiff ICICI - Recovery of dues - Suit can be filed in admiralty jurisdiction of Bombay HC - Jurisdiction of HC is not ousted by Act of 1993 and Tribunal under that Act has no jurisdiction in that respect.\n\nUnder admiralty law, a vessel or ship itself is treated as a person and a suit can be instituted only against the vessel against which the plaintiff has a claim and its owner who may not be named.  Thus, under the admiralty law, the ship or vessel itself can be held liable for a claim and it is a peculiar feature of the admiralty jurisdiction that a vessel or ship is treated as a person against which a civil suit can be filed which is capable of being arrested for satisfying the claim of the plaintiff.  When a plaintiff brings an action against a vessel for recovery of his claim, the suit is called as an action in rem and in such a suit, an application is made for arrest of the ship.  Thus, for the purpose of admiralty jurisdiction, the vessel itself is treated as a person from whom an amount is due to the plaintiff.\t\t\t [Para 7]\n\nIn view of S.3(42) of the General Clauses Act a person is a living person as also a company or association or body of individuals can also be treated as person.  Thus, for the purpose of the provisions of the D.R.T. Act 1993, a vessel cannot be treated as a person and therefore, when a financial institution brings an action in rem in the admiralty Court against a vessel, it cannot be said that the claim that Bank or financial institution is making in the admiralty suit in so far as the vessel is concerned, is a debt within the meaning of section 2(g) of the said Act.  Thus, a suit instituted by a Bank or financial institution for recovery of its claim against a vessel in the admiralty jurisdiction of the High Court, cannot be termed as a debt and therefore, the D.R.T.1993 will not have jurisdiction to entertain that suit in terms of the provisions of section 17 of the Act. [Para 7]\n\nIt is to be seen that the present suit has been instituted by the Bank in the High Court pursuant to the jurisdiction conferred on this Court by section 51 of the Merchant Shipping Act which empowers a High Court to entertain a claim by a mortgagee for recovery of his dues by sale of the mortgaged ship.  A vessel or a ship is a movable property, therefore, under the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act, it is incapable of being mortgaged.  Thus, mortgage of a movable property viz. ship is a special feature of the Merchant Shipping Act.\t\t [Para 8]\n\nIt is clear from the perusal of section 2 of the Act 1958 that the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act apply to vessels which are registered in India unless otherwise it is expressly so provided.  Thus, operation of the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act including the provisions of section 51 in relation to a vessel which is registered in India can be curtailed, abridged or modified only by making an express provision for that purpose.  To say that D.R.T. Act 1993 curtails the operation of the provisions of the Merchant Shipping Act including section 51, there has to be an express provision made to that effect in the D.R.T. Act 1993.  The provision found in section 34 of 1993 Act is a general provision, it is not an express provision made for excluding the operation of the Merchant Shipping Act and therefore, the jurisdiction of High Court to entertain the suit would not be ousted because of the provisions of the D.R.T. Act 1993.  [Para 8]\n\nIt is further to be seen here that the admiralty jurisdiction of this Court extends even to the recovery of amounts advanced by the Banks and other financial institutions for purchase of the riggs, which are most of the time installed in the economic zone.  The jurisdiction of the D.R.T. Act, in my opinion, cannot be extended to the economic zone which lies beyond the territorial waters of India.\t\t\t\t [Para 9]\n\nFurther, it is clear from the provisions of Article 225 of the Constitution that the powers and jurisdiction exercised by the High Courts at the commencement of the Constitution are subject only to the provisions of the Constitution and to any law of the appropriate Legislature made by virtue of powers conferred on that Legislature by this Constitution. The exercise of admiralty jurisdiction by this High Court is not definitely contrary to any of the provisions of the Constitution.  The only enquiry that is to be made is whether the provisions of the D.R.T. Act 1993 can be termed as law of the appropriate Legislature made by virtue of powers conferred on that Legislature by this Constitution.  It is to be seen that so far as the subject of admiralty is concerned, by Schedule Seventh, List I Entry 95 of the Constitution, legislative competence has been conferred on the Union Parliament to make law in relation to admiralty jurisdiction.  Therefore, unless and until the Union Parliament, in exercise of its powers under Entry 95, List I of the Seventh Schedule of the Constitution enacts a law, the admiralty jurisdiction of this Court cannot be curtailed.  The D.R.T. Act 1993, by no stretch of imagination, can be termed as a law enacted by the Union Parliament in exercise of its legislative competence under Entry 95 List I of Schedule Seventh of the Constitution and therefore, it cannot be said that the admiralty jurisdiction of this Court which is served by Article 225 of the Constitution of India is taken away by provisions of section 34 of the D.R.T. Act 1993 in so far as the claims of Banks and financial institutions are concerned.\t\t [Para 10]\n\nIt is further to be seen here that section 51 of the Merchant Shipping Act makes a specific provision for recovery of the mortgage money by the mortgagee by sale of the vessel, which is mortgaged.  Perusal of the provisions in Part III of the Rules and Forms of the High Court of Judicature at Bombay on the Original Side, shows that when a person has a claim against a vessel, he can bring in an action in rem and there is a special and effective procedure provided for recovering the claim of the person in such a suit.  It is further to be seen here that the rules provide a special procedure for sale of a ship or vessel pursuant to its arrest.  It provides for determination of various claims that may be lodged against the vessel and distribution of the sale proceeds amount to the claimants, with the result any person who buys a vessel sold in the admiralty jurisdiction gets a clear title and he gets the vessel free from all encumbrances.  By virtue of the provisions of section 41 of the Evidence Act, the sale certificate issued by High Court in favour of the purchaser is a conclusive proof of his title to the ship and any person who may have a claim against that vessel cannot make any claim against the purchaser or the vessel in his hand.  On the contrary, when a vessel would be sold in execution of a certificate issued by the D.R.T. the sale certificate issued by D.R.T. may not confer a clear title on the purchaser.   [Para 11,12]\n\nIt is common ground that the agreement of mortgage as also the agreement of guarantee were entered into at Bombay and the amount of loan was also paid at Bombay.  The amount, as per the agreements, was also to be repaid at Bombay and therefore, it can be safely said that part of the cause of action for institution of the suit has arisen at Bombay and therefore, Bombay High Court has the jurisdiction to entertain the suit.

Further, before passing any such order the Tribunal ought to have given notice to the defendant as well as afforded a fair opportunity of being heard on that question.  Besides, when the defendant upon notice makes admission of any amount out of the claim amount due to the plaintiff, in the first place the Tribunal would give one month's time to the defendant to make the payment and only on failure to do so that the recovery certificate to the extent of admitted claim could be issued.  In the present case, nothing of this sort has happened.  The abovesaid statutory provisions are nothing but in the nature of providing fair opportunity to the defendant before issuance of recovery certificate against him.  Noncompliance of these provisions would obviously amount to breach of procedure established by law.  In the present case undisputedly the order for issuing recovery certificate is passed in absence of any application in that behalf muchless any notice to the petitioners that the tribunal will be called upon to pass such order or for that matter having apprised the petitioners that the Tribunal was proposing to pass such order on the basis of the statement in the balance sheet.  This has the inevitable effect of infraction of principles of natural justice and fair play.  A priori, the order passed by the Tribunal on June 26, 2002 is vitiated.  In such a case the Appellate Tribunal was obliged to exercise its power to waive the amount of pre-deposit by virtue of the proviso to section 21 of the Act.

Union of India reported in 1998 (103) E.L.T. 5(S.C.), while considering similar situation under the provisions of the Central Excise Act, 1944, has held that requiring the assessee to pay pre-deposit amount as a condition for hearing of appeal will be unsustainable.  The Appellate Tribunal in this case, therefore, ought to have allowed the application preferred by the petitioners for waiver.\t [Para 6]\n\n1998 (103) E.L.T. 5(SC) - Followed."

Court cannot attribute to the Legislature any ignorance in this regard. It is for the Legislature, who alone is the best Judge of the needs of the people, to decide as to whether an enactment is enough or whether modifications or amendment to the same are necessary or whether another substantive enactment would be needed so as to overcome the lacunae and defects noticed in the earlier Statute. It is for the Legislature to consider and decide as to whether the RDB Act was enough or it was necessary to enact the Securitisation Act. Further, it is for the Legislature to define the concepts and legal terms. It is for the Legislature to make a provision in the RDB Act by amending it that a securitisation company or re-construction company which has obtained a certificate of registration under section 3(4) of the Securitisation Act is a financial institution within the meaning of RDB Act 1993. Once the Legislature is of the view that in the light of the subsequent enactment i.e. the Securitisation Act, even the RDB Act needs to be amended suitably, then, all that remains for consideration is whether the amendment to RDB Act is to be construed widely or the restricted interpretation deserves to be accepted. The Court merely interprets the law enacted by the Legislature whenever called upon to do so. There is clear demarcation of the field inasmuch as the Legislature enacts, Executive implements and the Judiciary interprets the Statutes.\n\nThe RDB Act is an Act providing for establishment for expeditious adjudication and recovery of debts due to banks and financial institutions.\n\nHeld, the amendment to the definition of the term \"Financial Institution\" as appearing in section 2(h) of the RDB Act and bringing into force of the Securitisation Act is a development post judgment of this Court in Krishna Filaments reported in 2004(2) Mh.L.J. 823. In fact, it is precisely to get over the narrow interpretation placed on the term \"debt\" by this Court that the Legislature has stepped in and amended the RDB Act 1993. If there was any doubt about a debt which is assigned by a bank or financial institution, being recovered by filing an application before DRT established under section 3 of the RDB Act, that is cleared by insertion of sub-section (ia) in section 2(h) of the RDB Act. That insertion together with the wide wording of the term \"debt\" is enough to reach the conclusion that the securitisation company or re-construction company contemplated by the Securitisation Act can step in and proceed with the matter/ application which has been instituted by its predecessor in title/ assignee/ financial institution. If this interpretation is not placed, then, the very purpose and object of amending the definition of the word \"financial institution\" would be defeated. This coupled with the rights that are acquired by securitisation company or re-construction company by virtue of section 5 of the Securitisation Act, would enable the Court to conclude that the narrow and restricted view no longer prevails.  2004(2) Mh.L.J. 823 - No longer good law. \t [Para 24,25,27]"

                "description": "Debt Recovery Tribunal - Not a Civil Court.\n\nThe Tribunal is constituted with a specific purpose as is evident from its statement of objects. The preamble of the Act also is a pointer to that too. It has a limited jurisdiction. Under the Act, as it originally stood, did not even have any power to entertain a claim of set off or counter-claim. No independent proceedings can be initiated before it by a debtor. A debtor under the common law of contract as also in terms of the loan agreement may have an independent right. No forum has been created for endorsement of that right. Jurisdiction of a civil court as noticed hereinbefore is barred only in respect of the matters which strictly come within the purview of Section 17 thereof and not beyond the same. The Civil Court, therefore, will continue to have jurisdiction. Even in respect of set off or counter-claim, having regard to the provisions of sub-sections (6) to (11) of Section 19 of the Act, it is evident :-\n\na) That the proceedings must be initiated by the bank.\n\nb) Some species of the remedy as provided therein would be available therefor.\n\nc) In terms of sub-section (11) of Section 19, the bank or the financial institution is at liberty to send a borrower out of the forum.\n\nd) In terms of the provisions of the Act, thus, the claim of the borrower is excluded and not included.\n\ne) In the event the bank withdraws his claim the counter-claim would not survive which may be contrasted with Rule 6 of Order 8 of the Code.\n\nf) Sub-section (9) of Section 19 of the Act in relation thereto has a limited application.\n\ng) The claim petition by the bank or the financial institution must relate to a lending/borrowing transaction between a bank or the financial institution and the borrower.\n\nh) The banks or the financial institutions, thus, have a primacy in respect of the proceedings before the Tribunal.\n\ni) An order of injunction, attachment or appointment of a receiver can be initiated only at the instance of the bank or the financial institution. We, however, do not mean to suggest that a Tribunal having a plenary power, even otherwise would not be entitled to pass an order of injunction or an interim order, although ordinarily expressly it had no statutory power in relation thereto.\n\nj) It can issue a certificate only for recovery of its dues. It cannot pass a decree.\n\nk) Although an appeal can be filed against the judgment of the Tribunal, pre-deposit to the extent of 75% of the demand is imperative in character.\n\nl) Even cross-examination of the witnesses need not be found to be necessary.\n\nm) Subject to compliance of the principle of natural justice it may evolve its own procedure.\n\nn) It is not bound by the procedure laid down under the Code. It may however be noticed in this regard that just because the Tribunal is not bound by the Code, it does not mean that it would not have jurisdiction to exercise powers of a court as contained in the Code. 'Rather, the Tribunal can travel beyond the Code of Civil Procedure and the only fetter that is put on its powers is to observe the principles of natural justice.'  The Tribunal, therefore, would not be a Civil Court.  [Para 112]"

For the said purpose, a legal fiction is required to be created before it would have all attributes of a civil court. The Tribunal could have been treated to be a civil court provided it could pass a decree and it had all the attributes of a civil court including undertaking of a full-fledged trial in terms of the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure and/or the Evidence Act.\n\nIt is now trite law that jurisdiction of a court must be determined having regard to the purpose and object of the Act. If the Parliament, keeping in view the purpose and object thereof thought it fit to create separate tribunal so as to enable the banks and the financial institutions to recover the debts expeditiously wherefor the provisions contained in the Code of Civil Procedure as also the Evidence Act need not necessarily be resorted to, by taking recourse to the doctrine of purposive construction, another jurisdiction cannot be conferred upon it so as to enable this Court to transfer the case from the civil court to a tribunal.  Expeditious recovery of the debts above Rs.10 lakhs is the object of the Act. Casus omissus, if any, it is well-known cannot be supplied by the court. \t\t\t\t\t [Para 103,105]\n\nThe Tribunals are neither civil courts nor courts subordinate to the High Court. The High Court ordinarily can be approached in exercise of its writ jurisdiction under Article 226 or its jurisdiction under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. The High Court exercises such jurisdiction not only over the courts but also over the Tribunals. Appellate tribunals have been constituted for determining the appeals from judgments and orders of the Tribunal. The principles of purposive construction, therefore, in our opinion, are not attracted in the instant case. Had the Parliament intended to make the Tribunals civil courts, a legal fiction could have been raised. There are statues like the Andhra Pradesh Land Grabbing Act where such a legal fiction has been raised.  2009(3) SCALE 685 Ref.  JT 2004(9) SC 136 Rel. on."

Civil P.C. (1908), S.9.\n\nThe Civil Court indisputably has the jurisdiction to try a suit. If the suit is vexatious or otherwise not maintainable action can be taken in respect thereof in terms of the Code. But if all suits filed in the Civil Courts, whether inextricably connected with the application filed before the DRT by the banks and financial institutions are transferred, the same would amount to ousting the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts indirectly. Suits filed by the debtor may or may not be counter claims to the claims filed by banks or financial institutions but for that purpose consent of the plaintiff is necessary. It is furthermore difficult to accept the contentions of the respondents that the statutory provisions contained in sections 17 and 18 of the DRT Act have ousted the jurisdiction of the civil court as the said provisions clearly state that the jurisdiction of the civil court is barred in relation only to applications from banks and financial institutions for recovery of debts due to such banks and financial institutions.  (2006)5 SCC 72, (1968)3 SCR 662, (2003)6 SCC 220, 2003(4) ALL MR 1193 (S.C.), (2005)7 SCC 447 - Rel. on. \t [Para 119]\n\nThe Act, although, was enacted for a specific purpose but having regard to the exclusion of jurisdiction expressly provided for in Sections 17 and 18 of the Act, it is difficult to hold that a civil court's jurisdiction is completely ousted. Indisputably the banks and the financial institutions for the purpose of enforcement of their claim for a sum below Rs.10 lakhs would have to file civil suits before the civil courts. It is only for the claims of the banks and the financial institutions above the aforementioned sum that they have to approach the Debt Recovery Tribunal.\n\nIt is also without any cavil that the banks and the financial institutions, keeping in view the provisions of Sections 17 and 18 of the Act, are necessarily required to file their claim petitions before the Tribunal. The converse is not true.\n\nDebtors can file their claims of set off or counter-claims only when a claim application is filed and not otherwise. Even in a given situation the banks and/or the financial institutions can ask the Tribunal to pass an appropriate order for getting the claims or set-off or the counter claims, determined by a civil court. The Tribunal is not a high powered tribunal. It is a one man Tribunal. Unlike some Special Acts, as for example Andhra Pradesh Land Grabbing (Prohibition) Act, 1982 it does not contain a deeming provision that the Tribunal would be deemed to be a civil court. \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 127,129]\n\nSub-section (2) of Section 22 deals with applicability of the provisions of the Code in a limited manner. Sub-section (3) raises a legal fiction that the proceeding before the Tribunal or the Appellate Tribunal shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of Sections 193 and 228 and for all the purposes of Section 196 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The very fact that a legal fiction has been created and the Tribunal or the Appellate Tribunal shall be deemed to be a civil court for purposes of Section 195 and Chapter XXVI of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1973, itself suggests that the Parliament did not intend to take away the jurisdiction of the civil court. In any event, the said legal fIction has a limited application. Its scope and ambit cannot be extended.  [Para 138]\n\nDisposal of a civil suit takes a long time. But indisputably remedy of summary and speedy trial by itself would not be sufficient to oust the jurisdiction of the civil court. Had the intention of the Parliament been so, it could have expressly said so. Casus omissus, as is well known, cannot be supplied.   [Para 141]"

In the instant case. therefore, the suit is substantially a suit not for recovery of debt, but for recovery of machinery and damages. Consequently this Court will have Jurisdiction.  [Para 6]\n\nUnder the Debt Recovery Act there is no total ouster of jurisdiction of the Civil Court. The ouster is by virtue of Section 18, which sets out that no Court or other authority can try matters for recovery of debts. In so far as the reliefs which do not pertain to debts on a plain reading of Section 17 of the Debt Recovery Act there can be no doubt that the Civil Court will still retain jurisdiction. The ouster of jurisdiction in these cases would be to find out as to what is the cause of action and not merely the relief prayed for. For the Tribunal to have jurisdiction the cause of action must be substantially for recovery of debt. Once from the averments it is found that the cause of action is substantially for recovery of debt then the Tribunal will have jurisdiction to grant and decide ancillary reliefs issues provided the order passed can be executed in the manner provided by the Debt Recovery Act.  [Para 4]\n\nIn suits of the present nature the jurisdiction of the Civil Court will not be ousted bearing in mind that there is no provision for referring an issue to the Tribunal after the suit is filed on coming into force of the Debt Recovery Act. The purpose of the Act is to provide a speedy means for banks and financial institutions to recover their debts. If it is held that such institutions must be compelled to file two different proceedings it will frustrate the very object of the Act. Therefore, in my opinion considering the object underlying the Act, the Scheme of the Act, the certificate issued for recovery of debt, it is the Civil Court which will have jurisdiction.  [Para 6]"

It only means that if a bank/ financial institution approaches the DRT under Section 19(1) of the RDB Act and DRT exercises jurisdictional power or authority under Section 17, in appropriate matters the jurisdiction of High Court under Article 226 of Constitution of India is saved. A harmonious reading of Sections 17 and 18 of the RDB Act would show that it is only in relation to the matters specified in Section 17, Section 18 does not bar the jurisdiction of High Court under Article 226 of Constitution of India subject to other principles of law. In this case, the petitioner bank admittedly has not approached the DRT and straightaway approached High Court. Therefore, the writ petition cannot be entertained even as per Section 18 of the RDB Act.  [Para 15]"

Rel.\n\nIt cannot be said that once the Court appoints the Court Receiver, the proceedings which are interim in nature come to an end. It would be an anomalous position to say that although the main suit has been transferred to the DRT, the interim proceedings in which the Court Receiver is appointed before the cut-off date continue to remain within the jurisdiction of this Court.\n\nAll suits and other proceedings pending in this Court before the cut-off date shall stand transferred to the DRT. This will include even execution applications in which the Court Receiver is appointed prior to the cut-off date.\n\nEven in cases where proceedings stand transferred to DRT, the properties shall continue to remain custodia-legis either under the High Court or under the DRT.\n\nThe property shall remain custodia-legis with the Court Receiver till such time as the DRT appoints a receiver under the Act, in which event, a request will be made by the receiver of DRT to the Court Receiver to hand over the properties to the receiver of DRT. Therefore, there is no merit in the contention advanced that after 16th July 1999 a fresh application will become necessary, seeking appointment of a receiver, to the DRT.\n\nIf this Court has already appointed a receiver before 16th July 1999, the property shall continue to remain cutodia-legis till the suit is disposed of by the DRT. Hence, no fresh application for appointment of receiver is required to be made to DRT. It may be open to DRT, on an application of a party, to discharge its receiver. However, ipso facto by reason of transfer of suits and proceedings the Court Receiver does not stand discharged. There will be no question of making a fresh application for appointment of receiver. \n\nIt cannot be said that the Court Receiver appointed by this Court stands automatically discharged after 16th July 1999. Till such rights are determined by DRT, the property remains custodia-legis. Even after coming into force of the DRT Act and the DRT the said rights to the possession of the funds/properties held by the receiver remain undecided and, therefore, till DRT appoints its receiver under DRT Act, 1993 this Court can certainly issue directions on the reports of the Court Receiver regarding management and protection of the assets which are custodia-legis.

(1908), S.21.\n\nWhere the petitioner claimed that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction over the subject matter of the suit as amount due to the bank was only Rs.7.92 lacs and the Tribunal can have jurisdiction only in cases above 10 lacs, the question was whether the compensation and interest thereon can be said to be the money due from the defendant to the plaintiffs, it was held that according to the definition of the word \"debt\" as appearing in the Act, it means any liability inclusive of interest which is claimed as due by any person to a bank.  In the instant case, it is the contention of the bank that Rs.12,83 lacs is a debt due from the defendants.  Because according to the bank it is a liability which is claimed by the bank as due from the defendant and the same includes the liability admitted by the defendants as also the loss and compensation claimed by the bank.  There is no room therefore in the definition of the debt for exclusion of a sum which the bank as Plaintiff thinks in a debt or a liability due to it from the defendants.  What is liable to be decreed on appreciation of the pleadings and evidence led by the parties, would be determined by the tribunal.  It is not necessary that the tribunal must decree the entire claim.  It will be always within the jurisdiction of the tribunal to decree the sum lesser than Rs.10 lacs. [Para 10]"

It should have arisen during the course of any business activity undertaken by the bank or the financial institution or the consortium under any law for the time being in force. The liability to be discharged may be in cash or otherwise. It would be immaterial whether the liability is secured or unsecured or whether it is payable under a decree or an order of any civil Court or otherwise. However, it should be subsisting and legally recoverable on the date on which proceedings are initiated for recovering the same.  [Para 7]\n\nThe important words in the definition \"alleged as due\" have been overlooked by the High Court and, therefore, it has erroneously held that unless the amounts claimed by the bank are determined or decided by a competent forum they cannot be said to be due and would not amount to 'debt' under the Act. What was necessary for the High Court to consider was whether the bank has alleged in the suits that the amounts are due to the bank from the respondents, that the liability of the respondent has arisen during the course of its business activity, that the said liability is still subsisting and legally recoverable.

                "description": "Civil P.C. (1908), S.9 - Recovery of debt - Bar to jurisdiction of Civil Court - Matters pertaining to third party claims regarding attachment or sale of property or execution - Held, jurisdiction of Civil Court is not totally ousted.\n\nD.R.T. has exclusive jurisdiction to decide the application from banks and financial institutions for recovery of debts as defined under Section 2(g) of the Act. Section 18 makes it clear that in respect of such exclusive jurisdiction pertaining to debts conferred by Section 17 no Court or Authority shall have jurisdiction. This obviously would not include a third party claimant, who is not liable for any debt. The judgment in Dr. Anil Nandkishor Tibrewala which considered Section 19(25) of the RDB Act will have to be considered in the context that where an order is passed which has the effect of amounting to an abuse of the process of the Court, then it may be open to the Tribunal to examine the issue to the extent that it can consider. Chapter V deals and specifies the procedure in so far as recovery of debt already determined by the Tribunal. Section 25 provides the mode of recovery of debts. Section 26 makes it clear that the defendant cannot dispute the correctness of the amounts specified in the certificate and any other objection to the certificate. Section 27 amongst others confers a power to correct a clerical or arithmetical mistake in the Certificate by withdrawing the certificate. Section 27 is a power of granting stay. Section 28 provides other modes of recovery other than that provided under Section 25. Sections 25, 26, 27 and 28, therefore, deal exclusively with the recovery of amounts under a certificate issued under Section 19 and mode of recovery if the amounts set out in the certificate. Section 29 in the context of recovery of the amounts due under the certificate makes applicable the provisions of Income Tax Act and certificate proceedings Rules as set out. Section 30 as now substituted by Act 1 of 2000 begins with a non-obstante clause. A person aggrieved by an order of the Recovery Officer may within thirty days from the date on which a copy of the order is issued to him, prefer an appeal to the Tribunal. Under Sub-section (2) of Section 30 a power is given to set aside or modify an order made under Sections 25 to 28. Section 30 co-jointly with Section 29 would mean that irrespective of the Appellate remedy provided in Part VI of IInd Schedule (Rule 86) to the I.T. Act an Appeal would lie to the Tribunal in respect of orders made under the Second Schedule to the I.T. Act. Considering the language of Rule 11(6) an appeal would not lie under Rule 86 of the Second Schedule. Therefore, under Section 30 even if an appeal as provided under Rule 86 is not available because of Rule 11(6) making the order of the Recovery Officer conclusive, nevertheless Section 30 of the Act provides a remedy by way of Appeal against the order passed under the IInd Schedule. Section 20 is a provision for Appeal from an order of the Tribunal, when Section 30 is a provision for appeal against the order of the Recovery Officer. If the Act itself provides a remedy is it open to a Court by a process of interpretation to deny to a party that remedy which is a remedy under the Act itself. Under Rule 9 of the Schedule II to the Income Tax every question arising between the Recovery Officer and the defaulter as set out has to be determined by the Recovery Officer and not by a suit. In other words the jurisdiction of the Civil Court in such matter is barred. Under Rule 11 when a claim or objection is preferred by a third party to the attachment or sale of property, under Rule 11(6) the party against whom an order is passed may institute a Civil Suit. This, therefore, is a remedy expressly provided by the Act itself. Thus in matters pertaining to execution of certificate, apart from the modes available under Sections 25 to 28, by virtue of Section 29, which by incorporation has made the provision of the Second and Third Schedule to the Income Tax Act and the Income Tax (Certificate Proceedings) Rules, 1962 as a part of Chapter V of the R.D.B. Act that mode is also available. Thus the R.D.B. Act itself in a matter pertaining to execution or enforcement of a certificate and objection claim by a third party to attachment or sale has provided the remedy of suit. Thus it would be clear that in such matters the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is not barred. Decision in 2006(5) ALL MR 676 and 2004(4) Bom.C.R. 842 - Ref. to.  [Para 27,29]"

The suit is clearly triable by the Civil Court being for recovery of a sum less than rupees ten lakhs and therefore not barred by the provisions of the Act.  In fact that R.D.D.B.F.I. Act has no application to such a suit vide sub-section(4) of section 1.\n\nSecondly, even though the defendant was entitled and is entitled in law to claim a set-off or to set up a counter-claim such a counter-claim would not have the effect of removing the lis from the jurisdiction of the Civil Court because it would not be a counter-claim \"in an application\" by a Bank.  Now, application has been defined by section(2)(b) as follows :-\n\n\"\"application\" means an application made to a Tribunal under section 19;\"\n\nSection 19 enables a Bank or financial institution to make an application to the Tribunal for recovery of a debt in the circumstances and in the manner prescribed therein.  It is thus clear that the counter-claim is not a counter-claim to an application made by the Bank but is, on the other hand, a counter claim made by a person who is not entitled to invoke the provisions of the R.D.D.B.F.I. Act.  It may be noted that this Act was enacted for expeditious adjudication and recovery of debts due to Banks and financial institutions.  Thus on the basic principle that it is the plaint or the initial action that must determine the jurisdiction and not the response to that action, a counter-claim made by a person other than a Bank or financial institution for a sum greater than ten lakh rupees would not have the effect of removing the lis in which such claim is made, from the jurisdiction of the Civil Court.  No illegality would ensue as a result of this view since the suit filed by the Bank in the present case is clearly within the jurisdiction of the Civil Court being for an amount less than ten lakh rupees; and so is the counter-claim, being one filed by a person which is not a Bank or a financial institution and who is required by law to approach a Civil Court for redress.  2000(4) ALL MR 875 (S.C.) - Distinguished.\t\t  [Para 14,15]"

In order to show that Rules 57 and 58 of the Second Schedule of the Income Tax Act may be departed from under the RDDB Act, it would have to be proved that the application of these Rules is \"not at all practicable\" in the context of RDDB Act.\n\nIt is, therefore, reasonable to hold that the phrase \"as far as possible\" used in Section 29 of the RDDB Act can at best mean that the Income Tax Rules may not apply where it is not at all possible to apply them having regard to the scheme and the context of the legislation. \t\t\t\t    [Para 21,23,26]"

Needless to emphasise, the Official Liquidator has a role under the 1956 Act. He protects the interests of the workmen and the creditors and, hence, his association at the time of auction and sale has been thought appropriate. To put it differently, he has been conferred locus to put forth his stand in the said matters. Therefore, anyone who is aggrieved by any act done by the Recovery Officer can prefer an appeal. Such a statutory mode is provided under the RDB Act, which is a special enactment. The DRT has the powers under the RDB Act to make an enquiry as it deems fit and confirm, modify or set aside the order made by the Recovery Officer in exercise of powers under Sections 25 to 28 (both inclusive) of the RDB Act. Thus, the auction, sale and challenge are completely codified under the RDB Act, regard being had to the special nature of the legislation.\n\n2000(3) ALL MR 475 (S.C.), 2006(2) ALL MR 212 (S.C.)

                "description": "Transfer of pending cases - No suit but appeal pending on crucial date - Appeal subsequently allowed and matter remanded - Remand order has effect of reviving suit from date it was originally filed - Suit is liable to be transferred.\n\nIt is true that under sub-clause (c) of Section 31, every suit or proceeding \"pending before any Court immediately before the date of establishment of the Tribunal under the Act\" shall stand transferred to the Tribunal. It is also true that under the proviso to Section 31(1), appeals pending on the date do not stand transferred. The suit of the Bank was in fact, pending in appeal on 27-4-94, and it is clear that this provision for transfer does not apply to an appeal pending as aforesaid before any Court. But, it is now well settled that an order of remand by the appellate Court to the trial Court which had disposed of the suit revives the suit in full except as to matters, if any decided finally by the appellate Court. Once the suit is revived, it must, in the eye of the law, be deemed to be pending - from the beginning when it was instituted. The judgment disposing of the suit passed by the single Judge which is set aside gets effaced altogether and the continuity of the suit in the trial Court is restored, as a matter of law. The suit cannot be treated as one freshly instituted on the date of the remand order. Otherwise serious questions as to limitation would arise. In fact, if any evidence was recorded before its earlier disposal, it would be evidence in the remanded suit and if any interlocutory orders were passed earlier, they would revive. In the case of a remand, it is as if the suit was never disposed of (subject to any adjudication which has become final, in the appellate judgment). The position could have been different if the appeal was disposed of once and for all and the suit was not remanded.  [Para 15,16]\n\nApplying the above principle, the suit filed by the Bank in 1985, even though it was disposed of by judgment dated 29-3-94, it stood revived with continuity by the remand order passed by the Division Bench on 11-8-98, and cannot be treated as a freshly instituted on 11-8-98 before the single Judge but must, in the eye of the law, be treated as pending on the crucial day i.e. 27-4-94.\n\nIf while a suit is pending, a law like the 1993 Act that the Civil Court shall not decide the suit, is passed, the Civil Court is bound to take judicial notice of the statute and hold that the suit - even after its remand - cannot be disposed of by it.  [Para 20]\n\nIf it is not to be transferred to the Tribunal and if it is to be retained in the Civil Court, without disposal as contended, then there will be a stalemate. It has to be kept perpetually pending in the Civil Court and necessarily the file has to be consigned to the record room. Or the plaint will have to be returned for presentation before the proper Court or Tribunal. That was surely not the intendment of the Act of 1993. When this aspect was put to the learned senior counsel for the respondents, there was practically no answer. It was, no doubt, faintly suggested that the bar in Section 18 does not apply to remanded suits but we are unable to agree. As stated earlier, they stand revived in law with continuity and therefore the bar under Section 18 clearly applies.  [Para 23]\n\nThe remanded suit cannot remain in the Civil Court with no chance of disposal. Again, our decision that the restoration of the suit is with continuity from the date of original institution of the suit does not amount to legislation but is the result of the application of a fundamental principle of law applicable to the civil procedure. It cannot therefore be said that we have encroached upon the jurisdiction of the legislature.  [Para 29]\n\nFor the aforesaid reasons, the principle of purposive interpretation is to be applied to Sections 18 and 31 of the Act and that suit 410/1985 filed by the Bank in 1985 and which stood remanded by the appellate Court on 11-8-98 must in the eye of the law be deemed pending before the single Judge and that it would stand transferred to the Tribunal. The High Court was, therefore, in error in retaining the same on the original side.  [Para 33]"

An agreement not to charge interest, the specific performance of which is claimed is nothing but a plea that the Bank could not charge interest. A permanent injunction directing the Bank not to charge interest because of an alleged agreement in that behalf is likewise a plea that no interest is chargeable. So far as the plea for further financial assistance is concerned, it is also, broadly, in the nature of a 'counterclaim'. All these fall under Section 19(8) to (10). Again, the plea for deducting 'damages' though raised in the suit is indeed broadly a plea of \"set off\" falling under sub-clauses (6) and (7) of Section 19.  [Para 41]\n\nBoth the suits, the one by the Bank against the respondent (suit 410/85) and the other by the debtor-against the Bank (suit 272/85) which raises claims or pleas in the nature of set-off or counter-claim are interconnected. The respondent's suit falls under sub-clauses (6), (7) and (8) to (11) of Section 19, as stated above. Our decision in regard to the real nature of suit 272/85 has become necessary in the context of a plea by the debtor-company that the company's suit is liable to be retained in the civil Court and on account of the plea that the Connected suit, suit by the Bank 410/85, is also to be retained. Such a plea, as shown above.  [Para 42]"

The RDB Act requires the Tribunal alone to decide applications for recovery of debts due to Banks or financial institutions. Once the Tribunal passes an order that the debt is due, the Tribunal has to issue a certificate under Section 19(22) (formerly under section 19(7)) to the Recovery Officer for recovery of the debt specified in the certificate. The question arises as to the meaning of the word 'recovery' in Section 17 of the Act. Basically the Tribunal is to adjudicate the liability of the defendant and then it has to issue a certificate under Section 19(22). Under Section 18, the jurisdiction of any other Court or authority which would otherwise have had jurisdiction but for the provisions of the Act, is ousted and the power to adjudicate upon the liability is exclusively vested in the Tribunal. (This exclusion does not however apply to the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court or of a High Court exercising power under Article 226 or 227 of the Constitution). This is the effect of Sections 17 and 18 of the Act.  [Para 21]\n\nEven in regard to 'execution', the jurisdiction of the Recovery Officer is exclusive. Now a procedure has been laid down in the Act for recovery of the debt as per the certificate issued by the Tribunal and this procedure is contained in Chapter V of the Act and is covered by Sections 25 to 30. It is not the intendment of the Act that while the basic liability of the defendant is to be decided by the Tribunal under Section 17, the Banks/Financial institutions should go to the Civil Court or the Company Court or some other authority outside the Act for the actual realisation of the amount. The certificates granted under Section 19(22) has to be executed only by the Recovery Officer. No dual jurisdictions at different stages are contemplated. Further, section 34 of the Act gives overriding effect to the provisions of the RDB Act.  [Para 23]"

Section 22 of the RDB Act, gives sufficiently wide powers to the Tribunal and the Appellate Tribunal to decide such questions of priorities, subject only to the principles of natural justice. The powers under Section 22 are wider than those of civil Courts and the only restriction on its power is that principles of natural justice have to be followed. But under S. 73 CPC, sharing in the sale proceeds (here, sale proceeds realised under the RDB Act) is permissible only if a person seeking such share has obtained a decree or an order of adjudication from the Tribunal and has not complied with other conditions laid down under Section 73. In the present case, the Canara Bank is not in a position to invoke the principles underlying Section 73 CPC because it has not yet obtained any decree or adjudication of its debt from the Tribunal. Nor has it complied with other provisions underlying Section 73 CPC. Hence no relief can be granted on the basis of the said priorities.  [Para 52,53]"

Whatever he loses towards \"workmen's portion' out of his security, can be claimed by him as a secured amount with priority over such creditors out of other realisations made by other creditors whose monies are lying in the Tribunal. At the same time, his position would not impose from what it was originally and his priority would not extend to his entice unrealised sums which might be in excess of his security.\n\nBut the point here is that the occasion for such a claim by a secured creditor (here the Canara Bank) against realisations by other creditors (like the Allahabad Bank) under Section 529-A read with proviso (c) to Section 529(1) can arise before the Tribunal only if the Canara Bank has stood outside winding up and realised amounts and if it shows that out of the amounts privately realised by it, some portion has been rateably taken away by the liquidator under sub-clause (a) and (b) of the proviso to Section 529(1). It is only then that it can claim that it is to be re-imbursed at the same level as a secured creditor with priority over the realisations of other creditors lying in the Tribunal. None of these conditions is satisfied by Canara Bank. Thus, Canara Bank does not belong to the class of secured creditors covered by Section 529-A(1)(b).\n\nTherefore, the Canara Bank cannot rely on the words in Section 19(19) viz, \"to be distributed among its secured creditors\" for claiming any amount lying in the Tribunal towards its security nor can it claim priority as against the Allahabad Bank.\n\nIf one of the conditions required for applying Section 19(19) and Section 529-A is, therefore, satisfied, then the claim of Canara Bank before the Tribunal can only be on the basis of principles underlying section 73 CPC. There being no decree in its favour from any Court or from any tribunal, and the other conditions of Section 73 not having been satisfied, no dividend can be claimed out of monies realised at the instance of the Allahabad Bank, even if the Allahabad Bank is an unsecured creditor.

The Act of 1993 was enacted to work out suitable mechanism through which the dues to the Banks and Financial Institutions could be recovered and realised without delay.  The Parliament felt the need to set up special Tribunals and fora for the speedy recovery of dues and loans to the banks and financial institutions as the significant portion of the funds was blocked and rendered unproductive.  The Parliament does not appear to have intended to discriminate between the co-operative banks and banking companies for the purposes of Act of 1993 and it was for this reason that in section 2(e) of the Act of 1993, it was provided that \"banking company\" shall have the meaning assigned to it in clause (c) of section 5 of the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 which by virtue of section 56(a)(i) included co-operative banks already.

                "description": "State Financial Corporations Act (1951), S.32(G) - Financial Corporation - Recovery of dues - Financial Corporation may either proceed under Financial Corporations Act, 1951 or under Recovery of Debts Act, 1993 - It cannot proceed under U.P. Act, 1972 - Interpretation of statutes - Principle of casus omissus.\n\nSection 34 of the Act consists of two parts. Sub-section (1) deals with the overriding effect of the Act notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than the Act. Sub-section (1) itself makes an exception as regards matters covered by sub-section (2). The U.P. Act is not mentioned therein. The mode of recovery of debt under the U.P. Act is not saved under the said provision i.e. sub-section (2) which is of considerable importance. Even a bare reading therein makes it clear that it is intended to be in addition to and not in derogation of certain statutes; one of which is the Financial Act. In other words, a Bank or Financial Institution has the option or choice to proceed either under the Act or under the modes of recovery permissible under the Financial Act. To that extent, the High Court's conclusions quoted above were correct. Where the High Court went wrong is by holding that proceedings under the U.P. Act were permissible, U.P. Act deals with separate modes of recovery and such proceedings are not relatable to proceedings under the Financial Act.  [Para 9]\n\nThe plea that mode of recovery under U.P. Act has to be read into S.34 of Recovery Act by application of principles known as casus omissus and the deficiency, if any, can be reconciled by purposive interpretation by reading the said statute as a whole and finding out the true legislative intent is not tenable.  Two principles of construction - one relating to casus omissus and the other in regard to reading the statute as a whole appear to be well settled. Under the first principle a casus omissus cannot be supplied by the Court except in the case of clear necessity and when reason for it is found in the four corners of the statute itself but at the same time a casus omissus should not be readily inferred and for that purpose all the parts of a statute or section must be construed together and every clause of a section should be construed with reference to the context and other clauses thereof so that the construction to be put on a particular provision makes a consistent enactment of the whole statute. This would be moreso if literal construction of a particular clause leads to manifestly absurd or anomalous results which could not have been intended by the Legislature.  [Para 14]"

DRT dismissed application.  Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT) dismissed the appeal.  High Court upheld order of DRAT.  In further appeal Supreme Court considered whether respondents 1 and 2 are 'financial institutions' within the meaning of DRT Act.  Supreme Court observed that section 4-A of the Companies Act provides that each of the financial institutions specified in sub-section (1) shall be regarded for the purpose of that Act, as a public financial institution.  The financial institutions specified included the 'Unit Trust of India' established under Section 3 of the UTI Act, 1963.  By operation of Section 18 of the UTI Act, 2002, 'Unit Trust of India' is substituted by the 'Specified Company' or 'Administrator of the Specified Undertaking', as the case may be.  Thus, the 'Specified Company' and the 'Administrator of the Specified Undertaking' must be deemed to be financial institutions specified in sub-section (1) of Section 4-A of the Companies Act.  Section 2(h) of the DRT Act defines a 'financial institution' to mean a public financial institution within the meaning of Section 4-A of the Companies Act.  Consequently by reason of deemed amendment of Section 4-A of the Companies Act, the 'Specified Company' and the 'Administrator of the Specified Undertaking' come within the definition of financial institutions as defined under Section 2(h) of DRT Act.  Court did not find that the use of words 'as the case may be' introduces any element of uncertainty.  [Para 27,28,29]"

                "description": "Recovery of dues - Control of Central Government - Jurisdiction of DRT - Application seeking recovery of dues in exercise of status and power conferred by statute - Nature of control of Central Government wholly irrelevant in considering question of jurisdiction of DRT.\n\nDRT did not accept appellant's contention that DRT had no jurisdiction to entertain Original Application filed by the respondents for alleged recovery of debts due to respondents.  Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT) dismissed appeal.  High Court upheld order of DRAT.  In further appeal Supreme Court considered whether the action before DRT is for recovery of debts due to them from appellant herein, and not due to any other person on whose behalf aforesaid respondents are suing.  Supreme Court observed that in place of Unit Trust of India both the respondents stand substituted.  Both are entitled to sue as financial institutions and question whether they have an enforceable claim must be decided in the facts and circumstances of each case.  There is no uncertainty because the assets possessed by these two identities are clearly enumerated in Schedules I and II of the Unit Trust of India (Transfer of Undertaking and Repeal) Act, 2002.  The erstwhile Unit Trust of India ceased to exist and in its place a specified company and an Administrator of the specified undertaking of the Trust came into existence.  The transfer and vesting of assets, rights etc. in these two bodies is in the widest possible terms as per section 5 of the Unit Trust of India (Transfer of Undertaking and Repeal) Act, 2002.  The transfer and vesting is complete.  The fact that the management is carried on by the Administrator of the specified undertaking on behalf of Central Government which is authorized to issue directions to the Administrator does not detract from the fact that the 'specified undertaking' vests in the Administrator.  Section 5 of the Act leaves no doubt that vesting in the Administrator or in the Specified Company is complete.  The powers vested in the Administrator under Section 10 of the Act cover almost every power of management and administration.  Section 10(1)(b) in particular authorizes him on the advice of the Board of Advisors to invest, acquire, hold or dispose of securities and to exercise and enforce all powers and rights incidental thereto including protection or realization of such investment etc.  Thus, it is a part of the power of management vested in the Administrator to invest as well as to realize such investments.  Apparently therefore, if any amount is owing to the specified undertaking, the Administrator has the authority to take all necessary steps to realize any amount due to the specified undertaking.  The statute vests this power in him.  It cannot therefore be assumed that he does not possess power to make recoveries in course of management.  The mere fact that Central Government may give him directions or he may seek instructions from Central Government does not mean that the power exercised by the Administrator are not the powers vested in him by law.  Subject to such directions as may be given by Central Government, it is the Administrator who must exercise his power of management and administration.  Apparently therefore in recovering dues owing to the specified undertaking, the Administrator exercises the powers vested in him under the Act in his own right since the undertaking vests in him, and the Act vests in him wide powers of management and administration which include the power to recover dues owing to the specified undertaking.  It is, therefore, futile to contend that the Administrator acts as an agent of the Central Government.  He acts in exercise of the powers vested in him by the statute and in the manner prescribed by the statute.  Even assuming that the Administrator manages the specified undertaking on behalf of Central Government, that will not make any difference.  The amounts sought to be recovered are allegedly owing to the Specified Company and the Administrator, who are 'financial institutions' within the meaning of DRT Act, 1993.  Thus, they are not seeking to recover any dues owing to Central Government, and therefore, they cannot be held to be acting on behalf of Central Government.  In their own right they are seeking to recover amounts due to them in exercise of status and power conferred upon them by statute.  So viewed, nature of control of Central Government over them is wholly irrelevant in considering question of jurisdiction of DRT to entertain such a claim.  There is nothing in the Act which may justify the submission that the specified company acts as a trustee.  It manages and executes the schemes contained in Schedule I of the Act in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  The Administrator and the Specified Company were therefore, fully authorized in law to recover dues from appellants as 'financial institutions' and DRT had undoubted jurisdiction to entertain their claims.  Appeal dismissed.  [Para 30,37,39]"

At the stage of initiation, there was no impediment in the way of Ombudsman in entertaining complaint or in proceeding with it. The impediment, if any, was caused by Bank's subsequent filing of Original Application before Debts Recovery Tribunal (DRT).

Ombudsman, though might have initially jurisdiction to entertain a complaint on basis that it has a legal foundation, here in terms of Scheme, he may be divested of that jurisdiction or foundation in law might be lost on either of parties approaching Court, Arbitrator or DRT in respect of same subject matter.\t [Para 10]\n\nThe complaint must continue to have a foundation in law at the time Ombudsman takes up claim for his consideration and renders his decision or award. The foundation would be lost when a Court, Arbitrator, Tribunal or any other competent forum is moved on the same subject matter.

High Court of Judicature at Bombay (Appellate side) Rules (1960), Rr.7, 8.\n\nThe Proviso to Section 83(1) is a mandatory requirement of filing a separate affidavit in the prescribed form in support of allegations of corrupt practices. The Rules framed by the High Court will not prevail over the provisions of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.  It was for the petitioner to present the petition as per the statutory provisions i.e. an Election Petition must be accompanied with a separate affidavit. Objection raised or not by the office is of no consequence.  Acceptance of affidavit by the office within the time of three days prescribed under the High Court Appellate Side Rules will not save the period of limitation prescribed by the Statute.  As stated above, the Election Petition in the present case is filed without accompanying a separate affidavit as required under Proviso to Section 83(1) of the Act.  Though the petition was verified and sworn in by the petitioner as required under the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, that verification does not amount to compliance of Proviso to Section 83(1) of the Act.  The affidavit filed on 19-01-2005 and acceptance of the same by the High Court office on the same day will not save the period of limitation of forty-five days prescribed under Section 81 of the Act.  Hence, the affidavit filed by the petitioner found filed after the period of limitation.  Thus, the petition as presented by the petitioner is found to be a petition without accompanying by an affidavit as required under Proviso to Section 83(1) of the Act.\n\nThe affidavit in support of allegations of corrupt practices forms a part of the Election Petition.  The Election Petition and the affidavit is held to be one document consisting of two parts, one is Election Petition proper and another is affidavit referred to in the Proviso to Section 83(1) of the Act.  Thus, a separate affidavit required under Proviso to Section 83(1) of the Act which needs to be filed along with the Election Petition forms a part of Election Petition itself.  Thus, a petition without an affidavit required under Proviso to Section 83(1) of the Act can be said to be an incomplete petition.  (1974)4 SCC 237 -Ref. to. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 13,14,16]"

In the present case also, election petition came to be filed on the last day of the prescribed period of limitation without filing an affidavit as required under Proviso to Section 83(1) of the Act.  Subsequent filing of affidavit on 19-01-2005 after expiry of the period of limitation is not permissible as it amounts to insertion of a ground after expiry of the period of limitation.

Running Allowance under the Rules is required to be paid only to the running staff who are engaged in the performance of duties directly connected with the movement of trains and such allowance includes kilometerage allowance or allowance in lieu of kilometerage (ALK). While kilometerage allowance is to be paid for performance of actual running duties, the allowance in lieu of kilometerage (ALK) is to be paid to such members of the running staff who are temporarily required to perform stationary duties. The rules also make it clear that 30% of the basic pay of the running staff is required to be treated as representing the pay element in the Running Allowance. Those members of the running staff who are employed on non-running duties are paid the aforesaid 30% of the basic pay if such nonrunning duties are performed at the headquarters whereas in case such non-running duties are performed by the running staff at outstations they are required to be paid ALK at the rates prescribed by Rule 907(b). It is thus clear that no Running Allowance i.e. either kilometerage allowance or allowance in lieu of kilometerage is contemplated for any staff, including erstwhile members of the running staff, permanently engaged in performance of stationary duties. Running Allowance of either description is required to be paid only to members of the running staff who are directly engaged in actual movement of trains or such staff who are temporarily assigned stationary duties but who are likely to go back and perform running duties. The respondent does not fall in either of the above two categories. Under Rule 903 of the Running Allowance Rules, as noticed above, 30% of the basic pay of the running staff represents the pay element in the Running Allowance. Therefore, in case of medically decategorised Driver, like the respondent, the said component being a part of the pay drawn by him as a running staff has to be protected. \t      [Para 9,11]"

It was not as if the petitioner had unwittingly breached a traffic regulation, which may not invite, even a frown from the general public. It was also not where he may had a minor altercation with someone which may well be overlooked by a reasonable man, as it would not involve any moral turpitude. He was facing a trial for the offence of murder, a crime of highest moral turpitude. Since time immemorial, Judges have been placed on a very high pedestal in every civilized society. Such high status is accompanied by corresponding responsibility of a judge maintaining an unusually high standard of dignity, poise and integrity. There can be no two ways about it! Therefore, the decision of the High Court to continue the suspension of the petitioner can not be said to be wholly unjustified till his acquittal by the Delhi High Court. [Para 34,35]"

The RRB Rules, 1998 clearly provided that officers holding post in 8 years as an officer on regular basis in the RRB shall be considered for promotion to the next higher post. The aforesaid rule does not provide that any employee/officer, who has suffered a punishment or has received an adverse appraisal/Grade 'D' in the performance appraisal, shall not be eligible. However, the Circulars dated 30th November, 2009 and 12th July, 2010 enables the appellant banks to eliminate such employees, which is clearly contrary to the provisions contained in the statutory service rules. The procedure prescribed under the aforesaid two Circulars clearly has the effect of supplanting the provision of eligibility, which is not permissible.\n\nWhilst assessing the eligibility of the candidates, determination of bare minimum merit is not envisaged. There is, in fact, a complete segregation of Rule 2(e) from Rule 2(f). Determining the eligibility of candidate is in the nature of a ministerial function. The management merely has to see that the candidate possesses the minimum length of service and that he/she is confirmed in the feeder cadre. The determination of bare minimum merit is on the basis of the performance in the written test/interview and performance appraisal. This is the function of the Selection Committee i.e. Departmental Promotion Committee.\n\nThere is no doubt that punishment and adverse service record are relevant to determine the minimum merit by the DPC. But to debar a candidate, to be considered for promotion, on the basis of punishment or unsatisfactory record would require the necessary provision in the statutory service Rules. There is no such provision under the 1998 Rules.\n\nDifferent rules/regulations of the banks provide specific punishments such as \"withholding of promotion, reduction in rank, lowering in ranks/pay scales\". However, there is another range of penalty such as censure, reprimand, withholding of increments etc. which are also prescribed under various staff regulations. To debar such an employee from being considered for promotion would tantamount to also inflicting on such employee, the punishment of withholding of promotion. In such circumstances, a punishment of censure/ reprimand would, in fact, read as censure/reprimand + 5 years debarment from promotion. Thus the circulars issued by the bank debarring such employees from being considered would be clearly contrary to the statutory rules.\t            [Para 31,35,36,40]"

In absence of statutory Rules, it is open to the employer to formulate its own promotion policy and parameters of weightage to be given in respect of seniority and merit separately.  As the Rules are silent regarding the weightage to be given for seniority, performance and interview, the employer vide circular dated 22/02/1996 supplemented the same and laid down the weightage for seniority, merit and the interview. Allocation of 30% marks for interview while selecting the candidates through promotion is not excessive.  [Para 10,11]\n\nPerusal of the circular will depict that the said circular is in-conformity with the Rules. The circular has specified the marks to be allocated under each head. The Rules, 1988 lay down the criteria i.e. while giving promotions the seniority, merit and interview will have to be considered but are silent regarding weightage of marks to be allocated under each head. The respondent-Bank has allotted the marks under each head after consultation with the unions of the officers. The respondent Bank vide said circular has not laid down any new criteria but has allocated marks under different heads which are specified in the Rules, 1988. The respondent-Bank has only supplemented and has not supplanted the rules, 1988. The same is perfectly permissible.  Further, in case of selection by interview test without written examination, allocation of 50% marks for viva voce tests is not excessive. In the present case, also there was no written test, as such fixing 30% marks for oral interview cannot be said to be excessive or irrational.\t [Para 13,14]"

                "description": "Accident to requisitioned vehicle - Liability of registered owner - Vehicle was requisitioned by Magistrate for election duty - Owner had no other alternative but to hand over the vehicle - He, thereafter, ceases to exercise any control over the vehicle - State and not the owner is liable to pay compensation in such a case.\n\nA vehicle is requisitioned by a statutory authority, pursuant to the provisions contained in a statute. The owner of the vehicle cannot refuse to abide by the order of requisition of the vehicle by the Deputy Commissioner. While the vehicle remains under requisition, the owner does not exercise any control thereover. The driver may still be the employee of the owner of the vehicle but he has to drive it as per the direction of the officer of the State, who is put in-charge thereof. Save and except for legal ownership, for all intent and purport, the registered owner of the vehicle loses entire control thereover. He has no say as to whether the vehicle should be driven at a given point of time or not. He cannot ask the driver not to drive a vehicle on a bad road. He or the driver could not possibly say that the vehicle would not be driven in the night. The purpose of requisition is to use the vehicle. For the period the vehicle remains under the control of the State and/or its officers, the owner is only entitled to payment of compensation therefor in terms of the Act but he cannot exercise any control thereupon. In a situation of this nature, this Court must proceed on the presumption that the Parliament while enacting the 1988 Act did not envisage such a situation. If in a given situation, the statutory definitions contained in the 1988 Act cannot be given effect to in letter and spirit, the same should be understood from the common sense point of view. Hence, the State shall be liable to pay compensation to the claimants and not the registered owner of the vehicle.  [Para 10,18]"

                "description": "Suspension of order of conviction - Appellate Court can suspend or stay order of conviction - Person seeking stay should specifically draw attention to consequences if conviction not stayed - Stay can be resorted to in rare cases depending upon special facts of case.\n\nAppellant acquitted by Sessions Judge, High Court in appeal convicted him.  Supreme Court suspended execution of sentence, considered request for suspending conviction.  Supreme Court held appellate Court can suspend or grant stay of order of conviction.  But person seeking stay of conviction should specifically draw attention of appellate Court to consequences that may arise if conviction is not stayed.  Unless attention of Court is drawn to specific consequences that would follow on account of conviction, person convicted cannot obtain an order of stay of conviction.  Further, grant of stay of conviction can be resorted to in rare cases depending upon special facts of case.  Though for purpose of decision of prayer for staying or suspending order of conviction, it is not necessary to minutely examine merits of case, nevertheless Court referred to medical evidence having bearing on nature of offense alleged to have been committed by appellant.  FIR did not specifically mention that appellant had given blow on head of deceased.  Incident happened all of a sudden without pre-meditation.  Deceased was wholly unknown to appellant.  There was no motive for commission of crime.  Accused alleged to have lost temper and started giving abuses on account of objection raised by occupants of Maruti car due to obstruction being caused by vehicle of appellant.  Blows by fist are alleged to have been given and no weapon of any kind used.  Medical evidence shows deceased had a diseased heart, and it not conclusively establishing that death occurred due to blow given on head.  No role in causing injury on head of deceased was attached to appellant, but in subsequent statements after several years specific role was assigned to appellant of hitting deceased on head by a fist and thereby making him responsible for causing death.  These features of case which touch upon culpability of appellant, prima facie appear to be in his favour.  Another feature which has a bearing is that findings on factual aspects of case recorded in favour of appellant by Sessions Judge resulting in acquittal have been reversed by High Court.  Incident taking place in 1988, has no co-relation with public life of appellant which he entered much later in 2004 when he was elected as a Member of Parliament.  It is not a case where he took advantage of his position as M.P. in commission of crime.  As already stated, it was not necessary for appellant to have resigned from membership of Parliament as he could in law continue as M.P. by merely filing an appeal and had he adopted such a course he could have easily avoided incurring any disqualification at least till decision of appeal.  However, he has chosen to adopt a moral path and has set high standards in public life by resigning from his seat and in seeking to get a fresh mandate from people.  If prayer made by appellant is not granted he would suffer irreparable injury as he would not be able to contest for seat which he held and has fallen vacant only on account of his voluntary resignation which he did on purely moral grounds.  Having regard to entire facts and circumstances mentioned above Court was of opinion that it was a fit case where order of conviction passed by High Court deserved to be suspended.

The argument of the petitioner that since he has made allegations against the Election Commissioner, the Returning officer and the Superintendent of police, they should be made as parties has no support from the provisions of the Act.  This is not a suit under common law or in equity where all interested parties can be made as parties.  This is an election tribunal trying an election petition vide 1951 Act and is bound by the provisions of the Act.  The only two provisions which provide for impleading parties are Sections 82 and 99.  As far as Section 82 is concerned, it speaks of only a candidate who is returned being made as party.  Under Section 99 of the Act if the Court comes to the conclusion that some third person has indulged in corrupt practices, then alone he can be made as party after giving him a notice about alleged corrupt practices.\n\nThere is no other provision in the Act which enables the Court to make third parties or other parties as parties to the election petition.\n\nNo doubt, Section 87 of the Act provides that while trying an election petition, the Court can adopt procedure applicable under the Code of Civil Procedure for trial of suits, but the Section starts with a clause \" subject to the provisions of this Act\".  Therefore, we have to read the applicability of Code of Civil Procedure subject to the provisions of the Act.

                "description": "Disqualification of being an \"undischarged insolvent\" - Definition of insolvent in Sale of Goods Act cannot be imported - To be disqualified as \"undischarged insolvent\" a person should have been adjudged insolvent and remain undischarged by a Court under Insolvency Act - Mere incapacity to pay debts does not make a person an undischarged insolvent.\n\nArticle 191(l)(c) of Constitution of India does not contemplate mere impecuniousity or incapacity of a person to repay one's debts but he should not only be adjudged insolvent but also remain undischarged. Such a contingency could only arise under insolvency law. Article 191(l)(c) refers to disqualifications  of a  person  from  getting elected to State Legislature. The conditions for disqualification cannot be enlarged by importing to it any meaning other than permissible on strict interpretation of expressions used therein for what we are dealing with is a case of disqualification. Whenever any disqualification is imposed naturally the right of a citizen is cut down and in that event a narrow interpretation is required.  Therefore, the liberal view taken by the learned Judge to the contrary does not appear to be correct.\n\nUnder the Sale of Goods Act, a special definition of the expression 'insolvent' had to be given to the effect that a person is said to be 'insolvent' who has ceased to pay his debts in the ordinary course of business, or cannot pay his debts as they become due, whether he has committed an act of insolvency or not, and the definition is declaratory in character.   Question of insolvency of a buyer is of considerable importance in the context of the seller's lien.   It is in special context a meaning is given to the expression 'insolvent' even though a person had not been adjudged an insolvent in the Insolvency Act to be insolvent for the purposes of the Act. That definition cannot be imported into the R.P. Act.\n\nThe learned Judge goes on to observe that an insolvent is a person who is unable to repay his debts and as long as he remains in that  position  he  is  an  undischarged insolvent, that is, as long as he has not discharged his debts he is an \"undischarged insolvent\".  Redundancy and tautology cannot be attributed to the Legislature. When the Legislature has  used the expression \"undischarged insolvent\" .that expression must be given its full meaning.  A person on being adjudged insolvent remains so unless discharged in terms of the provisions of Section 41 of the Insolvency Act, either absolutely or conditionally, or in the absence of annulment as contained in Section 35 of the Insolvency Act.  [Para 18,19,20]\n\nThe High Court was not justified in holding that the expression 'undischarged insolvent'  should be understood de hors the Insolvency Act in a general sense.  [Para 22]"

                "description": "Representation of the People Act (1950). S.16(2) Proviso - Disqualification of member on ground of corrupt practice - Member's name deleted from electoral roll as consequence - Disqualification expiring on 18-11-97 - His name has to be reinstated immediately in the existing electoral roll - Action of authority in reinstating his name in provisional roll effective on 1-1-98 is illegal - Interpretation of statutes - Proviso. \n\nWhere a member of parliament was disqualified for 4 years on ground of corrupt practice and his name was deleted from electoral roll as a consequence, on expiry of the disqualification on 18-11-97 his name has to be reinstated immediately in the electoral roll in existence on that date. Order of authorities to include his name in provisional roll effective form 1-1-98 is illegal.  [Para 14]\n\nTo suggest that the petitioner must wait till the new voters, list is published for his name being included, is far-fetched and may defeat the very purpose behind Section 16(2) of the 1950 Act. In the proviso, the words \"shall\" forthwith be reinstated in that roll, if such disqualification is, during the period such roll is in force, removed under any law authorising such \"removal.\" Must mean that the name of the petitioner or any person similarly placed as the petitioner must be reinstated forthwith in the electoral roll which is in force as on the date the disqualification period has expired. The emphasis, therefore, must be on the words \"such roll in force\". Viewed in that way, it has to be held that the name of the member ought to have been reinstated forthwith in the electoral roll which is valid and in force upto 31-12-1997.  [Para 15]\n\nThe controversy in the instant case is required to be decided by interpreting the proviso read with Section 11A(2) of the 1951 Act. No doubt, the difficulties some times arise in construing a proviso, but it is generally found that inconsistencies can be avoided by applying the general rule that the words of proviso are not to be taken absolutely in their strict literal sense but that a proviso as of a necessity is limited in its operation to the ambit of section which it qualifies. If, however, the language of the proviso makes it clear that it was intended to have operation more extensive than that of the provision which it immediately follows it must be given such wider effect. If the proviso can be reasonably construed, the proviso even if contradicting the main provision will prevail on the principle that it speaks the last intention of the maker.  [Para 12]\n\nFurther the instructions issued by the Election Commission of India are in the nature of administrative instructions so as to enable the authorities concerned to conduct free and fair elections and these instructions are mere guidelines. By no stretch of imagination, such instructions can be said to have over-riding effect on the provisions of law or nullify their object intended to be achieved by the Parliament. The instructions applicable to a first time voter or a voter, whose name is missing from the voters list for any other reason than an order of disqualification in a particular electoral roll and the said guidelines do not come to the rescue of the authorities in support of their contentions that their action to include the name of the petitioner in the electoral roll effective from 1-1-1998 is legal and proper. If contention of authorities is accepted the provisions of Section 11A(2) of the 1951 Act will be rendered redundant and by implication it shall mean that the period of disqualification is extended beyond the period of four years i.e. upto 31-12-1997.

                "description": "Rejection of election petition at the preliminary stage on the ground that it does not contain concise statement of material facts - Not valid.\n\nThe election petition of the appellant does not allege any corrupt practice.  Therefore, in the present case, the question of application of Section 83(1)(b) does not arise.  The only relevant provision, therefore, is Section 83(1)(a) which requires the petition to contain concise statement of material facts on which the petitioner relies.  The language of Section 83(1)(a) is similar to the language of Order VI Rule 2(1) which provides that \"Every pleading shall contain, and contain only, a statement in a concise from of material facts on which the party pleading relies for his claim or defence, as the case may be, but not the evidence by which they are to be proved\".  By contrast under Section 83(1)(b) not only is it necessary to set out full (as opposed to concise) particulars, but also a full statement of the names of parties who have allegedly committed a corrupt practice, and the date and place of its commission.\n\nThe election petition of the appellant, from paragraph 10onwards deals with the counting of ballot papers and why according to the appellant, such counting was unfair, improper or not in accordance with law.  He has alleged that the Returning Officer did not comply with Rule 56 of the conduct of Election Rules, 1961 and the instructions contained in the Hand-Book for Returning Officers.  He has given particulars of some of the irregularities.  In paragraph 15, for example, he has alleged that on counting table Nos.11 and 12, ballot papers marked on \"Hand\" symbol were mixed with those of other party candidates; and in the process ballot papers which were marked on \"Hand\" were not being counted in favour of the appellant.  The appellant has stated that his counting agents specifically stated to him when he visited the counting hall that hundreds of such ballot papers had already been mixed with the ballot papers in favour of an independent candidate, respondent No.9.  He has alleged that 3,530 votes which should have been counted in his favour were wrongly counted in favour of respondent No.9.  He has also referred to the contemporaneous written complaints lodged by him in this connection.  In paragraph 16, detailed tables are given showing the wrong counting of votes cast in favour of the appellant which were counted as the votes of respondent No.9.  The numbers of such votes so counted on each counting table have been separately set out in tabular form in detail.  The appellant has also sought leave to refer to and rely upon the various fax messages and complaints to the Returning Officer as well as to the General Observer made in this behalf by him.  Amongst the other objections, he has alleged that at the stage of the fourth round of counting onwards, ballot papers of two different colours were seen.  Despite the appellant complaining to the Returning Officer about the different colours of ballot papers on the counting tables, no proper attention was paid to his complaint.  He has also set out that his counting agents were not given a reasonable opportunity of inspecting ballot papers before they were rejected.  There are various other particulars set out in the election petition in support of the appellant's contention regarding irregularities and illegality in the counting of votes.\n\nWhatever be the merit of such contentions, one thing at least is clear.  The election petition cannot be rejected at a preliminary stage on the ground that it does not contain a concise statement of material facts."

In spite of existence of adequate provisions in the Code of Civil Procedure relating to institution of a suit, the present Act contains elaborate provisions as to disputes regarding elections. It not only prescribes how election petitions are to be presented but it also mandates what are the materials to be accompanied with the election petition, details regarding parties, contents of the same, relief that may be claimed in the petition. How trial of election petitions are to be conducted has been specifically provided in Chapter III of Part VI. In such circumstances, the provisions have to be interpreted as mentioned by the Legislature. One can discern the reason why the petition is required to be presented by the petitioner personally. An election petition is a serious matter with a variety of consequences. Since such a petition may lead to the vitiation of a democratic process, any procedure provided by an election statute must be read strictly. Therefore, the Legislature has provided that the petition must be presented \"by\" the petitioner himself, so that at the time of presentation, the High Court may make preliminary verification which ensure that the petition is neither frivolous nor vexatious.  1969(1) SCC 408 Distinguished.  [Para 15,16]\n\nInspite of provisions in CPC and Evidence Act relating to institution of suit and recording of evidence etc. this Act provides all the details starting from the presentation of the election petition ending with the decision of the High Court. In such circumstances, it is but proper to interpret the language used by the Legislature and implement the same accordingly. The challenge to an election is a serious matter. The object of presenting an election petition by a candidate or elector is to ensure genuineness and to curtail vexatious litigations. If we consider sub-section (1) along with the other provisions in Chapter II and III, the object and intent of the Legislature is that this provision i.e. Section 81(1) is to be strictly adhered to and complied with.  As per sub-section (1) of Section 81, election petition is to be presented by any candidate or elector relating to the election personally to the authorized officer of the High Court and failure to adhere such course would be contrary to the said provision and in that event the election petition is liable to be dismissed on the ground of improper presentation.

[Para 16]\n\nThe mere fact that the respondent is a Director of the Corporation would not make him an agent of the Corporation and as such there is no question of respondent being considered as managing agent of the Corporation.

The first parts provides that an election petition calling in question any election could be filed by a candidate or an elector within forty-five days from the date of the election of the returned candidate. The second part of Section 81 cannot apply to any election to a Legislative Assembly, but it would apply only to Legislative Council of a State or Council of States.  [Para 18,20]\n\nSection 53 of the Act provides that if the number of candidates is equal to number of seats to be filled, the Returning Officer is required to forthwith declare such candidates to be duly elected and only in the event of contest, poll would be held.  Section 66 covers those cases where poll is felt necessary and requires the Returning Officer to declare the result of the election forthwith after counting of votes.  Thus, where in the general election to the Legislative Assembly of a State on the date of scrutiny of nomination for a constituency only one candidate was in the field and was, therefore, declared as elected by the Returning Officer as per S.53, his election can be called in question only within 45 days of such declaration.  [Para 21,22]\n\nThe submission that the limitation for filing an election petition should be reckoned not with reference to the date on which the candidate whose election is challenged was declared elected, but with reference to the date on which the last candidate was declared elected at a general election would not only make the provisions cumbersome and countrary to the provisions of the Act, particularly against the scheme of amendments introduced in 1956 and 1961 but would also make the starting point of limitation uncertain, indefinite and fluctuating.  Such construction would require complete details of all returned candidates of Legislative Assembly of a State.  Moreover, where the challenge is to an election of a Member of House of People (Lok Sabha), full particulars in different constituencies throughout the country must be before the Election Tribunal (High Court).  The Tribunal also is bound to inquire into such particulars with a view to ascertaining whether the election petition filed by the petitioner is or is not within the period specified in Section 81 of the Act.  Again, in case of dispute or contest on the issue of limitation, the Election Tribunal is required to call for and inspect records of all constituencies.  Unless compelled, a Court of law would not interpret a provision in such a way which would frustrate legislative intent and make the provision unworkable and impracticable.  [Para 30]"

The issues are framed so that no party at the trial is taken by surprise. It is the issues fixed and not the pleadings that guide the parties in the matter of adducing evidence.  Therefore, it is evident that the party to the election petition must plead the material fact and substantiate its averment by adducing sufficient evidence. The court cannot travel beyond the pleadings and the issue cannot be framed unless there are pleadings to raise the controversy on a particular fact or law. It is, therefore, not permissible for the court to allow the party to lead evidence which is not in the line of the pleadings. Even if the evidence is led that is just to be ignored as the same cannot be taken into consideration.

Election petitioner has further pleaded that the result of the election stood materially affected because of improperly receiving the six tendered votes and in absence of any Recrimination Petition in the case the appellant cannot be permitted to lead evidence on the fact which is not in issue. There was no reference to other 4 tendered votes either in the petition or in the written statement. The said 4 tendered votes neither had been relied upon in the reply by the appellant nor had been tendered in the list of documents.\t [Para 27,28]"

What is prohibited is that he cannot be required to state for whom he had voted at an election. Secrecy of ballots indisputably goes to the root of democracy, but the same may not itself be a ground to refuse issue of summons to the witnesses, Section 94 of the Act merely confers a privilege upon a voter.  He may even waive his right. It is not in dispute that any person can be produced as a witness by the parties to an election petition. Witnesses so produced on behalf of the parties without any summons being issued would be at liberty to disclose in the court as to in whose favour he had exercised his right of franchise. It is, therefore, evident that the question as to whether a witness will exercise his right/privilege conferred in terms of Section 94 of the Act is a matter of volition. It is one thing to say that the civil court while issuing a summon must exercise its jurisdiction in terms of sub-rule (2) of Rule 1 of Order XVI of the Code of Civil Procedure but it is another thing to say that the court would refuse to summon the witness only because a question as regard exercise of the privilege of the witness may arise. The court may not refuse to exercise its jurisdiction only on the ground that by reason thereof the privilege of a voter may be violated.  \t\t\t\t\t [Para 12,13,14]\n\nSub-Rule 2 of Rule 1 of Order XVI of the Code of Civil Procedure indisputably requires the party to file an application for obtaining any summons for the attendance of any person stating therein the purpose therefor; but the same would not mean that the court would refuse to exercise its jurisdiction only because, one of the purposes disclosed may be that the witness may be asked a question as to in whose favour he had exercised his right of franchise. The purpose which is required to be disclosed in such an application for summoning a witness is only with a view to apprise the court as to whether the evidence which may be adduced, would be relevant for the purpose of determining the issues and not for any other purpose.   [Para 16]\n\nThe privilege against self-incrimination is to be claimed by the witness. The right becomes available, only after the witness has taken the stand and a question that offends the privilege is put to him. A prospective witness or some other person (as in the present case, cannot raise such an issue in anticipation of an apprehended breach of privilege against self-incrimination.   [Para 27]"

Thus, it is held that right to know about the candidate is a natural right flowing from the concept of democracy and is an integral part of Article 19(1) (a) of the Constitution. The ultimate purpose of filing of affidavit along with the nomination paper is to effectuate the fundamental right of the citizens under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India. The citizens are supposed to have the necessary information at the time of filing of nomination paper and for that purpose, the Returning Officer can very well compel a candidate to furnish the relevant information. Filing of affidavit with blank particulars will render the affidavit nugatory. It is the duty of the Returning Officer to check whether the information required is fully furnished at the time of filing of affidavit with the nomination paper since such information is very vital for giving effect to the 'right to know' of the citizens. If a candidate fails to fill the blanks even after the reminder by the Returning Officer, the nomination paper is fit to be rejected. The power of Returning Officer to reject the nomination paper must be exercised very sparingly but the bar should not be laid so high that the justice itself is prejudiced. The candidate must take the minimum effort to explicitly remark as 'NIL' or 'Not Applicable' or 'Not known' in the columns and not to leave the particulars blank. Filing of affidavit with blanks will be directly hit by Section 125A(i) of the RP Act However, as the nomination paper itself is rejected by the Returning Officer, there is no reason why the candidate must be again penalized for the same act by prosecuting him/her.\n(2003) 4 SCC 399 Explained.

                "description": "Election - Non-disclosure of information - Non-disclosure about Government dues, of bungalow in name of spouse and outstanding taxes of vehicle owned by wife, of property purchased in name of firm - Stage at which nomination paper can be rejected on ground of non-disclosure of information in affidavit. \n\nThe citizens have fundamental right under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India to know about the candidates contesting the elections and this is the primary reason that casts a solemn obligation on these candidates to furnish information regarding the criminal antecedents, educational qualifications and assets held by the candidate, his spouse and dependent children. It is on that basis that not only Election Commission has issued guidelines, but also prepared formats in which the affidavits are to be filed. As a fortiorari, it follows that if the required information as per the said format in respect of the assets of the candidate, his wife and dependent children is not given, it would amount to suppression/non-disclosure.      \n\nWhen the information is given by a candidate in the affidavit filed along with the nomination paper and objections are raised thereto questioning the correctness of the information or alleging that there is non-disclosure of certain important information, it may not be possible for the returning officer at that time to conduct a detailed examination. Summary enquiry may not suffice. Present case is itself an example which loudly demonstrates this. At the same time, it would not be possible for the Returning Officer to reject the nomination for want of verification about the allegations made by the objector. In such a case, when ultimately it is proved that it was a case of non-disclosure and either the affidavit was false or it did not contain complete information leading to suppression, it can be held at that stage that the nomination was improperly accepted. The grounds stated in Section 36(2) are those which can be examined there and then and on that basis the Returning Officer would be in a position to reject the nomination. Likewise, where the blanks are left in an affidavit, nomination can be rejected there and then. In other cases where detailed enquiry is needed, it would depend upon the outcome thereof, in an election petition, as to whether the nomination was properly accepted or it was a case of improper acceptance. Once it is found that it was a case of improper acceptance, as there was misinformation or suppression of material information, one can state that question of rejection in such a case was only deferred to a later date. When the Court gives such a finding, which would have resulted in rejection, the effect would be same, namely, such a candidate was not entitled to contest and the election is void. Otherwise, it would be an anomalous situation that even when criminal proceedings under Section 125A of the Act can be initiated and the selected candidate is criminally prosecuted and convicted, but the result of his election cannot be questioned. This cannot be countenanced.\t\t     [Para 38]\n\nInsofar as non-disclosure of the electricity dues is concerned, in the given facts of the case, it may not be a serious lapse. No doubt, the dues were outstanding, at the same time, there was a bona fide dispute about the outstanding dues in respect of the first electricity meter. When the appellant nurtured belief in a bona fide manner that because of the said dispute he is not to give the information about the outstanding amount, as it had not become 'payable', this should not be treated as a material lapse. Likewise, as far as the second electricity meter is concerned, it was in the premises which was rented out to the tenants and the dues were payable by the tenants in the first instance. Again, in such circumstances, one can bona fide believe that the tenants would pay the outstanding amount. No doubt, if the tenants do not pay the amount the liability would have been that of the owner, i.e. the appellant. However, at the time of filing the nomination, the appellant could not presume that the tenants would not pay the amount and, therefore, it had become his liability. Same is the position with regard to non-payment of a sum of Rs.1,783/- as outstanding municipal dues, where there was a genuine dispute as to revaluation and reassessment for the purpose of assessing the taxes was yet to be undertaken. It would depend in the facts and circumstances of each case as to whether such a non-disclosure would amount to material lapse or not. Even if it is so, in respect of the aforesaid aspects, on other nondisclosures, the case of the appellant has to fail. It is clear case of non-disclosure of bungalow in the name of the appellant's wife, which is a substantial lapse. So is the case about the nondisclosure of vehicle in the name of appellant's wife. Likewise, nondisclosure of the appellant's interest/share in the partnership firm is a very serious and major lapse. On all these aspects, the defence/explanation furnished by the appellant does not inspire any confidence. It is simply an afterthought attempt to wriggle out of the material lapse on the part of the appellant in not disclosing the required information, which was substantial. In the affidavits given by the appellant along with the nomination form, material information about the assets was not disclosed and, therefore, it is not possible to accept the argument of the appellant that information contained in the affidavits be treated as sufficient/substantial compliance.

The continuance of any member in such bodies who secured his election to such a body by legally impermissible means even for a day is most undesirable. Such continuance affords an opportunity to such a member to take part in the law making process affecting the destinies of the people.\n\n Even from the point of view of the contesting candidates, unless the rights and the obligations are decided within a reasonable time, the adjudication and the consequences of the adjudication may eventually remain on paper without any tangible effect insofar as the participation of such parties in the legislative process. \t\t\t    [Para 12]\n\nThe stakes are very high for the parties. Nothing short of the membership of a constitutional body for a limited period. The power and glory that go with such membership is too high and valuable and the returned candidates naturally leave no stone unturned for protracting the litigation as long as possible.\n\nThe law of elections and election disputes is highly technical. Therefore, there is always scope for lot of objections and cross-objections regarding every step in the conduct of the election petition.\n\n The absence of dedicated Benches in the High Court for resolution of the election disputes is another factor which contributes enormously to the delay in the adjudicatory process. \n\nIt is not possible for laying down any absolute rules in this regard. Essentially it is for a Chief Justice of the High Court to run the administration and devise ways and means for expeditiously disposing of the cases brought before the High Court. The kind of delay in the adjudication of election disputes exposes the High Court's unpleasant criticism damaging the credibility of the institution.

The issue is one of fact and the onus of proving it lies upon the petitioner.\n\n3. \tThe burden of proving such material effect has to be discharged by the election petitioner by adducing positive, satisfactory and cogent evidence. If the petitioner is unable to adduce such evidence the burden is not discharged and the election must stand. This rule may operate harshly upon the petitioner seeking to set aside the election on the ground of improper acceptance of a nomination paper, but the Court is not concerned with the inconvenience result ing from the operation of the law. Difficulty of proof cannot obviate the need of strict proof or relax the rigour of required proof.\n\n4. \tThe burden of proof placed on the election petitioner is very strict and so difficult to discharge as nearing almost an impossibility. There is no room for any-guesswork, speculation, surmises or conjectures i.e. acting on a mere possibility. It will not suffice merely to say that all or majority of wasted votes might have gone to the next highest candidate. The law requires proof. How far that proof should go or what it should contain is not provided by the legislature.\n\n5. \tThe casting of votes at an election depends upon a variety of factors and it is not possible for any one to predicate how many or which proportion of the votes will go to one or the other of the candidates. It is not permissible to accept the 'ipse dixit' of witness coming from one side or the other to say that all or some of the votes would have gone to one or the other on some supposed or imaginary ground.\t\t\t [Para 16]"

It mandates in the first instance furnishing as many copies of the petition as there are respondents mentioned in the petition. Further the copy to be furnished should be so true that nobody can by any possibility misunderstand it or get misled. A true copy means a copy which is wholly and substantially the same as original. When the copy served contains clerical or typing mistakes which are of no consequences, then the same cannot be regarded as lethal flaws warranting dismissal of the petition. But if the copy contains important omissions and substantial variance, then it would amount to non-compliance of the statutory provisions. It is also accepted principle in the context of dispute pertaining to the election under the provisions of the said Act that the concept of substantial compliance cannot be extended so far as to include serious or vital mistakes which shed the character of true copy.\n\n1996(2) ALL MR 246  Relied on.  [Para 48]\n\nIn this case there is variance between the description of the affirming authority mentioned in the copy accompanying the petition and that which appears in the original. In that, in the original it is shown that the affirmation has been done before the Second Assistant Master, High Court Bombay, whereas the copy furnished to the 1st respondent shows that affirmation in fact has been done before the Associate High Court Bombay. This would clearly show that while furnishing the copy of the petition and the accompanying affidavit to the petition no care was taken for proper and due compliance of the statutory provisions. In any event such mistakes cannot be said and regarded as being trivial and inconsequential. The proper description of the authority before whom the affidavit or for that matter the petition are verified is must so that the opposite party to whom the copy thereof is served would know what is the real and true position. In any event the Statute makes it imperative that copy of the petition to be served upon the opposite party has to be true copy. The statute also requires the due and proper attestation of each copies and this is done to ensure that copy of the petition furnished and served to the opposite party is a real and true copy in a sense as is contemplated by the Statute.\n\nAIR  1955  SC   610   Distinguished.

True copy implies that the copy furnished must be the exact true copy of the original. The omission of conveying the authority before whom the affidavit has been affirmed in a copy of affidavit furnished is a most vital part of the affidavit and copy of affidavit with such omission cannot be said to be a true copy of the original affidavit.

Section 52, after its substitution by Act 21 of 1996, takes cognizance of a death of a candidate of the recognized political party before poll and not the other two categories of the candidates classified in Section 38, namely (one) candidates of registered political parties other than the candidates of recognized political parties and (two) other candidates (which includes independent candidates). Thus, the electoral law as enacted in 1951 Act does not contemplate cognizance of the death of an independent candidate after publication of list of contesting candidates in Section 38. Section 52 enjoins that if a candidate set up by recognized political party dies before the poll, the poll must be adjourned; it does not provide any obligation on the returning officer if a candidate of a registered political party other than recognized political party or an independent candidate dies after the list of the contesting candidates as defined in Section 38 is published.

Order 23, Rule 1, gives absolute right to the plaintiff to withdraw. Section 109 of the Act, does not, and that is because an election petition is seen as a matter not only between candidates who contested the election against each other but also the voters of the constituency who also have a substantial interest in an election petition as an election is an essential part of democratic process. That is why the right to withdraw is circumscribed.

Sub-Section (1) provides that subject to such conditions and limitations as may be prescribed, and to the provisions of any law for the time being in force, the costs of and incident to all suits shall be in the discretion of the Court, and the Court shall have full power to determine by whom or out of what property and to what extent such costs are to be paid, and to give all necessary directions for the purposes aforesaid. The fact that the Court has no jurisdiction to try the suit shall be no bar to the exercise of such powers. Sub-Section (2) provides that where the Court directs that any costs shall not follow the event, the Court shall state its reasons in writing.\n\nSection 119 of the Act also deals with costs. That again is another special provision made in the Act. It states that the costs shall be in the discretion of the High Court:\n\nProvided that where a petition is dismissed under clause (a) of section 98, the returned candidate shall be entitled to the costs incurred by him in contesting the petition and accordingly the High Court shall make an order for costs in favour of the returned candidate.\n\nNo doubt, the administration of justice is the sovereign function of the State but the State does incur lot of expenditure of public money for maintenance of Courts, by way of salary of Judges, staff, buildings, stationery, electricity, water, etc. State is run by taxes paid by the citizens.

AIR 2002 SC 599 - Followed.\n\nThe pleadings in the petition must establish that errors are of such magnitude that they materially affect the election.  The allegation that the counting of votes was done very fast is a totally vague allegation.  Also allegation that the central observer had failed to recount 2 EVM machines is equally vague as such complaint was expressly rejected by the returning officer even before declaration of results.  Moreover no case is made out to show as to how such error committed has affected the election.  Allegations made that reasons for not recounting votes only communicated orally and not recorded by returning officer.  How it has affected election is not pleaded.  It is also alleged that there is discrepancy in votes in the working sheets lying with the petitioner and official counting sheets.  Such discrepancy if at all was there would have been noticed at the time of counting.  Apart from that in such case total number of votes polled in constituency in question would not have tallied at all.  There are also allegations that there is difference of 329 votes in votes polled and votes counted.  There was no bogus voting, allegations not made before declaring result, said difference did not reflect in final result and further more respondent no.1 won by margin of 2933 votes hence this did not affect his election.  Reasons seeking recounting of votes are vague, frivolous and are intended to delay trial.  These allegations in paragraph 11 are liable to be deleted.\t\t\t\t\t [Para 24,25,28,29]"

This is clear from the plain language of sub-section (3) and this is the only manner in which the word 'his' used therein can be construed. When the appeal is to vote on the ground of 'his' religion for the furtherance of the prospects of the election of that candidate, that appeal is made on the basis of the religion of the candidate for whom votes are solicited. On the other hand, when the appeal is to refrain from voting for any person on the ground of 'his' religion for prejudicially affecting the election of any candidate, that appeal is based on the religion of the candidate whose election is sought to be prejudicially affected. Thus, for soliciting votes for a candidate, the appeal prohibited is that which is made on the ground of religion of the candidate for whom the votes are sought; and when the appeal is to refrain from voting for any candidate, the prohibition is against an appeal on the ground of the religion of that other candidate. The first is a positive appeal and the second a negative appeal.

The underlying object of the rule is to ensure that every party to a suit should present his pleading in an intelligible form without causing embarrassment to his adversary. Since the general principles as to pleadings in civil suits apply to election petitions as well, the pleadings which are required to be struck off under Rule 16 of Order VI in a suit can also be ordered to be struck off in an election petition. In appropriate cases, therefore, an election tribunal (High Court) may invoke the power under Order VI, Rule 16 of the Code. \t\t\t\t\t  [Para 22,23]\n\nAt the same time, however, it cannot be overlooked that normally a Court cannot direct parties as to how they should prepare their pleadings.

In other words, even though Section 86(1) makes no reference to Section 83(1)(a) as such, even so, the Election Petition, if it fails to set forth \"all the material facts\" on which the Petitioner relies so as to disclose the cause of action, such Petition will have to be thrown out at the threshold. That power is not only to be exercised with reference to Section 86(1) of the Act, but also flows from provisions of Order VII, Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as 'the Code'), which obligates the Court to throw out the Petition at the threshold if the same does not disclose cause of action.

                "description": "Election - Petition for declaration of as void - Ground of corrupt practices like filing false or incorrect affidavit before Returning Officer - No plea in petition that respondent was disqualified for said seat or that he was convicted of any offence - None of the averments disclosing relevant material facts to constitute cause of action for invoking ground of corrupt practices - Petition hence liable to be dismissed - Pleadings regarding alleged ground of corrupt practices struck off the records.\n\nSection 100(1)(d) refers to four situations. The first is of improper acceptance of any nomination. Even on construing allegations in the Petition liberally, it is not possible to assume that the ground under clause (i) has been invoked in the context of allegation of filing of false affidavit by the Respondent before the Returning Officer. The fourth clause provided in Section 100(1)(d) refers to non-compliance of the provisions of the Constitution or of the Act of 1951 or of any rules or orders made under that Act. To invoke this ground, however, what is required to be alleged is that the result of the election insofar as it concerns the returned candidate has been materially affected by such act-whether referable to clause (i) or clause (iv) in Section 100(1)(d). The ground provided in Section 100(1) (a) provides that on the date of election of the returned candidate, he was not qualified or was disqualified to be chosen to fill the seat under the Constitution or the Act of 1951 or the Government of Union Territories Act, 1963. The qualification to be elected as member of the Legislative Assembly of the State is provided by the Constitution under Article 173. It is not the case of the Election Petitioner that the Respondent was a person not qualified to be chosen to fill a seat in the Legislature of a State, having failed to fulfil any of the qualifications referred to in Article 173 of the Constitution. Insofar as Act of 1951 is concerned, Section 5 provides for qualifications of membership of a Legislative Assembly.  In the instant case nowhere in the Petition, it is even remotely suggested that the Respondent was not qualified within the meaning of the said provision. Similarly, in the entire Petition, it is nowhere the case of the Petitioner that the Respondent was disqualified to be chosen to fill the seat under any of the provisions of the Constitution or the Act of 1951. It is not the case of the Petitioner that the Respondent has been convicted for any of the specified offences under that provision. The Petitioner asserts that criminal case for offence punishable under Section 125-A of the Act has been registered against the Respondent. That, however, is not sufficient to disqualify Respondent on the date of his election on which he was declared a returned candidate. The disqualification, if at all, will be incurred after the criminal case ends in conviction. Besides, Section 125-A of the Act is not part of the several specified offences under Section 8.  In other words, Section 125-A which deals with penalty for filing false affidavit has not been specified as offence for the purpose of disqualification. In none of the paragraphs in the petition, all the relevant material facts have been disclosed to constitute cause of action for invoking ground under Section 100(1)(d), clause (i) or clause (iv). The consequence is that, the Petition as filed is not a complete Election Petition within the meaning of Section 83(1)(a) of the Act, for which reason, will have to be dismissed under Section 86(1) of the Act read with provisions of Order VII, Rule 11 of the Code, as it fails to disclose cause of action.   [Para 9,11,25]\n\nSection 100(1)(b) provides that if the High Court is of the opinion that any corrupt practice has been committed by a returned candidate or his election agent or by any other person with the consent of the returned candidate or his election agent, may declare the election of the returned candidate to be void. Insofar as Section 100(1)(d)(ii) is concerned, that is a ground available for declaring the election of the returned candidate to be void if the High Court is of the opinion that the result of the election insofar as it concerns the returned candidate has been materially affected by any corrupt practice committed in the interests of the returned candidate by an agent other than his election agent.   [Para 27]\n\nThe Petition as a whole, the alleged corrupt practice stated by the Petitioner in these Paragraphs, all relevant material facts to disclose cause of action therefor are not mentioned in the Petition. The averments are short of statement of all relevant material facts to disclose cause of action to pursue the ground in question for declaring the election of Respondent as void. Accordingly, the Petition should fail and will have to be dismissed at threshold in exercise of powers under Section 86(1) read with Order VII, Rule 11 of the Code. In any case, this Court will have to strike off these pleadings regarding the ground pressed into service by the Petitioner in question being unnecessary, frivolous and vexatious, which may tend to prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial. In the circumstances, it will have to be held that the Petition lacks complete material facts to disclose cause of action with regard to the alleged corrupt practice. As a consequence, the Petition deserves to be thrown out at the threshold in exercise of Section 86(1) read with Order VII, Rule 11 of the Code. In any case, the pleadings in respect of stated corrupt practice will have to be struck out from the pleadings being unnecessary, frivolous and vexatious, which may tend to prejudice, embarrass or delay the fair trial.

In so far as the case of a candidate seeking to contest the election, if such candidate has been convicted, no provision has been made  whereby a candidate who has been convicted even if he is granted Bail, can contest the election. This seems to be because the right to contest the election is a statutory right. By statute, Parliament has conferred the right to contest to a determinate class of citizens. That class of citizens is a class which has not incurred any disqualification on the date of filing the nomination or till the date of election. Long back, it seems to have been the intent of Parliament to keep certain felons from entering Parliament or the Legislatures. On the other hand in the case where a person has been convicted during his term of office, the conviction per se does not disqualify such a person form holding an office as the Act itself provides that the disqualification will not come into effect until three months have elapsed from the date of conviction or if appeal or application or revision is filed in respect of the conviction and sentence until that appeal or application is disposed of by the Court. The case of returned candidate therefore has been treated differently. Mere filing of an appeal by itself suspends the incurring of the disqualification, if any, till the appeal or application is disposed of. It is therefore, clear that parliament itself has made a clear distinction in respect of the two classes of cases. A perusal of offences which incur disqualification as set out in sub-section (1) of Section 8 or sub-section (2), it would be clear that they pertain to a class or category of offences which are offences relating to public order or morality or the interest of the State.\t\t\t\t\t [Para 11]"

In other words, unless and until the election petitioner comes forward with a definite plea of his case that the allegation of corrupt practice is supported by legally acceptable material evidence without an iota of doubt as to such allegation, the Election Petition cannot be entertained and will have to be rejected at the threshold. It will be relevant to state that since the successful candidate in an election has got the support of the majority of the voters who cast their votes in his favour, the success gained by a candidate in a public election cannot be allowed to be called in question by any unsuccessful candidate by making frivolous or baseless allegations and thereby unnecessarily drag the successful candidate to the Court proceedings and make waste of his precious time, which would have otherwise been devoted for the welfare of the members of his constituency.

Criminal activities that result in disqualification are related to various spheres pertaining to the interest of the nation, common citizenry interest, communal harmony, and prevalence of good governance. It is clear that the 1951 Act lays down that the commission of serious criminal offences renders a person ineligible to contest in elections or continue as a representative of the people.

On the other hand, if the improper acceptance of nomination is of the returned candidate, there is no necessity of proof that the election has been materially affected as the returned candidate would not have been able to contest the election if his nomination was not accepted.

Sub-section (3) of Section 77 provides that the total of the said expenditure shall not exceed such amount as may be prescribed. The expression \"prescribed\" has been defined in Section 2(h) to mean prescribed by the rules made under the Act. Under Section 123(6) of the Act incurring excessive expenditure than the maximum amount prescribed, would tantamount to corrupt practice. But the said expenditure has to be incurred either by the candidate or by his election agent or by a person authorized by him and further such expenditure must be between the date of publication of the notification calling the election and the date of declaration of the result thereof. Explanation (1) to Section 77 in the context of expenditure incurred or authorised by the candidate bears considerable significance inasmuch as voluntary expenditure incurred by friends, relations or sympathisers of the candidate is not required to be included in the candidate's return of expenses unless expenses were incurred in the circumstances from which it could be positively inferred that the successful candidate had undertaken that he would reimburse the person, who incurred the expenses. When maintainability of an election petition is considered from the stand point as to whether material facts have been pleaded or not in a petition alleging corrupt practice on the ground that expenses incurred by the candidate is more than the prescribed limit, it would be necessary to aver the fact that the candidate has incurred the expenditure or has authorised any other person to incur the expenditure or that his election agent has incurred the expenditure and further the candidate has undertaken the liability to reimburse. These would constitute the material facts of an election petition, which is filed, alleging corrupt practice within the ambit of Section 123(6) read with Section 77 of the Act and Rule 90 of the Conduct of Election Rules.

It would have been better if the document required to be filed with the nomination paper and not so filed was produced before the returning officer at the time of scrutiny because in that case the production would have been in the presence of all those who might have chosen to remain present at the time of scrutiny and that would have avoided insinuations being hurled at the returning officer and/or the returned candidate as is being done in the case at hand. But that does not mean that the document made available to the returning officer before the time of scrutiny cannot be looked into by him at the time of scrutiny for the purpose of satisfying himself of the compliance by a candidate with Section 33(5) of the Act. It is possible and permissible for the candidates to demand and inspect the nomination papers of their rivals and the Returning Officer is under an obligation to enable them to do so. Thus, there is no great sanctity in producing the Electoral Roll only at the time of scrutiny.  [Para 37]"

Lokur & L.N. Rao, JJ. :- Keeping in view the social context in which sub-section (3) of Section 123 of the Act was enacted and today's social and technological context, it is absolutely necessary to give a purposive interpretation to the provision rather than a literal or strict interpretation. To the extent that this Court has limited the scope of Section 123(3) of the Act in Jagdev Singh Sidhanti (1964) 6 SCR 750, Kanti Prasad Jayshanker Yagnik (1969) 1 SCC 455 and Ramesh Yeshwant Prabhoo (1996) 1 SCC 130, to an appeal based on the religion of the candidate or the rival candidate(s), we are not in agreement with the view expressed in these decisions. We have nothing to say with regard to an appeal concerning the conservation of language dealt with in Jagdev Singh Sidhanti. That issue does not arise for our consideration. (1964) 6 SCR 750, (1969) 1 SCC 455, (1996) 1 SCC 130 Disapproved. [Para 46]\n\nSub-section (3) of Section 123 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 must be given a broad and purposive interpretation thereby bringing within the sweep of a corrupt practice any appeal made to an elector by a candidate or his agent or by any other person with the consent of a candidate or his election agent to vote or refrain from voting for the furtherance of the prospects of the election of that candidate or for prejudicially affecting the election of any candidate on the ground of the religion, race, caste, community or language of (i) any candidate or (ii) his agent or (iii) any other person making the appeal with the consent of the candidate or (iv) the elector. It is a matter of evidence for determining whether an appeal has at all been made to an elector and whether the appeal if made is in violation of the provisions of sub-section (3) of Section 123 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951.\t [Para 49]\n\nS.A. Bobde, J. (Concurring) :- I agree with the conclusion drawn by my learned brother Lokur, J. that the bar under Section 123 (3) of the Representation of People Act, 1951 to making an appeal on the ground of religion must not be confined to the religion of the candidate because of the word 'his' in that provision. I also agree that the purposive interpretation in the social context adjudication as a facet of purposive interpretation warrants a broad interpretation of that section. I would, however, add that such a construction is not only warranted upon the application of the purposive test of interpretation but also on textual interpretation. A literal interpretation does not exclude a purposive interpretation of the provisions whether in relation to a taxing statute or a penal statute.\t [Para 51,52]\n\nThe provision prohibits an \"appeal by a candidate\", etc. \"to vote or refrain from voting for any person on the ground of his religion\", etc. The word \"his\" therefore must necessarily be taken to embrace the entire transaction of the appeal to vote made to voters and must be held referable to all the actors involved i.e. the candidate, his election agent etc. and the voter. Thus, the pronoun in the singular \"his\" refers to a candidate or his agent or any other person with the consent of a candidate or his election agent and to the voter. In other words, what is prohibited is an appeal by a candidate etc. to a voter for voting on the ground of his religion i.e. those categories preceding \"his\". This construction is fortified by the purposive test. Accordingly, the words \"his religion\" must be construed as referring to all the categories of persons preceding these words.\t [Para 53,58]\n\nT.S. Thakur, C.J.I. (Concurring) :- The view taken by Lokur, J. appears to me to be more in tune with the purpose and intention behind the enactment of Section 123(3) of the Representation of Peoples Act, 1951. I would, therefore, concur with the conclusions drawn by Lokur, J. and the order proposed by His Lordship.\t [Para 59]\n\nSection 123(3), as it appears, in the Statute Book is capable of two possible interpretations one suggesting that a corrupt practice will be committed only if the appeal is in the name of the candidate's religion, race, community or language and the other suggesting that regardless of whose religion, race, community or language is invoked an appeal in the name of any one of those would vitiate the election. The question is which one of the two interpretations ought to be preferred by the Court keeping in view the constitutional ethos and the secular character of our polity.\n\nOne can say that if two constructions of a statute were possible, one that promotes the constitutional objective ought to be preferred over the other that does not do so. Applying that principle to the case at hand, an interpretation that will have the effect of removing the religion or religious considerations from the secular character of the State or state activity ought to be preferred over an interpretation which may allow such considerations to enter, effect or influence such activities.\n\nThe sum total of Section 123 (3) even after amendment is that an appeal in the name of religion, race, caste, community or language is forbidden even when the appeal may not be in the name of the religion, race, caste, community or language of the candidate for whom it has been made.\t [Para 68,83,86,87]\n\nDr. D.Y. Chandrachud, A.K. Goel & U.U. Lalit, JJ. (Dissenting) :- Election petitions alleging corrupt practices have a quasi-criminal character. Where a statutory provision implicates penal consequences or consequences of a quasi-criminal character, a strict construction of the words used by the legislature must be adopted.\t [Para 98]\n\nThe expression \"his\" used in conjunction with religion, race, caste, community or language is in reference to the religion, race, caste, community or language of the candidate (in whose favour the appeal to cast a vote is made) or that of a rival candidate (when an appeal is made to refrain from voting for another). It is impossible to construe sub-section (3) as referring to the religion, race, caste, community or language of the voter. The provision, it is significant, adverts to \"a candidate\" or \"his agent\", or \"by any other person with the consent of a candidate or his election agent\". This is a reference to the person making the appeal. The next part of the provision contains a reference to the appeal being made \"to vote or refrain from voting for any person\". The vote is solicited for a candidate or there is an appeal not to vote for a candidate. Each of these expressions is in the singular. They are followed by expression \"on the ground of his religion...\". The expression \"his religion...\" must necessarily qualify what precedes; namely, the religion of the candidate in whose favour a vote is sought or that of another candidate against whom there is an appeal to refrain from voting. 'His' religion (and the same principle would apply to 'his' race, 'his' caste, 'his' community, or 'his' language) must hence refer to the religion of the person in whose favour votes are solicited or the person against whom there is an appeal for refraining from casting a ballot.\t [Para 102]\n\nSection 123(3) uses the expression \"on the ground of his religion...\". There are two significant expressions here (besides 'his'). The first is 'the' and the second, \"ground\". The expression 'the' is a definite article used especially before a noun with a specifying or particularizing effect. 'The' is used as opposed to the indefinite or generalizing forces of the indefinite article 'a' or 'an'. The expression 'ground' was substituted in Section 123(3) in place of 'grounds', following the amendment of 1961. Read together, the words \"the ground of his religion...\" indicate that what the legislature has proscribed is an appeal to vote for a candidate or to refrain from voting for another candidate exclusively on the basis of the religion (or race, caste, community or language) of the candidate or a rival candidate.

Thakur, C.J.I. : The unamended provision of Section 123(3) made any appeal in the name of religion, race, caste, community or language a corrupt practice regardless of whose religion, race, caste, community or language was involved for such an appeal. The only other requirement was that such an appeal was made in a systematic manner for the furtherance of the prospects of a candidate. If that was the legal position before the amendment and if the Parliament intended to enlarge the scope of the corrupt practice as indeed it did, the question of the scope being widened and restricted at the same time did not arise. There is nothing to suggest either in the statement of objects and reasons or contemporaneous record of proceedings including notes accompanying the bill to show that the amendment was contrary to the earlier position intended to permit appeals in the name of religion, race, caste, community or language to be made except those made in the name of the religion, race, caste, community or language of the candidate for the furtherance of whose prospects such appeals were made. Any such interpretation will not only do violence to the provisions of Section 123(3) but also go against the avowed purpose of the amendment. Any such interpretation will artificially restrict the scope of corrupt practice for it will make permissible what was clearly impermissible under the unamended provision.\t [Para 67]\n\nDr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J. (Dissenting) :- The legislative history indicates that Parliament, while omitting the requirement of a \"systematic\" appeal intended to widen the ambit of the provision. An 'appeal' is not hedged in by the restrictive requirements, evidentiary and substantive, associated with the expression \"systematic appeal\". 'Language' was introduced as an additional ground as well. However, it would not be correct as a principle of interpretation to hold that if the expression \"his\" religion is used to refer to the religion of a candidate, the legislature would be constraining the width of the provision even beyond its pre-amended avatar.\n\nWhen Parliament expanded the ambit of Section 123(3) in 1961, it was entitled to determine the extent to which the provision should be widened. Parliament would be mindful of the consequence of an unrestrainedexpansion of the ambit of Section 123(3). Parliament is entitled to perceive, in the best interest of democratic political discourse and bearing in mind the fundamental right to free speech and expression that what should be proscribed should only be an appeal to the religion, race, caste, community or language of the candidate or of a rival candidate. For, if the provision is construed to apply to the religion of the voter, this would result in a situation where persons contesting an election would run the risk of engaging in a corrupt practice if the discourse during the course of a campaign dwells on injustices suffered by a segment of the population on the basis of caste, race, community or language. Parliament did not intend its amendment to lead to such a drastic consequence. In making that legislative judgment, Parliament cannot be faulted. The extent to which a legislative provision, particularly one of a quasi-criminal character, should be widened lies in the legislative wisdom of the enacting body. While expanding the width of the erstwhile provision, Parliament was legitimately entitled to define its boundaries. The incorporation of the word \"his\" achieves just that purpose. \t  [Para 123]"

This has to be by a candidate or by any person with the consent of the candidate. The purpose is to further the election of the candidate or to prejudicially affect the election of a candidate. Section 123(3A) does not refer to the religion, race, caste, community or language of a candidate or of a rival candidate (unlike Section 123(3) which uses the expression \"his\"). Section 123(3A) refers to the promotion of or attempts to promote feelings of enmity or hatred between different classes of the citizens of India on grounds of religion, race, caste, community or language. Section 123(3A) cannot be telescoped into Section 123(3). The legislature has carefully drafted Section 123(3) to reach out to a particular corrupt practice, which is even more evident when the ambit of Section 123(3A) is contrasted with Section 123(3). One cannot be read into the other nor can the text of Section 123(3) be widened on the basis of a purposive interpretation.\t [Para 132]"

Improper rejection of a nomination, on a plain reading of the aforementioned provision, in our opinion, would not mean that for the said purpose an election petitioner can only show an error in the decision making process by a Returning Officer but also the correctness of the said decision. Indisputably, there exists a distinction between a decision making process adopted by a statutory authority and the merit of the decision. Whereas in the former, the court would apply the standard of judicial review, in the latter, it may enter into the merit of the matter. Even in applying the standard of judicial review, we are of the opinion that the scope thereof having been expanded in recent times, viz., other than, (i) illegality, (ii) irrationality and (iii) procedural impropriety, an error of fact touching the merit of the decision vis-a-vis the decision making process would also come within the purview of the power of judicial review.  2005(5) ALL MR (S.C.) 439, (2006)3 SCC 208, 2009(6) SCALE 49 - Rel.on.

Improper rejection of nomination paper, in the instant case, may lead a party not to enter into the fray of elections. It is also now a trite law that once a finding is arrived at by the Election Tribunal that the order of rejecting the nomination was improper which would take within its umbrage not only the decision making process but also the merit of the decision, no further question is required to be gone into.

[Para 29,30,31]\n\nIn this case before the returning officer, two sets of signatures were available. He could not have, on his own showing, arrived at any conclusion on that basis, particularly when prima facie he did not find the signatures of the concerned proposers to be discrepant on the basis of the naked eye comparison of their admitted signatures and the ones appearing in the registers of the Municipal Council. While, he proceeded on the basis that the said proposers were appearing before him and filed their affidavits, indisputably affidavits had not only been filed by five others including the appellant but also by the brother of the proposer No.8. The evidence before the returning officer, therefore, was by way of affidavits affirmed by the parties. Appellant not only affirmed an affidavit denying and disputing the contents filed by the said proposers but also brought on record the affidavits filed by other proposes who testified to the effect that they had signed in their presence. Even the returning officer, ex facie, did not find any difference in their signatures in the nomination paper and signatures contained in the attendance sheets of Mangalwedha Municipal Council. The presumption of correctness of the nomination paper being statutory in nature, if somebody had filed an improper nomination, but for which he can be given benefit of doubt being a possible subject matter of an election petition where the question would be gone into in details, it was for the respondent herein to prove that the nomination paper prima facie did not contain the signatures of the proposers and, thus, were liable to be rejected. A quasi-judicial authority while deciding an issue of fact may not insist upon a conclusive proof. While doing so, he has to form a prima facie view. Indisputably, however, in terms of sub-section (5) of Section 36 in Handbook for Returning Officers, if any objection is raised then while holding the summary inquiry in the matter of taking a decision on the objection as to whether the same is valid or not, he is not only required to record his brief decision for the same but further in case of doubt the benefit must go to the candidate and the nomination paper should be held to be valid although his view may be prima facie a plausible view or otherwise bona fide.

This stands in contra distinction to Section 100(1)(b) which provides that election of a returned candidate shall be declared to be void if corrupt practice has been committed by a returned candidate or his election agent or by any other person with his consent or with the consent of the returned candidate or his election agent.

This attempt undeniably and undisputedly is undue influence and, therefore, amounts to corrupt practice. If a candidate gives all the particulars and despite that he secures the votes that will be an informed, advised and free exercise of right by the electorate. That is why there is a distinction between a disqualification and the corrupt practice. In an election petition, the election petitioner is required to assert about the cases in which the successful candidate is involved as per the rules and how there has been non-disclosure in the affidavit. Once that is established, it would amount to corrupt practice. It has to be determined in an election petition by the Election Tribunal.      [Para 83]"

Whether a copy is a true copy or not it will have to be ascertained looking to the purpose for which the provision is made.

Merely because pages of the copy of the petition served on the respondent do not bear the signature of the Additional Registrar, it cannot be said to be a \"fatal defect\".  In the absence of such a signature, though the stamp of the Additional Registrar is there with the remark \"Sd\" and on every verification and even on the copy of petition supplied to the respondent the name of the Additional Registrar is written, there was hardly any occasion for the respondent to get misled.  Therefore, the impression of stamp on all the pages and the writing of the name along with the stamp of the officer concerned on every page of verification was sufficient enough to give an idea to the respondent of the name of the officer concerned before whom the petitioner signed the copies as true copies.  It is pertinent to note that there is no defect as regards the signature of the petitioner on each and every page along with the annexures and verification therewith.  The petitioner has signed on each and every page in token of it being a \"true copy\".

Act. Therefore, such declarations can be given by the Court only if it is proved that a corrupt practice has been committed. This obliges the election petitioner to plead and prove the class of corrupt practice specified in section 123 of the R.P. Act. If the corrupt practice is not pleaded and proved, then, the question of court declaring the election void on the ground set out in section 100 of R.P. Act does not arise at all. It is only on the pleading of corrupt practice, that the court holds the trial and gives an opportunity to the election petitioner to prove his allegation as pleaded. Pleading is the foundation on which the evidence will be led by the election petitioner. Proof has to be furnished of corrupt practice. The opportunity to furnish proof by leading oral and documentary evidence need not be given in the absence of a pleading of corrupt practice.

The criticism of the manifesto of the party and the manifesto making an appeal to the minority community to vote for the candidates of INC was alone made the foundation of corrupt practice. This is not a pleading which would meet the requirement of section 123(3) of the R.P. Act. It is not the case of the Petitioner that the appeal in the manifesto of INC is reiterated by the returned candidate or his agent or any person with the consent of the returned candidate or his agent. The appeal in the Manifesto by itself without anything more, cannot be equated with an appeal to vote or refrain from voting for any person on the ground of his religion within the meaning of section 123(3) of R.P. Act. The returned candidate may have contested the election as a candidate of INC on the basis of this Manifesto and the programme so also the policies set out therein. However mere use of this Manifesto by him for seeking votes without the other ingredients of section 123(3) being attracted cannot be a corrupt practice at the elections. It is very difficult to conclude on the basis of such pleading that any case of corrupt practice has been made out even prima facie.

The fact that a candidate obtains a certificate that he belonged to and is a member of the Scheduled Caste/Tribe to contest as one belonging to such caste/tribe, essential and necessary for contesting as a candidate in a Reserved Constituency, at any rate, cannot amount to an appeal to vote or refrain from voting on ground of his caste/Tribe for the reason that what was obligated by the statute upon any one to be entitled to contest in such a reserved constituency cannot become condemnable as \"corrupt practice.\" To attract the vice of the said provisions as amounting to \"corrupt practice,\" independent appeal or canvassing for votes by the candidate or his agent or by another person with the consent of the candidate or the election agent for the furtherance of the prospects of the election of that candidate or for prejudicially affecting the election of any candidate is an essential ingredient.

Audio and video tape technology has emerged as a powerful medium through which a first hand information about an event can be gathered and in a given situation may prove to be a crucial piece of evidence. At the same time, with fast development in the electronic techniques, the tapes/cassettes are more susceptible to tampering and alterations by transposition, excision, etc. which may be difficult to detect and, therefore, such evidence has to be received with caution. Though it would neither be feasible nor advisable to lay down any exhaustive set of rules by which the admissibility of such evidence may be judged but it needs to be emphasised that to rule out the possibility of any kind of tampering with the tape, the standard of proof about its authenticity and accuracy has to be more stringent as compared to other documentary evidence. In the instant case the appellant has miserably failed to prove the authenticity of the cassette as well as the accuracy of the speeches purportedly made by the respondent. Admittedly, the appellant did not lead any evidence to prove that the cassette produced on record was a true reproduction of the original speeches by the respondent or his agent.

After discussing broad features of case which impelled granting order favouring appellant, Supreme Court held that argument that appellant having given up his right under section 8(4) should not be permitted to offer himself as a candidate is wholly misconceived.  If a person convicted of any offence enumerated in section 8(1), (2) and (3) files an appeal within 3 months he continues to remain a Member of Parliament or Legislature of a Sate on basis of protection afforded by Sub-section (4), but not on any moral authority because electorate had exercised their franchise prior to order of conviction and not when he had become a convict.  But a person who resigns from Parliament or Assembly and seeks a re-election, if elected, will have greater moral authority to represent constituency.  Therefore, it is not possible to accept contentions raised.  Application by appellant deserves to be allowed.

Supreme Court did not accept contention.  It observed that Representation of People Act, 1951 is a complete Code.  Preamble of Act says it is 'to provide for conduct of elections to Houses of Parliament and to House or Houses of Legislature of each State, qualifications and disqualifications for membership of those Houses, corrupt practices, other offences at or in connection with such elections, decision of doubts and disputes arising out of or in connection with such elections.  Act provides not only eligibility and qualification for membership of House of People and Legislative Assembly but also for disqualification on conviction and other matters.  Parliament in its wisdom having made a specific provision for disqualification on conviction by enacting Section 8, it is not for Court to abridge or expand same.  Supreme Court in Rama Narang's case having recognized power possessed by Court of appeal to suspend or stay an order of conviction and having also laid down parameters for exercise of such power, it is not possible to hold, as a matter of rule, or, to lay down, that in order to prevent any person who has committed an offence from entering Parliament or Legislative Assembly order of conviction should not be suspended.  Courts have to interpret law as it stands and not on considerations which may be perceived to be morally more correct or ethical.  Contention that appellant would not be absolved of disqualification even if an order of suspension or stay of conviction is passed by Supreme Court was considered.  It was observed that Court was dealing with limited question viz. 'prayer made by appellant for suspending or staying order of conviction'.  Court was not required to adjudicate upon question as to what will be effect of order and further whether he will continue to be disqualified for purpose of contesting election even if prayer made by appellant is granted as such an issue is wholly alien to present controversy which can arise only in an election petition where validity of election may be called in question.

That will give an opportunity to the other side to test the genuineness and veracity of the sources of information. The other point of view is that the election petitioner will not be able to make any departure from the sources or grounds. If there is any embellishment of the case it will be discovered.

                "description": "Submission of return of election expenses - It cannot be said that responsibility of Election Commission is only to ensure form and not substance.\n\nUnder Section 10A when the Election Commission, on being satisfied that a person failed to lodge an account of election expenses within the time specified and in the manner required by or under this Act, can pass an order of disqualification of such person for a period of three years from the date of its order, it is needless to state that such an exercise should be carried out by the Election Commission with utmost care and caution and not by merely finding that there is a statement of account claimed to be a true copy of the election expenses maintained by the candidate and that it was lodged with the DEO in the appropriate format. In such an event, the concerned candidate can go scot- free even in a case where it can be brought to the notice of Election Commission that apart from the expenses disclosed in the statement of expenses lodged with the Election Commission, the candidate concerned had incurred various other expenses in a clandestine manner by adopting various manipulations and thereby, violating the requirement of law in particular Section 77(1) and (3) of the Act and thereby in effect not only cheat the electorate concerned, but even a constitutional authority in whom a very heavy responsibility has been invested under Article 324(1) of the Constitution. In fact, the requirement of an enquiry to be made by the Election Commission at the instance of the President of the country under Article 103 and in the case of Members of Parliament under Article 192 by the Governor of the State in the case of Member of Legislative Assembly of the State, fortifies above conclusion that even the President of the country and the Governor of a State can rely upon the report of the Election Commission based on an enquiry before taking a decision under Article 103(2) and under Article 192(2) of the Constitution. Therefore, to call the Election Commission's responsibility before passing an order under Section 10A only to see the form and not substance as canvassed by the Appellant is a proposition too difficult to accept.      [Para 46]\n\nThe maintenance of expenses, as mandated under Section 77(1), should not only be correct, but also be bona fide expenses. Therefore, even the explanation to sub-section (1) to Section 123 makes it clear that incurring of election expenses and the maintenance of account of those expenses are not an empty formality but the very purpose of stipulating such restrictions and directions under Section 77(1) and (3) read along with Section 78 explains the mandate to maintain absolute purity in elections by the contesting candidates. This is required in order to ensure that the process of the election is not sullied by resorting to unethical means while incurring election expenses.      [Para 47]\n\nCourt cannot turn a Nelson's eye and state that Section 77(1) and (3), as well as 78 would be relevant only for the purpose of ascertaining the corrupt practices under Section 123(6) of the Act and that such requirement of incurring bona fide and correct expenditure need not be a requirement for ascertainment for the Election Commission while exercising its powers under Section 10A of the Act. In fact, ascertainment of the requirement under Section 77(3) viz the expenses incurred, do not exceed the limit prescribed and can be made both for the purpose of an enquiry under Section 10A, as well as in the event of a candidate exceeding the limit as a corrupt practice for the purpose of invalidating the election. Therefore, the requirement under Section 77(3) has got twin objectives to be fulfilled.      [Para 48]"

[Burton's Legal Thesaurus, (Third edn.); p.349]. The phrase 'material facts', therefore, may be said to be those facts upon which a party relies for his claim or defence.  In other words, 'material facts' are facts upon which the plaintiff's cause of action or the defendant's defence depends.  What particulars could be said to be 'material facts' would depend upon the facts of each case and no rule of universal application can be laid down.  It is, however, absolutely essential that all basic and primary facts which must be proved at the trial by the party to establish the existence of a cause of action or defence are material facts and must be stated in the pleading by the party.

'Material facts' are primary or basic facts which must be pleaded by the plaintiff or by the defendant in support of the case set up by him either to prove his cause of action or defence.  'Particulars', on the other hand, are details in support of material facts pleaded by the party.  They amplify, refine and embellish material facts by giving distinctive touch to the basic contours of a picture already drawn so as to make it full, more clear and more informative.  'Particulars' thus ensure conduct of fair trial and would not take the opposite party by surprise. All 'material facts' must be pleaded by the party in support of the case set up by him.  Since the object and purpose is to enable the opposite party to know the case he has to meet with, in the absence of pleading, a party cannot be allowed to lead evidence.  Failure to state even a single material fact, hence, will entail dismissal of the suit or petition.  Particulars, on the other hand, are the details of the case which is in the nature of evidence a party would be leading at the time of trial.  [Para 25]\n\nThere is distinction between facta probanda (the facts required to be proved, i.e. material facts) and facta probantia (the facts by means of which they are proved, i.e. particulars or evidence).  It is settled law that pleadings must contain only facta probanda and not facta probantia. The material facts on which the party relies for his claim are called facta probanda and they must be stated in the pleadings.  But the facts or facts by means of which facta probanda (material facts) are proved and which are in the nature of facta probantia (particulars or evidence) need not be set out in the pleadings.  They are not facts in issue, but only relevant facts required to be proved at the trial in order to establish the fact in issue.  [Para 39]"

If the returned candidate does not recriminate as required by Section 97, then he cannot make any attack against the alternative claim made by the election petitioner. In such a case an enquiry would be held under Section 100 so far as the validity of the returned candidate's election is concerned, and if as a result of the said enquiry, declaration is made that the election of the returned candidate is void, then the Tribunal will proceed to deal with the alternative claim, but in doing so, the returned candidate will not be allowed to lead any evidence because he is precluded from raising any pleas against the validity of the claim of the alternative candidate.     [Para 18]\n\nIn the instant case, as explained hereinabove, there were 706 total votes, out of which 701 votes were polled. At the time of initial counting, both the candidates got equal votes as 336 and 29 votes were found invalid. On the request of the appellant, the Returning Officer permitted recounting of the votes and the appellant got 336 votes while the respondent no.1 got 335 votes and 30 votes were found to be invalid. In the election petition, the only grounds had been that 3 votes polled in favour of respondent no.1 which had wrongly been rejected and one vote which had been counted in favour of the appellant ought to have been declared invalid.\n\nIn view of the pleadings in the election petition, the case should have been restricted only to these four votes and even if the recrimination petition is taken into account, there could have been no occasion for the High Court to direct recounting of all the votes and in case certain discrepancies were found out in recounting of votes by the Registrar of the High Court as per the direction of the High Court, it was not permissible for the High Court to take into consideration all such discrepancies and decide the election petition or recrimination petition on the basis thereof. The course adopted by the High Court was impermissible and cannot be taken note of being in contravention with statutory requirements.        [Para 19,20]"

In the absence of the above, an election petition can be summarily dismissed. To see whether material facts have been duly disclosed or whether a cause of action arises, one must look at the averment and pleadings taken up by the party.  AIR 1969 SC 1201, (2007) SCC 617, (2004)7 SCC 181 - Rel.on.   [Para 35]\n\nThe averments of the appellants in the election petition did not disclose any definite cause of action. The appellant pleaded that the names of the 21 localities have been wrongfully included in the electoral roll of the relevant constituency. But there has been no order by the Election Commission for the alteration of the electoral rolls of the constituency. Furthermore the Election Commission does not have the power to amend the electoral roll as there has been no fresh delimitation carried out by the Delimitation Act. Delimitation is to be carried out by the Delimitation Commission and in furtherance of the delimitation carried out by the Commission, the Election Commission shall proceed to prepare electoral rolls for the constituency. Therefore, there has been no default on the part of any of the authorities, so as to render any votes void. There has been no violation of any of the provisions of the Act or the rules framed thereunder. The appellant primarily relies on the communication issued by the Election Commission but the same cannot be construed as any direction on the part of the Commission. The averments also do not disclose any material facts. As observed by the High Court, the main concern of the appellant in effect is the addition of the 21 colonies into the Meerut constituency and not in relation to addition or deletion of names in the electoral roll. But yet there has been no specific pleading in this regard in the election petition. The pleading should have been with respect to the said inclusion of the 21 colonies into the Meerut municipality constituency which was later incorporated into the 381 Meerut Municipality constituency. In the absence of such pleadings, it can safely be said that the election petition does not disclose any material facts and, therefore, High Court was right in summarily dismissing the election petition.

This reasoning of the learned Judge runs counter to the settled legal principles. In an election petition the burden of proof lies on the person who accuses that the elected person who had the support of the majority of the electorates still does not deserve to represent them in the State Assembly. In the present case, the appellant candidly accepts that her father is a Christian, but her mother who is separated from him never practiced Christian faith but continued to follow Hindu religion even after her marriage. The election petitioner has not produced any acceptable evidence to disprove the evidence adduced by the appellant and her witnesses. Therefore, issue of parentage which was sought to be projected as a factor which would prove that the appellant is a Christian and brought up as a Christian cannot be accepted.   [Para 47]"

Therefore the burden of proof shall lie on the petitioner filing the election petition. An election petition challenging the election of a returned candidate on the grounds of corrupt practices is not a criminal proceeding; but it is no less than a criminal proceeding with regard to the proof required to be furnished to the Court by the Petitioner. Though, in the present case, the charges are not those of corrupt practices, they are not any lesser in terms of seriousness; hence the burden of proof is on the election petitioner to prove the charges he has made beyond reasonable doubt.

The Legislature chose to use the expression 'PARTIES' for the reason that there are various categories of persons, who are capable of committing a corrupt practice in connection with the election of a returned candidate - (i) the returned candidate; or (ii) his election agent, or (iii) any other person with the consent of either the returned candidate or his election agent; or (iv) any other agent, as explained earlier.

It also requires that the petition be signed by the petitioner and verified in the manner laid down in the Code of Civil Procedure for the verification of the pleadings. While an election petition must necessarily contain a statement of material facts, deficiency if any, in providing the particulars of a corrupt practice could be made up by the petitioner at any later stage. The provision has been interpreted to mean that while a petition that does not disclose material facts can be dismissed as one that does not disclose a cause of action, dismissal on the ground of deficiency or non-disclosure of particulars of corrupt practice may be justified only if the election petitioner does not despite an opportunity given by the Court provide the particulars and thereby cure the defect.

The scheme of section 100 of the Representation of People Act, especially clause (d) of sub-section (i) thereof clearly prescribes that inspite of availability of grounds contemplated by sub-clause (i) to (iv) of clause (d) the election of a returned candidate shall not be voided unless and until it is proved that the result of the election in so far as it concerns to a returned candidate was materially affected.  In the instant case, there is no evidence to show material effect on the election of respondent assuming that the nomination paper of respondent no.2 was improperly accepted.  It is true that the votes secured by respondent no.2 are almost three times more than difference of votes secured by respondent and petitioner, but then in the absence of any material on record, would be just by way of speculation to assume that entire votes secured by respondent no.2 could have been secured by the petitioner, in case the nomination of respondent no.2 were to be rejected.  The possibility of respondent no.1 having some more votes of the votes secured by respondent no.2 cannot be ruled out.  Therefore, it can not be concluded that the election of respondent no.1 would be materially affected as a result of improper acceptance of the nomination paper of respondent no.2."

As observed above, the verification clause of the petition does not refer to the paragraphs of the petition, which relate to the corrupt practice under Section 123(4).  That defect in the verification clause is supplied by the affidavit which in terms refers to those paragraphs which are omitted from the verification clause of the petition and therefore, the learned Counsel appearing for the Respondent No.1 rightly submitted that it is for this reason that the petitioner himself states that this affidavit should be treated as a part and parcel of the election petition.

The first day for the period of limitation is required to be excluded for the convenience of the parties and if the declaration of the result is delayed or is done late in the night, the candidate or elector would hardly get any time for presentation of the election petition.

The principle is that when a period is delimited by statute or rule, which has both a beginning and an end and the word \"from\" is used indicating the beginning, the opening day is to be excluded and if the last day is to be excluded the word \"to\" is to be used. In order to exclude the first day of the period, the crucial thing to be noted is whether the period of limitation is delimited by a series of days or by any fixed period. This is intended to obviate the difficulties or inconvenience that may be caused to some parties. For instance, if a policy of insurance has to be good for one day from the 1st January, it might be valid only for a few hours after its execution and the party or the beneficiary in the insurance policy would not get reasonable time to lay claim, unless the 1st January is excluded from the period of computation.  [Para 12]\n\nIn order to apply Sec. 9, the first condition to be fulfilled is whether a prescribed period is fixed \"from\" a particular point. When the period is marked by terminus a quo and terminus ad quern, the canon of interpretation envisaged and Sec. 9 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 require to exclude the first day. The words \"from\" and \"within\" used in Sec. 81 (1) of the R. P. Act, 1951 do not express any contrary intention.  [Para 13]"

It is only after the election petitioner is able to demonstrate before the Court by leading satisfactory evidence that there was serious flaw in the counting procedure which had materially affected the result of election that the prayer for recount is generally allowed. In such a state of election law, the Court legitimately expects the parties to approach it with genuine grievances on truthful facts. Where false facts are pleaded and false evidence is produced to mislead the Court into interfering with the people's verdict of election, the misconduct of the parties to the election has to be viewed seriously. The Court allows an election petition only on strict proof of the grounds prescribed in Section 100 of the Act. If the parties to the election petitions are allowed to take the Court lightly even though attempts are skilfully made by them by false pleas and evidence to mislead the Court, the whole judicial process would be misused by clever parties to their advantage and to the detriment of the interest of the electorate who are vitally interested in the result of election.

                "description": "Election - Disqualification on conviction - Expression \"a person convicted of any offence and sentenced to imprisonment for not less than 2 years\" - Meaning and applicability of - \"A person convicted of any offence\" is construed as all offences of which a person is charged and held guilty at one trial - Further, applicability of expression \"sentenced to imprisonment for not less than 2 years\", would be decided by calculating total term of imprisonment for which person has been sentenced.\n\nR.C. Lahoti, CJI. (For self and on behalf of Shivraj V. Patil, B.N. Srikrishna and G.P. Mathur, JJ. :-\n\nThe word 'any' may have one of the several meanings, according to the context and the circumstances. It may mean 'all'; 'each'; 'every'; 'some'; or 'one or many out of several'. The word 'any' may be used to indicate the quantity such as 'some', 'out of many', 'an infinite number'. It may also be used to indicate quality or nature of the noun which it qualifies as an adjective such as 'all' or 'every'. In Section 8(3) of the RPA, the word 'any' has been used as an adjective qualifying the word 'offence' to suggest not the number of offence but the nature of the offence. A bare reading of sub-section (3) shows that the nature of the offence included in sub-section (3) is 'any offence other than any offence referred to in sub-section (1) or sub-section (2) (of Section 8)'. The use of adjective 'any' qualifying the noun 'offence' cannot be pressed in service to countenance the submission that the sentence of imprisonment for not less than two years must be in respect of a single offence.         [Para 51,52]\n\nIt is clear from a bare reading of sub-section (3) of Section 8 of the RPA that the actual period of imprisonment is relevant. The provisions of Section 8 of the RPA have to be construed in harmony with the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and in such manner as to give effect to the provisions contained in both the legislations. In the case of consecutive sentences the aggregate period of imprisonment awarded as punishment for the several offences and in the case of punishments consisting of several terms of the imprisonment made to run concurrently, the longest of the several terms of imprisonment would be relevant to be taken into consideration for the purpose of deciding whether the sentence of imprisonment is for less than 2 years or not.          [Para 45,47]\n\nThe purpose of enacting disqualification under Section 8(3) of the RPA is to prevent criminalization of politics. Those who break the law should not make the law. Generally speaking, the purpose sought to be achieved by enacting disqualification on conviction for certain offences is to prevent persons with criminal background from entering into politics, and the House - a powerful wing of governance. Persons with criminal background do pollute the process of election as they do not have many a holds barred and have no reservation from indulging into criminality to win success at an election. Thus, Section 8 seeks to promote freedom and fairness at elections, as also law and order being maintained while the elections are being held. The provision has to be so meaningfully construed as to effectively prevent the mischief sought to be prevented. The expression \"a person convicted of any offence\" has to be construed as all offences of which a person has been charged and held guilty at one trial. The applicability of the expression \"sentenced to imprisonment for not less than 2 years\" would be decided by calculating the total term of imprisonment for which the person has been sentenced.                             [Para 54]\n\nK. G. Balkrishan, J. (Contra) :-\n\nI am unable to subscribe to the contention that the word \"any\" used in Section 8(3) of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 should be construed so as to mean \"more than one\" or \"all\" or in a sense of plurality. It is also difficult to construe the words \"not less than two years\" used in Section 8(3) of the RPA by giving emphasis to the total period of imprisonment that a convict may undergo if all the periods of imprisonment for various offences are put together, when it is ordered to run consecutively.      [Para 67]\n\nIt is the gravity of the offence that matters and not the conviction for various minor offences and the total period of two years or more to be calculated by putting together all sentences for various minor offences. \"Any offence\" used in Section 8(3) of the RPA is to be taken as \"out of many offences\".     [Para 72]\n\nFurther, the direction for the sentence to run concurrently or consecutively is a direction as to the mode in which the sentence is to be executed. That does not affect the nature of the sentence. It is also important to note that in the Code of Criminal Procedure, there are no guidelines or specific provisions to suggest under what circumstances the various sentences of imprisonment shall be directed to run concurrently or consecutively. There are no judicial decisions, to my knowledge, by superior courts laying down the guidelines as to what should be the criteria for directing the convict to undergo imprisonment on various counts concurrently or consecutively. In certain cases, if the person convicted is a habitual offender and he had been found guilty of offences on various counts and it is suspected that he would be a menace if he is let loose on the society, then the Court would direct that such person shall undergo the imprisonment consecutively. Merely because the Magistrate ordered that the sentence shall run consecutively, and the aggregate period exceeds two years or more, a person convicted would not incur the disqualification under Section 8(3) of the RPA. If that be so, a Magistrate may order the sentence on various counts to run concurrently in one case and for the same type of offences, if another Magistrate directs the sentence on various counts to run consecutively, the person in the latter case would incur the disqualification whereas the former will not have any such disqualification under Section 8(3) of the RPA. The disqualification under Section 8(3) of the RPA shall not be solely dependent on the direction as to the mode in which the sentence is to be executed, especially when there are no statutory or judicial guidelines in this regard.

The non-disclosure of the grounds will indicate that the election petitioner did not come forward with the sources of information at the first opportunity. It is also held that the real importance of setting out the source of information at the time of the presentation of the petition is to give the other side notice of the contemporaneous evidence on which the election petition is based. This is required so that an opportunity is given to the other side to test the genuineness and veracity of the sources of information. The other point of view is that the election petitioner will not be able to make any departure from the sources or grounds, if there is any embellishment of the case it will be discovered. The whole of the petition in the present case proceeds on the basis that the Board appealing to the voters has been displayed with the consent of the petitioner. Yet, there is not a whisper throughout the petition or in the affidavit as to how this consent was obtained, when it was obtained, where was it obtained. A bald statement is made to the effect that the boards have been displayed with the consent of the first Respondent/his agents/his workers. Thus the first Respondent would not know at all as to whose consent is being pleaded. Since the pleadings play an important role in an election petition, the legislature has provided that the allegations of corrupt practice must be properly alleged and both the material facts and particulars provided in the petition itself so as to disclose a complete cause of action.

In such a case an enquiry cannot be held into and the election petition decided on the finding (a) that any votes have been improperly cast in favour of a candidate other than the returned candidate, or (b) any votes were improperly refused or rejected in regard to the returned candidate. (2) A recrimination by the returned candidate or any other party can be filed under Section 97 (1) in a case where in an election petition an additional declaration is claimed that any candidate other than the returned candidate has been duly elected. (3)  For the purpose of enabling an enquiry that any votes have been improperly cast in favour of any candidate other than the returned candidate or any votes have been improperly refused or rejected in reward in the returned candidate the election Court shall acquire jurisdiction to do so only on the two conditions being satisfied : (i) the election petition seeks a declaration that any candidate other than returned candidate has been duly elected over and above the declaration that the election of the returned candidate is void; and (ii) the recrimination petition under Section 97 (1) is filed. (4)  A recrimination petition must satisfy the same requirements as that of an election petition in the matter of pleadings, signing and verification as an election petition is required to fulfil within the meaning of Section 83 of the Act and must be accompanied by the security or the further security referred to in Sections 117 and 118 of the Act. (5)  The bar on enquiry enacted by Section 97 read with Section 100 (1) (d)(iii) of the Act is attracted when the validity of the votes is to be gone into and adjudged or in other words the question of improper reception, refusal or rejection of any vote or reception of any vote which is void is to be gone into. The bar is not attracted to a case where it is merely a question of correct counting of the votes without entering into adjudication as to propriety, impropriety or validity of acceptance, rejection or reception of any vote. In other words, where on a recount the election Judge finds the result of recount to be different from the one arrived at by the returning officer or when the election Judge finds that there was an error of counting the bar is not attracted because the Court in a pure and simple counting carried out by it or under its directions is not adjudicating upon any issue as to improper reception, refusal or rejection of any vote or the reception of any vote which is void but is performing mechanical process of counting or recounting by placing the vote at the place where it ought to have been placed. A case of error in counting would fall within the purview of sub-clause (iv), and not sub-clause (iii) of Clause (d) of sub-section (1) of Section 100 of the Act. [Para 33]"

Nevertheless, the power to direct inspection of ballot papers is there and ought to be exercised if, based on precise allegations of material facts, also substantiated, a case for permitting inspection is made out as is necessary to determine the issue arising for decision in the case and in the interest of justice. In a proper case where the interests of justice demand it, the Tribunal may call upon the returning officer to produce the ballot papers and may permit inspection by the parties before it of the ballot papers which power is clearly implicit in Ss. 100(l)(d)(iii), 101,102 and Rule 93 of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961. This power to order inspection of the ballot papers which is apart from Order XI Code of Civil Procedure may be exercised, subject to the statutory restrictions about the secrecy of the ballot paper prescribed by Ss. 94 and 128(1).

In order to protect the secrecy of ballots the Court would permit a recount only upon a clear case in that regard having been made out. To permit or not to permit a recount is a question involving jurisdiction of the Court. Once a recount has been allowed the Court cannot shut its eyes on the result of recount on the ground that the result of recount as found is at variance with the pleadings. Once the Court has permitted recount within the well-settled parameters of exercising jurisdiction in this regard, it is the result of the recount which has to be given effect to. [Para 28]\n\nOnce the Court exercises its jurisdiction to enter into the question of improper reception, refusal or rejection of any vote, or the reception of any vote which is void by reference to the election result of the returned candidate under Section 100 (1)(d)(iii), as also as to the result of the election of any other candidate by reference to Section 97 of the Act and enters into scrutiny of the votes polled, followed by recount, consistently with its findings on the validity or invalidity of the votes, it cannot refuse to give effect to the result of its findings as to the validity or invalidity of the votes for the purpose of finding out true result of recount though the actual finding as to validity or otherwise of the votes by reference to number may be at variance with the pleadings. In short, the pleadings and proof in the matter of recount have relevance for the purpose of determining the question of jurisdiction to permit or not to permit recount. Once the jurisdiction to order recount is found to have been rightly exercised, thereafter it is the truth as revealed by the result of recounting that has to be given effect to.  [Para 29]"

Such defects in supply of true copies are not always incurable. The main consideration which would weigh is that the returned candidate must get a correct idea of the allegations of corrupt practices so that it may be possible to understand and meet the charges levelled against him. The true copy supplied should also reflect that the part of the petition containing the allegations of corrupt practices has been verified and sworn by the petitioner on oath. The fact that the name, stamp, seal and signature of the Notary are not indicated or missing in the true copy is not material nor the absence of stamp of attestation by the Notary.  [Para 13]\n\nThe purpose of the provision to furnish a true copy of the petition is not to frustrate the cause of the petitioner approaching the Court by adhering strictly to technicalities of little consequence. On the other hand the anxiety is that the respondent must have correct idea of the allegations of corrupt practices made against him with some responsibility and that he may not be misled in any material respect by furnishing of a copy of the affidavit which may not be a correct copy having vital variation from the original. It is true that in the matters relating to elections and election petitions strict compliance of the legal provisions is necessary and full care is to be taken to see that rights of an elected representative are not lightly disturbed and rightly so. But an election petition is not to be thrown at the threshold on the slightest pretext of one kind or the other which may or may not have any material bearing on the factors to be strictly adhered to in such matters. It is substance not form which would matter. If it is permitted otherwise, the returned candidate would only be in the look out microscopically for any kind of technical lacuna or defect to abort the endeavour of the petitioner to bring to trial the issues relating to corrupt practices in the elections. The purpose of the law on the point cannot be to allow the returned candidate to avoid the trial of the issues of corrupt practices raised against him on the basis of any little defect which may not result in any vital variation between the original and the true copy so as to have the effect of misleading the returned candidate.  [Para 17]\n\nThe only grievance is that the stamp and the name of the Oath Commissioner is not indicated in the true copy of the affidavit. If it was there it would have been better but absence of stamp and the name of Oath Commissioner will not be a vital or material deviation from the original nor it may in any manner mislead the returned candidate. Prima facie on perusal of the heading of the affidavit and detailed verification of the contents of the paragraphs, would normally lead one to believe that the averments have been made on affidavit. In paragraph one of the affidavit there is a specific mention that the petitioner was acquainted with the facts of the case for the purpose of swearing of the affidavit in support of contention of corrupt practices taken recourse to by respondent No. 1 and respondent No. 7. In the end the petitioner signs as 'deponent' and he is identified by Advocate's Clerk. That being the position, mere omission of indicating the name of the Oath Commissioner or an endorsement in the true copy that the affidavit was attested by an Oath Commissioner bearing his stamp and seal etc. would not be material. Once an averment is there that affidavit was being sworn in support of allegations of corrupt practices and that the petitioner had put his signature thereon, prima facie fulfilment of such a legal requirement is adequately reflected even in absence of name and seal etc. of Oath Commissioner in the true copy.

However, in the present case, R-1 submitted affidavit in the prescribed form along with the nomination paper. The only thing is that he did not give complete information about the immovable assets of himself and his spouse and suppressed information about one flat and liability to pay Municipal taxes. However, on that count the Returning Officer could not have rejected nomination paper. No fault can be found with the order of the Returning Officer accepting the nomination of the candidate.  [Para 50,51]\n\nChapter VIII of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 relates to election expenses. Sub-section 1 of Section 77 thereof mandates that every candidate at an election shall, either by himself or by his election Agent, keep a separate and correct account of all expenditure in connection with the election incurred or authorised by him or by his election Agent between the date on which he has been nominated and the date of declaration of the result thereof, both dates inclusive. Sub-section 2 of section 77 directs that the account shall contain such particulars, as may be prescribed. Sub-section 3 of section 77 mandates that the total of the said expenditure shall not exceed such amount as may be prescribed.  Part VIII of the Conduct of Election Rules, 1961 relates to election expenses. Rule 90 thereof provides that the total of the expenditure of which account is to be kept under Section 77 and which is incurred or authorized in connection with an election in a State shall not exceed Rs.10 Lacs in any one assembly constituency.\n\nSection 78 of the Representation of the People Act, 1951 directs that every contesting candidate at an election shall, within thirty days from the date of election of the returned candidate lodge with the District Election Officer an account of his election expenses which shall be a true copy of the account kept by him or by his election Agent under section 77.  Sub-section 6 of Section 123 provides that the incurring or authorizing of expenditure in contravention of section 77 shall be deemed to be corrupt practice for the purposes of this Act.  Section 100(1)(b) provides that if the High Court is of the opinion that any corrupt practice has been committed by a returned candidate or his election Agent or by any other person with the consent of a returned candidate or his election Agent, the High Court shall declare the election of the returned candidate to be void. Mere vague and general statement that the candidate and his workers with his consent spent money in election in excess of permissible limit would not be sufficient to constitute corrupt practice.\n\nIn the instant case, the petitioner has failed to prove that there was wrongful acceptance of the nomination paper of the candidate and that he indulged in corrupt practice by incurring expenditure more than the prescribed limit and by hosting free meals to the voters to solicit their votes in his favour. The petition, therefore, fails on all counts. [Para 61,65,90]"

Therefore this is only a power to appoint the Presiding Officer for polling stations and the polling officers. However, for making such appointment, from what source the District Election Officers should draw the officers has not been provided in the said section. Since no provision is made in the said section as to from which source, the District Election Officer can appoint the said officers, such power cannot be read into said section. If such power is read in section 26, assuming for the moment it is so, section 159 of the Act of 1951 becomes redundant. It is a basic principle of interpretation of the statutes that a provision in the statute should not be interpreted in such a manner which will render the other provision or provisions from the said statute as redundant. Therefore, held, that the submission of the counsel for the Election Commission that Section 26 of the Act of 1951 gives such power to requisition the staff, is without any merit.  [Para 15]"

The salutary purpose of introducing the said section 8(3) is to ensure that the persons who are elected to the assembly and the parliament are completely above-board and are the persons having high moral character and integrity irrespective of their political leanings. The legislature introduced the said provision after it observed the general decadence and falling standards of persons who contest the elections for the assembly and the parliament and, therefore, the legislature felt that this trend was not in the best interest of the sovereignty, unity and integrity of this country. If persons having tainted moral character and who are declared by the competent court to be the law breakers, the legislature felt that such people were disqualified for the purpose of being elected as the law makers. It would be an ironical situation if such persons whose nominations are rejected on account of their conviction and sentence by the trial court are allowed to challenge the election of a returned candidate and on some technical ground the election of such a returned candidate is allowed to be set aside. This, surely, cannot be the intention of the provisions of section 100 (1)(C) of the said Act. The Returning Officer has correctly rejected the nomination papers of the petitioner as he had incurred disqualification under section 8(3) of the said Act merely because the order of conviction and sentence is stayed that would not obliterate the order of conviction and sentence which is imposed by the trial court.

He filed his written statement and issues were framed. The case was then adjourned to 17th March for the petitioners' evidence only and he examined all his witnesses on 17th to 20th March. On 20th defendant had entered appearance through counsel and claimed the right to plead. The Election Tribunal did not exercise its discretion because it considered that it had none and thought that until the 'ex parte' order was set aside the defendant could not appear either personally or through counsel. No good cause was shown and so the defendant had no right to be relegated to the position that he would have occupied if he had appeared on 17-3-1953, but he had a right to appear through counsel on 20-3-1953 and take part in the proceedings from the stage at which they had then reached, subject to such terms and conditions as the Tribunal might think fit to impose. Whether he should have been allowed to cross-examine the three witnesses who were examined after the appearance of his counsel, or whether he should have been allowed to adduce evidence, was a matter that had to depend on whatever views the Tribunal in a sound exercise of judicial discretion would choose to take of the circumstances of this particular case, but there was no justification for not at least allowing counsel to argue. AIR 1949 Oudh 59 (FB) - Overruled.\t [Para 36,38,40]\n\nWhen the defendant has been served and has been afforded an opportunity of appearing then if he does not appear the Court may proceed in his absence. But the Court is not directed to make an 'ex parte' order. Of course the fact that it is, proceeding 'ex parte' will be recorded in the minutes of its proceedings but that is merely a statement of the fact and is not an order made against the defendant in the sense of an 'ex parte' decree or other 'ex parte' order which the Court is authorised to make. All that R.6(1)(a) does is to remove a bar and no more. It merely authorises the Court to do that which it could not have done without this authority namely to proceed in the absence of one of the parties. The contrast in language between R.7 and R.13 emphasises this. Rule 7 provides that if at an adjourned hearing the defendant appears and shows good cause for his \"previous non-appearance\" he can be heard in answer to the suit \"as if he had appeared on the day fixed for his appearance\". This cannot be read to mean that he cannot be allowed to appear at all if he does not show good cause. All it means is that he cannot be relegated to the position he would have occupied if he had appeared. If a party does appear on \"the day to which the hearing of the suit is adjourned\", he cannot be stopped from participating in the proceedings simply because he did not appear on the first or some other hearing. If the defendant does not appear at the first hearing, the Court can proceed ex parte, which means that it can proceed without a written statement; and O.9, R.7 makes it clear that unless good cause is shown the defendant cannot be relegated to the position that he would have occupied if he had appeared. That means that he cannot put in a written statement unless he is allowed to do so and if the case is one in which the Court considers a written statement should have been put in, the consequences entitled by O.8, R.l0 must be suffered. What those consequences should be in a given case is for the Court, in the exercise of its judicial discretion, to determine to meet the ends of justice. When we speak of the ends of justice, we mean justice not only to the defendant and to the other side but also to witnesses and others who may be inconvenienced.\t [Para 26,28,30,33,34]\n\nIf the defendant does not appear at the adjourned hearing (irrespective of whether or not he appeared at the first hearing) O.17, R.2 applies and the Court is given the widest possible discretion either to dispose of the suit in one of the modes directed in that behalf by O.9 or make such other order as it thinks fit. The Court has a discretion which it must exercise. Its hands are not tied by the socalled 'ex parte' order; and if it thinks they are tied by O.9, R.7 then it is not exercising the discretion which the law says it should and, in a given case interference may be called for.\t [Para 37]"

As such the candidate is duty bound to deliver a nomination paper completed in the prescribed form. Section 36(2)(b), lays down that the Returning Officer shall reject any nomination if there has been failure to comply with any of the provisions of Section 33 or Section 34 of the. If the nomination paper was not complete as is required U/s 33(1) of the R.P.Act, the Returning Officer had no option but to reject the same. The nomination form was incomplete as can be seen as no information on a separate sheet or list was filled in though it was specifically represented in the nomination paper i.e. form 3-C. No question would arise of completing the nomination paper on the next date or the date of scrutiny of the nomination paper. As such the question of giving opportunity to the petitioner also would be redundant. Section 36 is mandatory and enjoins the Returning Officer to refuse any nomination when there has been any failure to comply with any of the provisions of Section 33, the Returning Officer at that stage can not remedy essential defect or permit to be remedied that defect. He must leave it as it is. If it is technical and non-substantial, it will not matter, if it is not, it can not be set right.\n\nThe defect in the present case is certainly of a substantial character.

The general rule is that though an employer may assign the benefits and obligations of a contract to an assignee, he will not be relieved of his obligations towards the contractor, unless the contractor is also a party to the assignment, in which event there is an assignment coupled with novation, (a new contract between the assignee and the contractor). But the exception to this general rule is where a statute vests certain assets of the State in a statutory corporation (or Government Company or other specified person) and provides that as a consequence, the rights and obligations of the State relating to such assets shall stand transferred to such statutory corporation (or Government Company or specified person). In that event, the statute engrafts itself into the existing contract and as a consequence, the statutory corporation stands substituted in place of the original employer, and the existing contracts become contracts between the statutory corporation and the contractor. In case of such statutory vesting/transfer, the consent of the contractor for the substitution of the contracting party and the assignment/transfer of the contract is not necessary. The contract, on such statutory transfer and vesting, though originally entered with the State Government ceased to be a subsisting contract with the State Government from the date of such transfer and vesting and will be considered as a subsisting contract with the statutory corporation (GMIDC). Therefore, the contract though subsisting on the date of filing of nominations and scrutiny of nomination, was not a contract with the appropriate Government, but with GMIDC.   [Para 24,26]"

Without this, democracy will fail to thrive. Therefore, even if the right to vote is statutory, the significance attached with the right is massive. Free and fair election is a basic structure of the Constitution and necessarily includes within its ambit the right of an elector to cast his vote without fear of reprisal, duress or coercion. Protection of elector's identity and affording secrecy is therefore integral to free and fair elections and an arbitrary distinction between the voter who casts his vote and the voter who does not cast his vote is violative of Article 14. Thus, secrecy is required to be maintained for both categories of persons. Giving right to a voter not to vote for any candidate while protecting his right of secrecy is extremely important in a democracy. Such an option gives the voter the right to express his disapproval with the kind of candidates that are being put up by the political parties.\n\nIn the light of the above Rules 41(2) & (3) and 49-O of the Rules are ultra vires Section 128 of the RP Act and Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution to the extent they violate secrecy of voting. Hence the Election Commission ought to provide necessary provision in the ballot papers/EVMs and another button called \"None of the Above\" (NOTA) may be provided in EVMs so that the voters, who come to the polling booth and decide not to vote for any of the candidates in the fray, are able to exercise their right not to vote while maintaining their right of secrecy. \n\nThe direction can also be supported by the fact that in the existing system a dissatisfied voter ordinarily does not turn up for voting which in turn provides a chance to unscrupulous elements to impersonate the dissatisfied voter and cast a vote, be it a negative one. Furthermore, a provision of negative voting would be in the interest of promoting democracy as it would send clear signals to political parties and their candidates as to what the electorate think about them.

The jurisdiction to exercise the discretion is statutorily provided.  The exercise of such discretion is also controlled by the prescription regarding forming of opinion as regards sufficiency of material or otherwise.  [Para 5,6]\n\nThere are two options given to the officer to form opinion i.e. whether there is sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of suspicion against the accused persons.  It nowhere deals with the right of the accused to get bail.  The third category is contemplated by clause (b) of the proviso.  It inter alia, provides that when it appears to the officer that there is no sufficient evidence or reasonable suspicion, he shall release the accused person on his executing a bond with or without surety as the officer of the Force may direct to appear if and when so required before the Magistrate having jurisdiction and shall make a full report of all the particulars of the case to his superior officer.  This category deals with a case where there is absence of sufficient evidence or reasonable ground of suspicion.  In such case concerned officer has the power to release accused person on his executing bonds.  Therefore, the High Court was not justified in holding that all the offences under the Act are bailable.  Such view is contrary to the provisions contained in Section 8 of the Act. [Para 8]"

The Rules in this case provide that the mode of selection is by interview and assessment of performance reports for the preceding three years as officer Scale I. The seniority list of officers in Scale I was published on 4.12.1996. Thereafter, the promotion process was held by earmarking 60 marks for assessment of performance Reports (at the rate of 20 marks per year) and 40 marks were allotted for interview. The officers possessing the minimum qualifying marks of 78%, were then promoted on the basis of seniority. What should be the minimum necessary merit for promotion, is a matter that is decided by the management, having in mind the requirements of the post to which promotions are to be made. The employer has the discretion to fix different minimum merit, for different categories of posts, subject to the relevant Rules. For example, for promotions at lower levels, it may fix a lesser minimum qualifying marks and fix a comparatively higher minimum qualifying marks for higher posts. In the first respondent Bank, the post of officer-Grade II (Area Managers and Senior Managers) is a very senior position, next only to the top post of General Manager. As the officers promoted to Scale II were required to head larger branches or departments in the Head Office, shouldering higher responsibilities and virtually competing with commercial banks, it cannot be said that the fixing the minimum qualifying marks at 78% is excessive, unreasonable or arbitrary. Another aspect requires to be noticed. Where the assessment of minimum merit is with reference to previous performance record (Annual Confidential Records) and/or by interview, as contrasted from a written examination, prescription of 78% as minimum, will not be considered as unreasonably high.   [Para 11,12]\n\nWhether the guidelines/rules adopted for assessing the minimum necessary merit by prescribing marks under several heads or by prescribing a specific minimum mark, is reasonable or arbitrary, would depend upon the facts of each case. If it is demonstrated that the minimum marks were fixed with the intention of favouring someone or to specifically exclude someone, the courts may interfere. Similarly, where the minimum marks are shown to have been fixed to defeat or nullify the mode of seniority-cum-merit for promotion, there may be a cause for interference. In other cases, there is very little scope to interfere with the procedure adopted to ascertain the minimum required merit.   [Para 13,15]"

The RRB Rules, 1998 clearly provided that officers holding post in 8 years as an officer on regular basis in the RRB shall be considered for promotion to the next higher post. The aforesaid rule does not provide that any employee/officer, who has suffered a punishment or has received an adverse appraisal/Grade 'D' in the performance appraisal, shall not be eligible. However, the Circulars dated 30th November, 2009 and 12th July, 2010 enables the appellant banks to eliminate such employees, which is clearly contrary to the provisions contained in the statutory service rules. The procedure prescribed under the aforesaid two Circulars clearly has the effect of supplanting the provision of eligibility, which is not permissible.\n\nWhilst assessing the eligibility of the candidates, determination of bare minimum merit is not envisaged. There is, in fact, a complete segregation of Rule 2(e) from Rule 2(f). Determining the eligibility of candidate is in the nature of a ministerial function. The management merely has to see that the candidate possesses the minimum length of service and that he/she is confirmed in the feeder cadre. The determination of bare minimum merit is on the basis of the performance in the written test/interview and performance appraisal. This is the function of the Selection Committee i.e. Departmental Promotion Committee.\n\nThere is no doubt that punishment and adverse service record are relevant to determine the minimum merit by the DPC. But to debar a candidate, to be considered for promotion, on the basis of punishment or unsatisfactory record would require the necessary provision in the statutory service Rules. There is no such provision under the 1998 Rules.\n\nDifferent rules/regulations of the banks provide specific punishments such as \"withholding of promotion, reduction in rank, lowering in ranks/pay scales\". However, there is another range of penalty such as censure, reprimand, withholding of increments etc. which are also prescribed under various staff regulations. To debar such an employee from being considered for promotion would tantamount to also inflicting on such employee, the punishment of withholding of promotion. In such circumstances, a punishment of censure/ reprimand would, in fact, read as censure/reprimand + 5 years debarment from promotion. Thus the circulars issued by the bank debarring such employees from being considered would be clearly contrary to the statutory rules.\t            [Para 31,35,36,40]"

This does not reflect a failure of the child but the inability of the teacher to address the needs of the child. The child is being conditioned by a social system which provides a disadvantaged environment. The Act casts an obligation on teachers in Section 24(d) to assess the learning ability of each child and to accordingly supplement additional instructions as are required. The Act casts obligations on the State and upon local authorities, schools and teachers to contribute in providing meaningful access to primary education on a universal basis to all children between the ages of six and fourteen until they complete elementary education. To hold back a child or expel a child from elementary school is wrong because it transfers the duty of an enabling school environment from the teacher to the taught. \t\t\t       [Para 3]\n\nIt is a matter of common knowledge that in many cases children are held back as a result of the inability of the parents to shoulder the financial burden of education for the children in the family. Parliament was evidently conscious of these social realities and the provision has, therefore, been carefully enacted to ensure that children are not victims of an unequal social system. If a child needs special attention, a duty is cast upon the teacher and the institution to take all measures. The underlying principle is that a child should not be penalized for a situation on which he or she possibly can have no control. The submission that this would lead to a deterioration of academic standards, is untenable. First and foremost, the term \"academic standards\" is itself capable of more than one meaning and content. To assess education merely in terms of the proficiency in an examination is to adopt an extremely narrow view of the object of education. Education particularly at the elementary level must emphasise the need to encourage a child into a holistic pattern of development which is ethical and value based.\n\nThe policy which is embodied in Section 16 was one which fell within the domain of Parliament as an enacting body. It would be impermissible for the Court in the exercise of its writ jurisdiction to reassess the wisdom of the policy adopted by the Parliament which in any event is both fair and proper. however, the State must ensure a process of continuous evaluation of teachers and put in place a scheme for upgrading skills for teachers. \t\t\t\t\t [Para 4,5]"

The definition will embrace not only what is comprised within the ordinary meaning of the 'means' part, but will also include all that is stated after the 'includes' part. The term 'includes' is generally used in the definition clause in order to enlarge the meaning of words or phrases which may find place in the statute and when it is so used, the defined word or words must be construed as comprehending, not only such things, as they signify according to their natural import, but also those things which the interpretation clause declares that they shall include.   [Para 11]\n\nThe term 'recognised' does not mean and imply only the school recognised in terms of Sections 18 and 19 of the RTE and no other because the legislature in the first place has not specified or defined the term 'recognised' to mean recognised under Sections 18 and 19 of the RTE. Secondly, the legislature, prior to the word 'recognised' has used the word 'any', which in the context, is a word indicating amplitude.

Rule 11 of the Rules provides for recognition of the schools and sub-rule (6) of Rule 11 provides that if the school fails to conform to the norms and standards prescribed in the Schedule and conditions mentioned in sub-rule (1) after three years from the commencement of the Act, shall cease to function. Sub-rule (1) of Rule 11 do not provide for taking any action on account of absentism of students.The withdrawal of recognition shall have to be resorted to in observance of the procedure prescribed under Rule 12.

Rule 12 provides that where the District Education Officer, on his own motion, or on any representation received from any person, has reason to believe, that a school recognised under rule 11, has violated one or more of the conditions for grant of recognition or has failed to fulfill the norms and standards prescribed in the Schedule, the District Education Officer shall act in the manner prescribed under the said rule, issue order of withdrawal of recognition. The grounds referred to in the Government Resolution in respect of absentism of the students beyond 50% or 20% do not call for action of withdrawal of recognition within the ambit of Section 18 of the Act of 2009 or the Rules framed by the State Government in that behalf.

This shows that the legislature never intended to treat a school which has received a land, building, equipment or other facilities either free of cost or at a concessional rate, as aided schools. Sub-section (2) applies only to unaided schools as provided in Sub-clause (iv) of Clause (n) of Section 2 of the Education Act and therefore, the second proviso also applies only to such unaided schools. It follows that merely because a school has received any land or building or equipment or other facilities either free of cost or at a concessional rate, the said school does not cease to be an unaided school. If intention of the legislature was to treat such a school receiving land, building, equipment or other facilities as aforesaid as an aided school, there was no reason to incorporate the second proviso which applies only to unaided schools specified in Sub-clause (iv) of Clause (n) of Section 2 of the Education Act.  [Para 37]\n\nThus, on plain reading of the provisions of the Education Act, a school becomes aided school provided it receives aid or grants in terms of money to meet whole or part of its expenses. Obviously, for running a school , there is a recurring expenditure on the payment of salaries and allowances to the teaching and non-teaching staff, maintenance of the school building, and purchase of articles such as stationary etc required for day-today functioning of the school. If any amount is received by a school either from an Appropriate Government or a local authority to meet whole or a part of such expenditure, a school can be treated as an aided school.  [Para 38]"

                "description": "Secondary School Code (2002), Paras 92, 101, 105, 106 - Aid or grants - Meaning - \"Aid or grants\" means payment of amounts for meeting expenditure of schools, most of which are of recurring nature. \n\nThe provisions of Secondary  School Code and Bombay Primary Education Rules make it clear that the grant-in-aid is made payable to the schools for meeting the expenses for running the school the most of which is of a recurring nature. Thus, the concept of grants or aid appears to be payment of amounts for meeting the expenditure of the schools on various heads.  [Para 40]\n\nIt is true that the meaning to the word \"aid\" or \"grants\" will have to be assigned in the context of the provisions of the Education Act proviso to Sub-section (2) of Section 12 of the Education Act, a grant of land, building, equipment or other facilities free of cost or at a concessional rate is neither a grant nor an aid within the meaning of Sub-clauses (ii) and (iv) of Clause (n) of Section 2 of the Education Act.  [Para 42]\n\n The words \"aid or grants\" in Sub-clause (ii) of Clause (n) of Section 2 of the Education Act are qualified by the words \"to meet the whole or part of its expenses\". The words \"aid or grants\" cannot be interpreted independently of the qualification \"to meet whole or part of its expenses\" provided under Sub-clause (ii) of Clause (n) of Section 2 of the Education Act. Moreover, the second proviso is also a pointer for the interpretation. If wide meaning is assigned to the words \"aid or grants\", the second proviso to Sub-section (2) of Section 12 of the Education Act becomes redundant.\n\nTo conclude, a school becomes an aided school under the Education Act provided it receives aid or grants from the Appropriate Government or a local authority in terms of money to meet its whole or part of expenditure. Thus, a school becomes an aided school provided it receives aid or grants in terms of money to meet its recurring expenditure. The grant of land, building, equipment or any other facilities free of costs or at a concessional rate by itself will not be an aid or grant within the meaning of Sub-clause (iv) of Clause (n) of Section 2 of the Education Act.

There may, of course, be some cases of overlapping, that is children who may answer both the definitions, but for availing benefits under the RTE Act, it is not necessary that a child must satisfy both the definitions.\t\t\t\t\t        [Para 33,35]"

H. Kapadia, C.J.I. & Swatanter Kumar, J. :-\n\nK. S. Radhakrishnan, J. (Dissenting) :-\n\nFrom the scheme of Article 21A and the 2009 Act, it is clear that the primary obligation is of the State to provide for free and compulsory education to children between the age of 6 to 14 years and, particularly, to children who are likely to be prevented from pursuing and completing the elementary education due to inability to afford fees or charges. Correspondingly, every citizen has a right to establish and administer educational institution under Article 19(1)(g) so long as the activity remains charitable. Such an activity undertaken by the private institutions supplements the primary obligation of the State. Thus, the State can regulate by law the activities of the private institutions by imposing reasonable restrictions under Article 19(6). Since the Article 19(1)(g) right is not an absolute right as Article 30(1), the 2009 Act cannot be termed as unreasonable. To put an obligation on the unaided non-minority school to admit 25% children in class I under Section 12(1)(c) cannot be termed as an unreasonable restriction. Such a law cannot be said to transgress any constitutional limitation. The object of the 2009 Act is to remove the barriers faced by a child who seeks admission to class I and not to restrict the freedom under Article 19(1)(g).\n\nSuch a condition in Section 12(1)(c) imposed while granting recognition to the private unaided non-minority school cannot be termed as unreasonable. Such a condition would come within the principle of reasonableness in Article 19(6). Indeed, by virtue of Section 12(2) read with Section 2(n)(iv), private unaided school would be entitled to be reimbursed with the expenditure incurred by it in providing free and compulsory education to children belonging to the above category to the extent of per child expenditure incurred by the State in a school specified in Section 2(n)(i) or the actual amount charged from the child, whichever is less. Such a restriction is in the interest of the general public. It is also a reasonable restriction. Such measures address two aspects, viz., upholding the fundamental right of the private management to establish an unaided educational institution of their choice and, at the same time, securing the interests of the children in the locality, in particular, those who may not be able to pursue education due to inability to pay fees or charges of the private unaided schools.  [Para 10]\n\nTo compel the unaided non minority and minority private educational institutions, to admit 25% of the students on the fee structure determined by the State, is nothing but an invasion as well as appropriation of the rights guaranteed to them under Article 19(1)(g) and Article 30(1) of the Constitution. Legislature cannot under the guise of interest of general public \"arbitrarily cast burden or responsibility on private citizens running a private school, totally unaided\". Section 12(1)(c) was enacted not only to offload or outsource the constitutional obligation of the State to the private unaided educational institutions, but also to burden them with duties which they do not constitutionally owe to children included in Section 2(d) or (e) of the Act or to their parents.  [Para 133]\n\nRight to establish and administer and run a private unaided educational institution is the very openness of personal freedom and opportunity which is constitutionally protected, which right cannot be robbed or coerced against the will of citizens at the threat of non-recognition or non-affiliation. Right to establish a private unaided educational institution and to make reasonable profit is recognized by Article 19(1)(g) so as to achieve economic security and stability even if it is for charity. Rights protected under Article 19(1)(g) are fundamental in nature, inherent and are sacred and valuable rights of citizens which can be abridged only to the extent that is necessary to ensure public peace, health, morality etc. and to the extent of the constitutional limitation provided in that Article.   [Para 135]\n\nSection 12(1)(c) is not a restriction which falls under Article 19(6) but cast a burden on private unaided educational institutions to admit and teach children at the state dictate, on a fee structure determined by the State which, would abridge and destroy the freedom guaranteed to them under Article 19(1)(g) of the Constitution. Reimbursement of fees at the Government rate is not an answer when the unaided private educational institutions have no constitutional obligation and their Constitutional rights are invaded.

                "description": "Reservation of 25% seats in Class-1 for children of weaker section - Validity, with reference to Minority Schools - Held, reservation is not valid qua Unaided Minority Schools - However, such reservation would be valid in respect of Aided Minority Schools - Principle of severability would apply. \n\nS. H. Kapadia, C.J.I. & Swatanter Kumar, J. :-\n\nK. S. Radhakrishnan, J. :-\n\nAs to Unaided Minority Schools :- \n\nArticle 15(5) is an enabling provision and it is for the respective States either to enact a legislation or issue an executive instruction providing for reservation except in the case of minority educational institutions referred to in Article 30(1). The intention of the Parliament is that the minority educational institution referred to in Article 30(1) is a separate category of institutions which needs protection of Article 30(1) and viewed in that light unaided minority school(s) needs special protection under Article 30(1). Article 30(1) is not conditional as Article 19(1)(g). Article 30(1) is absolute as the Constitution framers thought that it was the duty of the Government of the day to protect the minorities in the matter of preservation of culture, language and script via establishment of educational institutions for religious and charitable purposes [See: Article 26]. Reservations of 25% in such unaided minority schools result in changing the character of the schools if right to establish and administer such schools flows from the right to conserve the language, script or culture, which right is conferred on such unaided minority schools. Thus, the 2009 Act including Section 12(1) (c) violates the right conferred on such unaided minority schools under Article 30(1).\n\nAs to Aided Minority Schools :-\n\nHowever, when it comes to aided minority schools we have to keep in mind Article 29(2). Article 30(1) is subject to Article 29(2). The said Article confers right of admission upon every citizen into a State-aided educational institution. Article 29(2) refers to an individual right. It is not a class right. It applies when an individual is denied admission into an educational institution maintained or aided by the State. The 2009 Act is enacted to remove barriers such as financial barriers which restrict his/her access to education. It is enacted pursuant to Article 21A. Applying the above tests, it is held that the 2009 Act is constitutionally valid qua aided minority schools.\n\n1957 SCR 930 Ref. to.  [Para 19,20]\n\nAs to Unaided Minority Schools :- \n\nPai Foundation [(2002)8 SCC 481] and Inamdar [(2005) 6 SCC 537] have categorically held that any action of the State to regulate or control admissions in the unaided professional educational institutions, so as to compel them to give up a share of the available seats to the candidates chosen by the State, as if it was filling the seats available to be filled up at its discretion in such private institutions, would amount to nationalization of seats. Such imposition of quota of State seats or enforcing reservation policy of the State on available seats in unaided professional institutions, it was held, are acts constituting serious encroachment on the right and autonomy of private unaided professional educational institutions and such appropriation of seats cannot be held to be a regulatory measure in the interest of minority within the meaning of Article 30(1) or a reasonable restriction within the meaning of Article 19(6) of the Constitution, so far as the unaided minority institutions are concerned.  [Para 122]\n\nTherefore, so far as unaided educational institutions both minority and non-minority are concerned the obligation cast under Section 12(1)(c) is only directory and the said provision is accordingly read down holding that it is open to the private unaided educational institutions, both minority and non-minority, at their volition to admit children who belong to the weaker sections and disadvantaged group in the neighbourhood in their educational institutions as well as in pre-schools.  [Para 142]\n\nAs to Aided Minority Schools :- \n\nSection 12(1)(b) deals with the schools receiving aid or grants to meet whole or part of its expenses from the appropriate government or local authority. Those schools are bound to provide free and compulsory elementary education to such proportion of children subject to a minimum of 25% depending upon its annual recurring aid or grants so received. So far as private aided educational institutions, both minority and non-minority are concerned, it has been clearly held in Pai Foundation (2002)8 SCC 481that once aid is provided to those institutions by the Government or any state agency, as a condition of grant or aid, they can put fetters on the freedom in the matter of administration and management of the institution. Aided institutions cannot obtain the extent of autonomy in relation to the management and administration as would be available to a private unaided institution. The Court also held in St. Stephen [(1992) 1 SCC 558] by admitting a member of a non minority into a minority institution, it does not shed its character and cease to be a minority institution and such \"sprinkling of outsiders\" would enable the distinct language, script and culture of a minority to be propagated amongst non members of a particular community and would indeed better serve the object of serving the language, religion and culture of that minority. Additionally, Section 12(1)(b) equally safeguards the rights of the members of religious and linguistic minority communities. Section 2(e) deals with the 'child belonging to weaker section' of the minority communities, religious or linguistic, who would also get the benefit of Section 12(1)(b) and, therefore, the contention that Section 12(1)(b), as such, would stand against the interest of the religious and linguistic minority communities is unfounded.

S. Radhakrishnan, J. :-\n\nRights guaranteed to the unaided non-minority and minority educational institutions under Article 19(1)(g) and Article 30(1)  have now been limited, restricted and curtailed so as to impose positive obligation on them under Section 12(1) (c) of the Act and under Article 21A of the Constitution, which is permissible only through constitutional amendment.  [Para 103]\n\nThe purpose and object of the Act is laudable, that is, social inclusiveness in the field of elementary education but the means adopted to achieve that objective is faulty and constitutionally impermissible. Possibly, the object and purpose of the Act could be achieved by limiting or curtailing the fundamental rights guaranteed to the unaided non-minority and minority educational institutions under Article 19(1)(g) and Article 30(1) or imposing a positive obligation on them under Article 21A, but this has not been done in the instant case.  [Para 128]\n\nParliament can enact a social legislation to give effect to the Directive Principles of the State Policy, but so far as the present case is concerned , neither the Directive Principles o f the State Policy nor Article 21A cast any duty or obligation on the unaided private educational institutions to provide free and compulsory education to children o f the age o f 6 to 14 . Section 12(1)(c ) has , therefore , no foundation either on the  Directive  Principles  of the State Policy or Article 21A o f the Constitution, so as to rope in unaided educational institutions. Directive Principles of the State Policy as well as Article 21A cast the constitutional obligation on the State and State alone. State, cannot offload or outsource that Constitutional obligation to the private unaided educational institutions and the same can be done only by a constitutional provision and not by an ordinary legislation.

In the instant case, merely addressing the letters, would not by any stretch of imagination mean compliance with the principles of natural justice.  There is nothing in the order dated 31st October, 1996 which would indicate that prior opportunity was given to the petitioner before adjustments were made from the terminal dues/benefits admissible to him.  In this view of the matter, the conclusion of the Tribunal that opportunity was given or that there was no dispute about the dues is contrary to the material placed on record and wholly erroneous.  It is difficult to agree with the conclusion of Tribunal on this aspect.   [Para 22]"

It is true that the Commissioner of Police has suspended the licences in respect of the Petitioners' establishments without giving any notice to them. However these licences came to be suspended relying upon the report of the Chief Fire Officer.\n\n\tThe scheme of the Fire Safety Act is a complete code in itself which provides for steps to be taken before any premises which are not complying with fire safety norms are sealed. Section 5 provides for notice to be issued to the establishment regarding fire prevention and life safety measures whereunder a show cause notice is required to be given with time-frame to comply with any short-falls. Section 6 provides for steps to be taken in the event of non compliance of notice and section 8 provides for last steps of sealing the building.\n\nAdmittedly, the procedure stated hereinabove is not followed by Respondent No.2 and instead report is sent to the Commissioner of Police whereupon the Commissioner of Police has invoked the powers under Rule 222(2) of the said Rules and suspended the Petitioners' above mentioned licences. Under Rule-222(1) of the said Rules, the licensing authority is authorised to suspend or cancel any licence granted under the said Rules for the contravention of any of the rules only after providing an opportunity of hearing. Sub-rule (2) of Rule-222 makes an exception to sub-rule (1) in case the licensing authority is of the opinion that the compliances in terms of protection against and for extinguishing fire are inadequate or in any way insufficient or in unsatisfactory condition. These Rules are applicable to the premises and performance licences and has no application to the eating house licence issued by the Municipal Corporation or the police licence issued by the Commissioner of Police. These licences could not have been suspended without giving an opportunity of hearing to the Petitioners. I have already recorded a finding that the Petitioners have complied with the requisitions sought by the Chief Fire Officer vide his notice dated 14th July 2014. If the Chief Fire Officer was of the opinion that the certificates submitted by the Petitioners are not in compliance with the Fire Safety Act, then, of course, the Chief Fire Officer could have issued notice and taken steps as provided in sections 7 and 8 of the Fire Safety Act, instead, the Chief Fire Officer sent the report to the Commissioner of Police. In fact, the notices under section 5 were issued by the Fire Department pursuant to the request made by the Commissioner of Police vide his letter dated 27th June 2014. In these circumstances the Commissioner of Police was not justified in suspending the Petitioners' licences without giving an opportunity of hearing to the Petitioners to show cause as to why their licences should not be suspended.

Firing a second and third shot by rifle after the first shot penetrating a vital part of the body, damaging the internal organs of the body cannot be said to be acts in pursuance of any provisions of the Railway Protection Force Act, 1957 or the rules framed thereunder.  Pumping of bullet shots one after another cannot also be said to be acts in excess of the private defence because the right of private defence would cease after the deceased was shot through and through his chest.  A 303 rifle is not anautomatic weapon.  The bolt of this rifle has to be pushed back and again pushed forward and this can only be intentional act with an object of firing the rifle.  The facts of the case indicate that the accused in the defence tried to justify his acts.  As far as the second shot is concerned, accused contended that he did not know whether his first bullet had hit the deceased.  But as far as third bullet is concerned, his story that he shot the third bullet at the body who was running away is clearly falsified by the circumstances of three bullet injuries being found on the deceased.  Such an act after cessession of the right of private defence cannot be said to be something done or intended to be done under the powers conferred by or in pursuance of any provision of the Railway Protection Force Act, 1957 or the rules thereunder and therefore, the argument based upon the provision of Section 20(3) of the Railway Protection Force Act, 1957 must fail.\t [Para 11]"

By virtue of Rule 10.28, the provisions of Order XXI CPC, are also made applicable to the proceedings before the Claims Tribunal. That apart, it has been specifically provided that in so far as the Act and the Rules make no provision or make insufficient provision, the relevant provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 shall so far as may be, apply to the proceedings before the Claims Tribunal. \n\n\tFurther, as per clause (4) of Rule 10.22, where an application is made to the Claims Tribunal in this behalf or otherwise, the Tribunal is satisfied that on account of the negligence of the children on the part of the parents or on account of variation of the circumstances of the dependent or for any other sufficient cause, an order of the Tribunal as to distribution of any sum paid as compensation or as to manner in which sum payable to any such dependent is to be invested, applied or otherwise dealt with ought to be varied, the Tribunal may make such order for variation of the former order as it thinks fit just in the circumstances of the case. \t [Para 13,14]\n\n\tIt is true that after passing the award, the Tribunal becomes functus officio and it cannot review the determination for entitlement of compensation under the award. But then, so far as the order directing disbursement of the amount of compensation already determined is concerned, it is open to be reconsidered and varied by the Tribunal where it is found just in the circumstances of the case in the interest of the claimants.\n\n\tIt is the duty of the Tribunal to ensure that the compensation awarded by it is disbursed to the rightful claimant in the manner directed by it and therefore, during the execution of the award passed, if the petitioner had applied for the correction of her name in the award on the strength of the documentary evidence, there was absolutely no reason for the Tribunal to decline to entertain the application made. The Tribunal is empowered to grant such amendment invoking the power under the Rules 10.22(4) & 10.27 of the Rules as also the inherent power under Section 151 & 153 of Civil Procedure Code, 1908, while executing the award, which in no manner affects adversely the rights of the non-claimants. \t [Para 15,16]"

The authority, should be understood on its plain language and without necessarily curtailing its scope. It will be more appropriate to understand this expression and give it a meaning which should be in conformity with the context and purpose in which it has been used. The 'other authority' appearing in Rule 9(2) is intended to cover a vast field and there is no indication of the mind of the framers that the expression must be given a restricted or a narrow meaning. It is possible that where the authority is vested in a person or a body as a result of delegation, then delegatee of such authority has to work strictly within the field delegated. If it works beyond the scope of delegation, in that event it will be beyond the authority and may even, in given circumstances vitiate the action.   [Para 24]\n\nThe words of the rule, therefore, should be explicit or the intent should be irresistibly expressed for exclusion. If it was so intended, the framers of the rule could simply use the expression like 'public servant in office' or 'an authority in office'. Absence of such specific language exhibits the mind of the framers that they never intended to restrict the scope of 'other authority' by limiting it to the serving officers/officials. The principle of necessary implication further requires that the exclusion should be an irresistible conclusion and should also be in conformity with the purpose and object of the rule.   [Para 26]\n\nThe language of Rule 9(2) does not debar specifically or even by necessary implication appointment of a former employee of the Railways as Inquiry Officer. Even if, for the sake of argument, it is assumed otherwise, all the respondents have participated in the departmental inquiries without protest and it is only after the orders of the competent authority have been passed that they have raised this objection before the Courts. In the light of the peculiar facts and circumstances of the present case, it is obligatory upon the respondents to show that they have suffered some serious prejudice because of appointment of retired Railway Officers as Inquiry Officers. The respondents have no way satisfied this test of law. Thus, if their argument was to be accepted on the interpretation of Rule 9(2), which we have specifically objected, even then the inquiries conducted and the order passed thereupon would not be vitiated for this reason.

The language of Rule 9(2), on its plain reading shows that the words are disjunctive and, therefore, this principle of interpretation would be hardly applicable to the facts of the present case. It is also incorrect to suggest, much less to argue, that under Rule 9 (2) a discreet choice is vested under the authority concerned. The Act is applicable to a special class of persons while Rules are applicable to other class of persons including Grade-A to Grade-D. Once the provisions of the Act are attracted, a public inquiry has to be held in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The Rules and the Act, as self-contained Codes within themselves, operate in a way without impinging upon the field of the other. There is hardly any discretion vested in the competent authority, it is only for the purposes of conducting an inquiry personally or through some other appointed authority that the discretion is vested. In the event of delegation by the competent authority, the delegatee authority has to function within the limit of the authority delegated to it. Neither in the Rules nor in the provisions of the Act which are independent in their application, there is any requirement or even suggestion that appointment of an authority or Board has to be essentially of a person in service, even a former employee could be so appointed.

It would not be permissible to import any meaning or make additions to the plain and simple language of Rule 9(2) in relation to \"other authority.\" The rule of contextual interpretation requires that the court should examine every word of statute in its context, while keeping in mind the preamble of the statute, other provisions thereof, pari materia statutes, if any, and the mischief intended to be remedied. Context often provides a key to the meaning of the word and the sense it carries. It is also a well established and cardinal principle of construction that when the rules and regulations have been framed dealing with different aspects of the service of the employees, the Courts would attempt to make a harmonious construction and try to save the provision, not strike it down rendering the provision ineffective. The Court would normally adopt an interpretation which is in line with the purpose of such regulations. The rule of contextual interpretation can be purposefully applied to the language of Rule 9(2), particularly to examine the merit in the contentions raised by respondent before us.

A practice which is uniformly applied and is in the larger public interest may introduce an element of fairness. A good practice of the past can even provide good guidance for future. This accepted principle can safely be applied to a case where the need so arises, keeping in view the facts of that case. There can be hardly any doubt that the practice of appointing former employees had been implemented for quite some time in the Department. We are unable to see how this practice is opposed to any statutory provision or even public policy.

Without any further inquiry or opportunity of hearing, the Inquiry Officer opined that the service card was fake.  Punishment of removal from service was imposed by the disciplinary authority and confirmed by the Appellate Authority.  At the instance of Appellant the Central Administrative Tribunal directed reinstatement holding that the disciplinary authority having differed with the Inquiry Officer was enjoined to record reasons and own findings on the charge.  Respondent's writ petition was allowed.  In appeal, the Supreme Court ruled that the disciplinary authority being a statutory authority was bound to act within the four corners of the statute.  Inquiry Officer could not have arrived at a different finding, when no further opportunity was given to Appellant and no reason was recorded therefor.

In the absence of evidence to show that such a distance could cause loss of visibility and audibility, out right rejection of his evidence is improper. Moreover, the witness blurted out about such distance by his approximation without measurement thereof.\n\nNot only that the Tribunal has reappreciated the evidence as if it is an appellate authority but appears to have applied incorrect standard of proof for substitution of its own conclusion/finding. In Departmental Enquiry the standard of proof required is only of \"preponderance of probability\". There cannot be a requirement of proof beyond doubt as appears to have been expected by the Tribunal. Even in the case of a criminal trial the requirement is of proof beyond a reasonable doubt but the Tribunal appears to have applied standard of proof reaching to the hilt i.e. reaching point \"beyond doubt\". Needless to say the Tribunal has committed jurisdictional error while reappreciating the whole facts and reaching its own conclusions on application of erroneous yardstick of required amount of proof in the Departmental Enquiry. It follows that the findings of the Tribunal are improper and incorrect due to such wrong approach.\n\nThe Tribunal had no jurisdiction to reappreciate the evidence and set aside the order of the Disciplinary Authority. The Respondent was not prejudiced, in any way, due to non-observance of Rule 9(21) in stricto-sensu since he was fully aware of the circumstances which appeared against him and could have offered himself for examination or might have explained the circumstances through his written statement.

The Rule clearly indicates that this requirement is applicable in the case of property standing in the name of the employee or any member of his family. The contention of the petitioner that in case of property standing in the name of HUF, it is not necessary to inform the Railway Authorities, therefore, cannot be accepted. Railway employee has to disclose the information about his property at the time of joining service which is indicated in Rule 18(1). The petitioner has been exonerated of the charge which is levelled against him under Rule 18(1) by the CAT. So far as Rule 18(2) is concerned, it is in respect of property while the employee is in service. The underlying purpose of the rule is clearly to keep the Railway Authorities informed about any transaction of purchase and sale of property while the employee is in service so as to keep a track of assets acquired or sold by the employee and further to ensure transparency in such transactions. Admittedly, the petitioner did not give prior information about the sale of flats by him in respect of his HUF property which he developed and later on sold. The contention of the petitioner that the respondent already had prior knowledge about the said development and sale of the property is not borne out of the record and the petitioner could not point out a single document to substantiate his claim. The petitioner invited our attention to the charge which was framed against him and submitted that the charge itself indicated that the respondent was aware about the said transaction. This submission of the petitioner cannot be accepted as the requirement of Rule 18(2) is that before the said transaction takes place, prior information has to be given to the railway authorities which admittedly has not been done. There is no infirmity, therefore, in the finding recorded by the Enquiry Officer which is confirmed by the appellate authority as well as by the CAT. There is neither any error of jurisdiction nor any legal error committed by the CAT and as such, there is no reason to interfere with the finding recorded by the Tribunal.  (1997)9 SCC 31 - Ref. to.

The mother of the petitioner has only divorced his biological father and after remarriage he has become the step-son of his step-father, who cannot replace the biological father but the things would have been different had it been a case of adoption because as per Section 12 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956.\n\nPerusal of S.9 of 1956 Act it transpires that even if there is a divorce between biological parents of the petitioner, in the presence of the biological father, the step-father of the petitioner cannot give the petitioner in adoption with his biological mother. Even under Section 8 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, the step-son is neither Class-I nor Class-II heir.\n\nThus, from the aforesaid discussion, it transpires that correction in the Birth Certificate in the Register of Births and Deaths of the adoptive parents can be made if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Registrar, that too in accordance with the other terms and conditions mentioned in Section 15 of the Act but the entry of a step-father, replacing the name of the biological father in the Birth Certificate maintained under the Act, cannot be made. \t [Para 8,9,13,14]"

                "description": "Industrial Employment (Standing Orders) Act (1946), S.5 - Jurisdiction of Civil Court - Suit challenging termination of service of employee by Corporation - Jurisdiction of Civil Court would depend on facts of the case.\n\nSection 9 of the Code is in enforcement of the fundamental principles of law laid down in the maxim Ubi jus Ibi remedium. A litigant, thus, having a grievance of a civil nature has a right to institute a civil suit in a competent civil court unless its cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred by any statute. Ex facie, in terms of Section 9 of the Code, civil courts can try all suits, unless bared by statute, either expressly or by necessary implication. The civil court, furthermore, being a court of plenary jurisdiction has the jurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction upon considering the averments made in the plaint but that would not mean that the plaintiff can circumvent the provisions of law in order to invest jurisdiction on the civil court although it otherwise may not possess. For the said purpose, the court in given cases would be entitled to decide the question of its own jurisdiction upon arriving at a finding in regard to the existence of the jurisdictional fact. It is also well settled that there is a presumption that a civil court will have jurisdiction and the ouster of civil court's jurisdiction is not to be readily inferred. A person taking a plea contra must establish the same. Even in a case where jurisdiction of a civil court is sought to be barred under a statute, the civil court can exercise its jurisdiction in respect of some matters particularly when the statutory authority or Tribunal acts without jurisdiction.  [Para 9,10]\n\nA dispute arising in between an employer and employee may or may not be an industrial dispute. The dispute may be in relation to or arising out of a fundamental right of the employee, or his right under a Parliamentary Act and the Regulations framed thereunder, and/or a right arising under the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act or the sister laws and may relate to same or similar rights or different rights, or even may be based on common law right or contractual right. The question in regard to the jurisdiction of the civil court must, therefore, be addressed having regard to the fact as to which rights or obligations are sought to be enforced for the purpose of invoking or excluding the jurisdiction of a civil court. [Para 21]\n\nIf an employee intends to enforce his constitutional rights or a right under a statutory Regulation, the civil court will have the necessary jurisdiction to try a suit. If, however, he claims his right and corresponding obligations only in terms of the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act or the sister laws so called, the civil court will have none. In this view of the matter, it would not be correct to contend that only because the employee concerned is also a workman within the meaning of the provisions of the 1947 Act or the conditions of his service are otherwise governed by the Standing Order certified under the 1946 Act ipso facto the Civil Court will have no jurisdiction. If the infringement of Standing Order or other provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act are alleged, the civil court's jurisdiction may be held to be barred but if the suit is based on the violation of principles of common law or constitutional provisions or on other grounds, the civil court's jurisdiction may not be held to be barred. If no right is claimed under a special statute in terms whereof the jurisdiction of the civil court is barred, the civil court will have jurisdiction. Where the relationship between the parties as employer and employee is contractual, right to enforce the contract of service depending on personal volition of an employer, is prohibited in terms of Section 14(1)(b) of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. It has, however, four exceptions, namely, (1) when an employee enjoys a status, i.e., his conditions of service are governed by the rules framed under the proviso appended to Article 309 of the Constitution of India or a statute and would otherwise be governed by Article 311(2) of the Constitution of India; (2) where the conditions of service are governed by statute or statutory Regulation and in the event mandatory provisions thereof have been breached; (3) when the service of the employee is otherwise protected by a statute; and (4) where a right is claimed under the Industrial Disputes Act or sister laws, termination of service having been effected in breach of the provisions thereof. Appellant-Corporation is bound to comply with the mandatory provisions of the statute or the regulations framed under it. A subordinate legislation when validly framed becomes a part of the Act. It is also bound to follow the principles of natural justice. In the event it is found that the action on the part of State is violative of the constitutional provisions or the mandatory requirements of a statute or statutory rules, the civil court would have the jurisdiction to direct reinstatement with full back wages.   [Para 23]\n\nFurther, the rights and obligations of the employer having arisen under two Parliamentary Acts, the question of invoking the provisions of Article 254(1) of the Constitution of India would also not arise herein. Provisions of both the statutes must be given effect to.   [Para 25]\n\nWhere the conditions of service are governed by two statutes, the effect thereof on an order passed against an employee/workman in violation of a rule which would attract both the statutes. An attempt shall be made in a case of that nature to apply the principles of 'Harmonious Construction\".   [Para 24]\n\nThe application of doctrine of prospective overruling may not be correct because either a Court has the requisite jurisdiction or it does not have. It is well settled principle of law that the court cannot confer jurisdiction where there is none and neither can the parties confer jurisdiction upon a Court by consent. If a Court decides a matter without jurisdiction the same would be nullity and, thus, the doctrine of prospective overruling shall not apply in such cases. Even otherwise doctrine of prospective overruling has a limited application. It ordinarily applies where a statute is declared ultra vires and not in a case where the decree or order is passed by a Court/Tribunal in respect whereof it had no jurisdiction.  1995(5) SCC 75 - Overruled.

                "description": "Regulations under - Circular nos. 15/95 dt. 4-4-95, 17/96 dt. 24-6-96, 52/80 dt. 21-8-80 - Drivers - Selection - Interviews not conducted as per Circular no.52/80 - 300 candidates interviewed in one day with batch of 4-5 candidates interviewed at one time - Change in procedure effected without government's sanction - Select list quashed.\n\nConstitution of India, Arts. 14, 16.\n\nThe petitioners in the instant case had applied for the posts of drivers advertised by the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation. They had undergone driving test and personal interview, but were not selected. From the documents, charts showing the marks obtained by the petitioners and other candidates, it is seen that the petitioners have secured 90 per cent or more marks in driving or trade test. Almost all selected candidates have obtained less marks than the petitioners in the driving test. The Corporation has followed the procedure contained in Circular No.15/95. All the petitioners would have been selected as per Circular No.52/80 dated 21st August 1980 regarding the Screening Committee for selection of drivers, in which a very detailed and elaborate procedure is given for screening of candidates. The Corporation has taken the personal interviews of all the candidates who have been declared passed in the trade test on one day. A statement was made that 4 to 5 candidates were asked to stand in a row before the Interview Committee, at the same time for the purpose of interview. It is practically impossible for the Interview Committee to interview all the candidates in one day. i.e. more than 300 candidate. It is therefore clear that the interview committee has not followed the procedure regarding interview of the candidates as laid down in Circular No.52/80 dated 21st August 1980. The rules are statutory. There is no resolution of the Corporation for effecting a change. There is also no prior permission from the Government for effecting the change. Apparently the interview procedure adopted in this case was a farce.\n\nThe Respondent Corporation has followed a consistent policy of allotting initially 60 per cent and later on 87 1/2 per cent marks for written/trade test for the post of Driver. An advertisement in this regard was published in the newspapers on 20-9-1995. When the candidates including the petitioners applied for the said post, Circular No.15/95 dated 4-4-1995 was in operation and this Circular No.15/95 was issued as the change was effected by the Government. Therefore, the weightage of marks secured by the candidates in the written trade test was given to the candidates. There are no directives of the State Government and also no resolution is passed by the Corporation for effecting any change in the procedure and for the first time, with a view to deny such a weightage to the candidates, the respondent Corporation has issued the Circular No.17/96 dated 24-6-1996 and that too, without any sanction or directives from the State Government and without any resolution of the Corporation. The stand, that marks cannot be allotted in the trade test, taken in this Circular 17/96 is contrary to the policy/procedure of selection which was consistently followed by the respondent Corporation. Even the learned Counsel for the respondents has submitted that the candidates who secured 50 per cent marks in trade test are declared as \"passed\" and those who secure below 50 per cent marks are declared as \"failed\" which indicates that marks can be allotted in a trade test. This Circular No.17/96 is clearly defective, invalid and the selection made on the basis of such an invalid circular is illegal and arbitrary. The Circular No.17/96 being not retrospective, it cannot adversely affect the right of the petitioners for being considered for selection. The petitioners have a right for being considered for selection. Eventhough the petitioners participated in the process of selection by way of written test, the petitioners are certainly entitled to agitate their claim as the Corporation has adopted a wrong procedure. The selection is made in an unfair and injudicious manner. The Selection Committee and also the selected candidates are not entitled to be heard and therefore, non-pleading of selected candidates is not bad in law as they cannot claim to have a right to be heard. As the candidate in the select list does not acquire any indefeasible right for appointment, the select list therefore requires to be set aside. The selection for the post of Drivers is not made according to the prescribed and consistent procedure and therefore, the select list requires to be quashed and set aside.  [Para 16,17,18]"

                "description": "Bombay State Transport Employees' Service Regulations, Regn. 65(1), 67(1) - Helpers appointed in daily rated scales after 1-1-86 - Absorption in temporary/regular time scale and revision of their pay scales - They are governed by cl. 19 of 1985 settlement and not by Cl. 49 of 1956 settlement - Cl. 19 of 1985 settlement does not violate Regulations 65(a), 67(1) and Arts. 14, 39(d) of Constitution - Having accepted benefits under 1985 settlement, cannot challenge it. \n\nIndustrial Disputes Act (1947), S.18 , Constitution of India, Arts. 14, 39(d).\n\nIn instant case all the petitioners have joined on or after 1-1-1986 as helpers in daily rated scales with the Maharashtra State Road Transport Corporation and they have admittedly been beneficiaries of the 1985, 1989 and 1994 Settlements arrived at between the corporation and employees' Unions. As a result of all these three Settlements, they have been fixed in the temporary time scale, regular time scale and their pay has been revised upwards each time. By way of pay fixation or revision of pay none of the petitioners has been put to disadvantage financially. The petitioners have been employed by the Corporation only from 1-1-1986 onwards and the Settlement of 1985 governs their service conditions. Clause 49 of the 1956 Settlement regarding absorption in regular service of the Corporation on completion of 180 days of continuous service has been reviewed and replaced by Clause 19 of the 1985 Settlement. The petitioners, therefore, cannot invoke Clause 49 of 1956 Settlement and their challenge to the five Clauses of 1989 Settlement, based on Clause 49 of 1956 Settlement, is, therefore, invalid. As far as the petitioners are concerned, their absorption in temporary time scale or regular time scale is covered by clause 19 of 1985 Settlement and they cannot rely upon any earlier Settlement signed between the Corporation and the Unions.  [Para 12]\n\nClause 19 of the 1985 Settlement, if read correctly, does not give an automatic right of fixation in the time scale on completion of 180 days of continuous service. The said absorption in the time scale is subject to selection by the Selection Committee, availability of posts and merits of individual cases. when the petitioners have been fixed in the temporary time scale or regular time scale in pursuance of 1985 settlement, fixation of their salary has not resulted into reduction of their pay packet at any time and they have been given the protection of Regulation No. 67(1) of the Service Regulations. Thus the Corporation has not acted in breach of either Regulation 65(a) while petitioners were appointed as helpers or Regulation 67(1) when the petitioners were absorbed in the temporary time scale or regular time scale in terms of the settlement of 1985.  [Para 14,15]\n\nThe 1989 Settlement has not resulted into any financial loss to any of the petitioners and, therefore, challenge to the relevant Clauses is without any merit. There is no case made out to show that any provision of 1985 or 1989 Settlement is in breach of fundamental rights guaranteed under Articles 14, 16 and 21 of the Constitution.  [Para 16]\n\nThe petitioners were not eligible to be fixed in regular time scale unless the condition of Clause 19 of the 1985 Settlement were satisfied and all of them have been absorbed in the time scale only in pursuance of the said Clause. They did not have the right for absorption in the time scale unless the conditions in Clause 19 of the 1985 Settlement were satisfied. In such circumstances, the petitioners are not entitled to invoke the principle of equal pay for equal work.  The Settlements of which the petitioners have been beneficiaries cannot be challenged by the petitioners by picking up one or few clauses on the ground that they are unfair or illegal.  [Para 17,19]\n\nNone of the petitioners has ever raised any dispute against any term of these Settlements either before the Corporation and/or authority/Court. They have accepted the benefits of the Settlements whole-heartedly and they are bound by these Settlements. It is too late for the petitioners to turn back and say that the impugned Clauses of the 1989 Settlement are illegal and that the Corporation has acted in breach of any service Regulation or has taken away the fundamental rights of the petitioners regarding their pay fixation or absorption in the time scale. The challenge of the petitioners is, therefore, illegal and devoid of merits. A few individual employees have no locus standi to challenge such settlements entered into between the Management and recognised Unions after collective bargaining, specially when the same individuals have enjoyed the benefits of the Settlements for a number of years.

Section 34 of the Act does not confer such a power to frame rules to debar lawyer for professional misconduct. The amendment made by providing Rule 14(A)(vii) to (xii) is not authorized under the Advocate Act. The High Court has no power to exercise the disciplinary control. It would amount to usurpation of the power of Bar Council conferred under Advocates Act. However, the High Court may punish advocate for contempt and then debar him from practicing for such specified period as may be permissible in accordance with law, but without exercising contempt jurisdiction by way of disciplinary control no punishment can be imposed.

Section 34 does not confer such power of debarment by way of disciplinary methods or disciplinary inquiry as against an advocate as that has to be dealt with by the Bar Council as provided in other sections in a different chapter of the Act. It is only when the advocate is found guilty of contempt of court, as provided in Rule 14 as existed in the Madras High Court Rules, 1970 takes care of situation until and unless an advocate who has committed contempt of court purges himself of contempt shall not be entitled to appear or act or plead in the Court. The debarment cannot be ordered by the High Court until and unless advocate is prosecuted under the Contempt of Courts Act. It cannot be resorted to by undertaking disciplinary proceedings as contemplated under the Rules 14-A to 14-D as amended in 2016. That is a clear usurpation of the power of the Bar Council and is wholly impermissible. (1998) 4 SCC 409 Foll. \t [Para 69,70,77,78]"

The contention of the learned counsel for the Petitioner is that at the highest, that may have been possible if the recovery is to be made in the same State.  However, as it is not government dues, the recovery cannot be made as arrears of land revenue in the district which is not falling in the State of Gujarat.  The language of Section 3 and 5 of the Recovery Act makes it clear that not only arrears of land revenue can be recovered under the Recovery Act but all sums recoverable as arrears of land revenue.  In other words, any amount can be recovered, as long as it is the amount which is capable of being recovered as arrears of land revenue.  In the instant case, the Development Act itself permits the recovery of dues as arrears of land revenue.  Once that be the case, the amount would fall under the expression \"sum recoverable as arrears of land revenue\".  The purpose behind the Revenue Recovery Act is to enable the Collector of District wherein the property is situated to recover from the defaulter all sums of money which are capable of being recovered either as land revenue or which can be recovered as arrears of land revenue.  The object behind it is that there must be public mechanism or body which can recover the amounts from a defaulter in a district where he has property considering that these are public dues.

Article 39 (e) provides for ensuring health and strength for women. Keeping in mind the \"Laxman Rekha\" in the matter of interpretation of provisions of Personal Laws - qua the Constitution, the above constitutional provisions obligate the State for uplifting the women and secure descent living for them. Rule 75 provides for grant of pension even to the second wife/widow of a deceased railway servant along with first wife. This provision of Rule 75 made by the Indian Railways cannot be held to be in conflict or interdiction with Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act. On the contrary, for achieving the constitutional goal, as aforesaid, even for the unfortunate second wife/widow, Rule 75 provides for grant of pension to her for her survival in life. At any rate, it must be seen that by virtue of Rule 75, the payment of pension to the two widows is required to be made in equal share, which clearly shows that there is no burden on the treasury or the Indian Railways by inserting the said noble idea. There is no reason for us to hold that Rule 75 violates Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, or that it is contrary to the Hindu Marriage Act, since it does not even remotely provides for any contradiction or interdiction therewith.

However, Rule 20 is attracted when a person is appointed to the post in any of the above capacities. Rule 20 has no application when appointment is not against any post. When a casual labour is granted a temporary status, grant of a status confers various privileges as enumerated in para 2005 of IREM. One of the benefits enumerated in para 2005 sub clause (a) is also to make him eligible to count only half of the services rendered by him after attaining temporary status. Rule 20 is thus clearly not attracted in a case where only a temporary status is granted to casual worker and no appointment is made in any capacity against any post. The Delhi High Court in the impugned judgment also relies on proviso to Rule 20 which states, \"Provided that officiating or temporary service is followed, without interruption, by substantive appointment in the same or in another service or post.\" \t [Para 40,41]\n\n\tThe above Proviso has to be read along with the main Rule 20, when main Rule 20 contemplates commencement of qualifying service from the date he takes charge of the post, the appointment to a post is implicit and a condition precedent. The proviso put another different condition that officiating or temporary service is followed, without interruption, by substantive appointment in the same or another service or post. The proviso cannot be read independent to the main provision nor it can mean that by only grant of temporary status a casual employee is entitled to reckon his service of temporary status for purpose of pensionary benefit. \t\t [Para 42]\n\n\tAs observed, the grant of temporary status of casual labour is not akin to appointment against a post and such contingency is not covered by Rule 20 and the same is expressly covered by Rule 31 which provides for \"half the service paid from contingencies shall be taken into account for calculating pensionary benefits on absorption in regular employment subject to certain conditions enumerated there in.\" Thus Rule 31 is clearly applicable while computing the eligible services for calculating pensionary benefits on granting of temporary status. \t\t [Para 46]\n\n\tThe perusal of para 20 of the Master Circular No.54 of 94 also indicates that only half of the period of service of a casual labour after attainment of temporary status on completion of 120 days continuous service if it is followed by absorption in service as a regular Railway employee, counts for pensionary benefits. Para 2005 of Indian Railway Establishment Manual (IREM) also contains the same scheme for reckoning the period for pensionary benefit. \t [Para 28,29]\n\n\tThere is one more aspect of the matter which needs to be noted. There is specific rule in Rules, 1993 i.e. Rule 107, which empowers Pension Sanctioning Authority to approach the Ministry of Railways (Railway Board) for dispensing with or relaxing the requirement of any Rule operation of which causes hardship in any particular case. Hence, while allowing the appeal and setting aside the impugned judgment of the High Court it is left open to the Pension Sanctioning Authority to recommend for grant of relaxation under Rule 107 in deserving cases.\n\n2008 (2) SCC 108 Rel. on. 2004 (3) SCC 317 Disting. 2004 (1) SLR 2014 Overruled. \t [Para 49,50]"

The rules prohibit transfer of mining lease for consideration without the previous consent of competent authority in writing. Acquisition of mining lease contrary to rules is void. Requirement of previous consent cannot be ignored nor taken to be formality subject only to pay dead rent or agreeing to follow same terms. The lessee privately and unauthorisedly cannot sell its rights for consideration and profiteer from rights which belong to State.\n\nIn the present case, the original lessee sought transfer merely by disclosing that the partnership firm was to be transformed into a private limited company with the same partners continuing as directors and there was no direct or indirect consideration involved. It was specifically declared that no pecuniary advantage was being taken in the process which is clearly false. The permission to transfer the lease in favour of a private limited company was granted on that basis. Thus, it was a case of suppression veri and suggestio falsi. The original lessee did not disclose that the real purpose was not merely to change its partnership business into a private limited company as claimed but to privately transfer the lease by sale to a third party. Sale of shareholding by the newly formed company to another company, is a private unauthorized sale of mining lease which being in violation of rules is void. The statutory requirement is sought to be overcome with the plea that it was a transaction merely of transfer of shareholding when on the face of it the transaction is clearly that of sale of the mining lease.\n\nWhile discerning true nature of the entire transaction, court has not to merely see the form of the transaction which is of sale of shares but also the substance which is the private sale of mining rights avoiding legal bar against transfer of sale rights circumventing the mandatory consent of the competent authority. Consent of competent authority is not a formality and transfer without consent is void. The minerals vest in the State and mining lease can be operated strictly within the statutory framework. \n\nSince, the mining rights vest in the State, the State has to regulate transfer of such rights in the best interest of the people. No lessee can trade mining rights by adopting a device of forming a private limited company and transfer of entire shareholding only with a view to sell the mining rights for private profit as has happened in the present case. \t\t\t\t [Para 30,31,32,33,35,36]"

It was noted that his mother was landlady and afterwards his brother was recorded as owner of the property in the Municipal Record. He had not produced any document, power of attorney or any other authority to file application seeking permission to issue quit notice. Record reveals that in the judgment dated 15.01.1996 in appeal, the Additional Collector had not touched this issue and he allowed the appeal holding that the respondent was in arrears of rent, habitual defaulter and that the petitioner required the premises bonafide for his own occupation. Reviewing authority did not disturb any of these findings but allowed the review application on the ground that the petitioner had failed to prove that he was landlord or that he was Karta of the joint family and that the suit premises are the ancestral joint family property.

It is obvious that the provisions of the Act abundantly make it clear that the creation of the Tribunal was with a specific purpose, that purpose was to provide a  separate forum for adjudication of the disputes with Railway Administration regarding its functioning in the matter of transport, either of passengers or of goods and ancillary matters arising therefor, such as ; railway accident, loss of goods by Railway in transit etc,  what is to be dealt with by the Tribunal is made clear by the provisions of section 13.  In our opinion, therefore, the Railway Claims Tribunal is formed to administer justice in the matters of compensation, damages etc, arising out of fault of the Railway Administration.  The question which now falls for consideration is therefore as to whether a claim by a plaintiff, of damages against his agent and the Railway Administration, holding both responsible for the damages, is maintainable before the Railway Claims Tribunal ?  Another question which arises is whether the Railway Claims Tribunal has any jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the liability or responsibility of an individual or a company unconnected with the Railway Administration ?  On the basis of the provisions of section 13, we have no doubt that the Special Tribunal as created by the Special enactment will have only that jurisdiction which is conferred on it by the statute.  None of the provisions of Railway Claims Tribunal Act, 1987 set out any such jurisdiction in the Tribunal to deal with suits of liability of an agent alongwith that of Railway Administration.  What is barred by section 15 is trial of a claim by any other Court where that claim is covered by section 13, Section 13 itself cannot cover claim against respondent No.2 and, therefore, bar created by section 15 will not work in a case where there are two defendants.  In our view, such suits are  not barred by section 15."

                "description": "Compensation - Death of passenger in an untoward incident - Deceased falling down from running local train after his head banged on railway post - Deceased having railway season ticket and stood near door of compartment - Incident taken place during evening rush hours - Held, judicial notice has to be taken of the fact that in the City of Mumbai suburban local trains are always overcrowded - Passengers have no option but to stand near doors of compartment as it becomes impossible to force entry inside compartment during rush hours - No case of his negligence made by Railway Authority - This being a case of accidental fall, the claimant would be entitled to compensation.\n\nIn the present case, the deceased was travelling by a suburban local train in the city of Mumbai. The incident occurred at about 18.35 in the evening. A judicial notice has to be taken of the fact that in the city of Mumbai the suburban local trains are always overcrowded. In the present case, the incident has taken place during evening rush hours. It is a fact of life in the city of Mumbai that it is very difficult even to enter the 2nd class compartments of suburban local railway trains at any hour during the course of the day. Especially in morning and evening rush hours the situation is worst and forcing one's entry in a train becomes a daunting task. The situation is not different even on a public holiday. The passengers who normally travel by suburban trains in the city have no choice but to undertake travelling by over-crowded suburban trains only with the object of reaching their respective places of work for earning livelihood. To keep up with the speed with which the city of Mumbai moves, the passengers have no option but to stand near the doors of the compartment as it is impossible to force entry inside the compartments. No purpose is served by waiting for the next train as the situation continues to be the same. There are poles/posts erected by railways near the railway tracks for carrying electric and other cables. A person who stands at the door on the foot board has to survive the enormous pressure exerted by the passengers who are standing inside. There is every possibility that a passenger who is standing at the door may loose his balance due to the pressure of heavy rush. In such a case there is every likelihood that he will be hit by a pole/post standing by the side of Railway track and suffer the inevitable.  However, there may be cases where a passenger is adventurous and though it may be possible to enter the compartment he may choose to hang outside the door on the foot board. When such a person suffers the fate as the deceased in this case has suffered, it is possible to say that he had suffered a self-inflicted injury. But that is not even the case made out by the railway administration in the present case before the Tribunal. No such specific case is made out in written statement. This is a case where the deceased alongwith his wife were travelling by a suburban train to meet their relative at Bhandup. There is more than sufficient evidence on record to show that it was a case of accidental fall from the railway. By no stretch of imagination any negligence can be attributed to the deceased. It does not lie in the mouth of the railway administration to say that as the deceased passenger was standing on the foot board near the door of the compartment, he was negligent. It is an accepted fact in the city of Mumbai that the passengers are forced to stand near the door due to perpetual overcrowding of the suburban trains. There is no option left with the passengers but to do so if they have to reach the place of work in time. \tTherefore, present case will not fall in the category of exception carved out by clause (b) of section 124-A. Court cannot shut eyes to the ground realities of the life in the city of Mumbai.  [Para 10,13]"

If all that is meant to be done by the Commissioner for persons with disabilities under Section 62 of the Act is to correspond or take up the issue with the appropriate authority, i.e. to say, the employer as in this case, then he is an authority with no effective role or purpose. It is difficult to understand in that case the reason for conferring extensive powers of the civil court on the Commissioner for the purposes of discharging his functions under Section 61 and 62 of the said Act. If at the end of the day, all that he is expected to do is to correspond or enquire with the authority, there is no need to confer such elaborate procedural powers on him.

The power may be to \u201ctake up the matter with the appropriate authority\u201d, but then the matter itself must be taken up with a view to redress the grievance and do so effectively.

If, however, after obtaining such disability a person is found to be \u2018not suitable for the post he was holding\u2019, he could be shifted to some other post with the same pay scale and service benefits and if that is not possible, he may be kept on a supernumerary post until a suitable post is available or he attains the age of superannuation, whichever is earlier. That is the mandate of Section 47. There is nothing to suggest that for applying this mandate, the employee must be shown to be a \u2018person with disability\u2019 within the meaning of Section 2(t), that is to say,a person suffering from not less than forty per cent of any disability as certified by a medical authority. In fact, such interpretation would lead to an absurdity. One may in that case actually end up suggesting that an employee can be dispensed with, or reduced in rank, if he suffers from less than forty per cent of any disability, but not if he suffers from forty per cent or more disability. In other words, after acquiring less than forty per cent disability, if an employee is not found suitable for the post he is holding, he can be terminated and need not be shifted to other suitable post, but if he acquires more than forty per cent disability, he must be so shifted and cannot be terminated. That would be a travesty of justice and no sensible legislature could have ever intended such result. (Para 23)"

In formulating the procedures, the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment may lay down appropriate norms to ensure that the condition of the candidate is duly certified by such competent medical authority as may be prescribed so as to ensure that only genuine candidates in need of the facility are able to avail of it. While framing the guidelines, we reiterate at the risk of repetition, that the Union Government should be mindful that the duty to provide reasonable accommodation is an individualized duty as has also been noted by the CRPD Committee in General Comment 6. In other words, a case-by-case approach must be adopted by the relevant body charged with the obligation of providing reasonable accommodation. This requires the relevant body to engage in a dialogue with the individual with disability. While considering the financial cost and resources available for the provision of accommodation, the overall assets rather than just the resources of the concerned unit or department within an organization must be taken into account. It should also be ensured that persons with disability are not required to bear the costs of the accommodation. The consultation with persons with disabilities and their involvement in decision making about matters affecting their lives is necessary to bring about any meaningful change in the realization of their rights. Therefore the said ministry to frame the abovementioned guidelines in consultation with the public, specifically with persons with disabilities and organisations representing them.

                "description": "Civil Services Examination Rules (2018), R.5 - Disabled persons - Providing facility of scribe for writing examination - Concept of reasonable accommodation to be followed - Appellant suffering with disability in form of dysgraphia, commonly known as writers' cramp - Cannot be subjected to further medical examination even though his disability has been accepted - Fact that appellant suffering from specified disability such as chronic neurological condition, making him difficult to write conventional examination - Would entitle him to facility of scribe for writing civil services examination or any other competitive examination - Refusal to provide him such facility, would negate both the constitutional right and its statutory recognition in provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016.\n\n\tThe plea that a whole swath of facilities are provided to the disabled without enquiring into the percentage of their disability and that a percentage is only essential in cases is flawed for two reasons. First, the inarticulate premise underpinning this argument appears to be that the legally guaranteed entitlements of the disabled are privileges doled out by the state and bespeaks an incorrect understanding of the concept of reasonable accommodation. Since reasonable accommodation is a component of the duty not to discriminate against the disabled, as we have explained above, the state is bound to provide these facilities to its disabled citizens. A robust conception of reasonable accommodation needs to be adopted. Second, and relatedly, this being so, it can be no answer to tell a disabled candidate whose disability genuinely necessitates access to a scribe that they are already being given all the above facilities. Providing those facilities does not absolve the state of the obligation to provide a disabled candidate access to a scribe, when this need is clearly established as being relatable to their disability. 2019 ALL SCR 1040 Not foll in view of enactment of 2016 Act. (Paras 42, 56, 57, 58)\n\n\tThe plea that the appellant, suffering disability in form of dyagraphia, commonly known as writer\u2019s cramp must be subjected to further medical examinations, even though his disability has been accepted, is emblematic of a key barrier that often comes in the way of the disabled being able to access reasonable accommodation in India. (Para 60)\n\n\tThere can be no doubt about the fact that the CSE is competitive in itself. There can similarly be no doubt about the need to preserve the purity of the examination. But the apprehension that the facility of a scribe should not be misused can furnish no valid ground to deprive the whole class of citizens - persons with disability who need a scribe - from the statutory entitlements which emanate from the provisions of the enactment, on the supposition that someone may misuse the provisions of the law. Further, undue suspicion about the disabled engaging in wrongdoing is unwarranted. Such a view presumes persons with disabilities, as a class, as incompetent and incapable of success absent access to untoward assistance. The disabled confront stereotypes in several aspects of their day to day lives. One of them is that they do not perform as well as others. Like other stereotypes, this one is also totally flawed and contrary to reality. Such an ableist premise is inconsistent with the approach to disability enshrined in the UNCRPD and the RPwD Act 2016. To think that persons with disabilities who do not have a benchmark disability but nonetheless request access to a scribe, as a class, have the objective of gaming the system is to misunderstand their aspiration, to stamp them with a badge of cheaters and to deprive them of their lawful entitlements. The system may be vulnerable to being gamed by able-bodied persons, however, it is the persons with disabilities who are being asked to bear the cost of maintaining the purity of the competitive examinations by giving up their legal entitlements on the presumption that there is a possibility of misuse. (Paras 62, 63)\n\n\tWhen competent persons with disabilities are unable to realize their full potential due to the barriers posed in their path, our society suffers, as much, if not more, as do the disabled people involved. In their blooming and blossoming, we all bloom and blossom. The most significant loser as a consequence of the UPSC\u2019s rigid approach in this case (of refusing to provide scribes to those not having benchmark disabilities) is the UPSC itself. For it is denying to the nation the opportunity to be served by highly competent people who claim nothing but access to equal opportunity and a barrier-free environment. When an ablebodied student engages in cheating, the normal consequence is their disqualification or other suitable punitive action. The same consequence can flow from a candidate using their disability to game the system. If some incidents come to light of able-bodied candidates hiding chits in their dress code and misusing them to cheat in an exam, the normal consequence is suitable punitive action against such students. It is not to switch to a different dress code that is so uncomfortable that many competent students find it hard to sit in it for the entire duration of the exam and perform to the best of their ability. In the same way, just because of the fault of some bad apples in the system, persons with disabilities whose disability necessitates access to a scribe cannot be disentitled from claiming the same. (Paras 64, 65)\n\n\tTherefore the possibility of misuse cannot be used to deprive equal access to persons with disability from seeking the facility of a scribe. Absent such a facility, persons such as the appellant in serviced who suffers from a chronic neurological condition would be deprived of a statutory right of equal opportunity in gaining an appointment to public services. To do so would negate both the constitutional right and its statutory recognition in the provisions of the RPwD Act, 2016. (Para 66)\n\n\tThe condition appellant has been repeatedly affirmed by several medical authorities including National Institute of Mental Health and Neuro Sciences (NIMHANS), Bangalore and AIIMS. The AIIMS report which was pursuant to the order of this Court is clear in opining that the appellant has a specified disability inasmuch as he has a chronic neurological condition. This condition Forms part of Entry IV of the Schedule to the RPwD Act 2016. The writer\u2019s cramp has been found successively to be a condition which the appellant has, making it difficult for him to write a conventional examination. To deny the facility of a scribe in a situation such as the present would negate the valuable rights and entitlements which are recognised by the RPwD Act 2016. There the appellant would be entitled to the facility of a scribe for appearing at the Civil Services Examination and any other competitive selection conducted under the authority of the government.
