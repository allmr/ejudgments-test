DRT dismissed application.  Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT) dismissed the appeal.  High Court upheld order of DRAT.  In further appeal Supreme Court considered whether respondents 1 and 2 are 'financial institutions' within the meaning of DRT Act.  Supreme Court observed that section 4-A of the Companies Act provides that each of the financial institutions specified in sub-section (1) shall be regarded for the purpose of that Act, as a public financial institution.  The financial institutions specified included the 'Unit Trust of India' established under Section 3 of the UTI Act, 1963.  By operation of Section 18 of the UTI Act, 2002, 'Unit Trust of India' is substituted by the 'Specified Company' or 'Administrator of the Specified Undertaking', as the case may be.  Thus, the 'Specified Company' and the 'Administrator of the Specified Undertaking' must be deemed to be financial institutions specified in sub-section (1) of Section 4-A of the Companies Act.  Section 2(h) of the DRT Act defines a 'financial institution' to mean a public financial institution within the meaning of Section 4-A of the Companies Act.  Consequently by reason of deemed amendment of Section 4-A of the Companies Act, the 'Specified Company' and the 'Administrator of the Specified Undertaking' come within the definition of financial institutions as defined under Section 2(h) of DRT Act.  Court did not find that the use of words 'as the case may be' introduces any element of uncertainty.  [Para 27,28,29]"

Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT) dismissed appeal.  High Court upheld order of DRAT.  In further appeal Supreme Court considered whether the action before DRT is for recovery of debts due to them from appellant herein, and not due to any other person on whose behalf aforesaid respondents are suing.  Supreme Court observed that in place of Unit Trust of India both the respondents stand substituted.  Both are entitled to sue as financial institutions and question whether they have an enforceable claim must be decided in the facts and circumstances of each case.  There is no uncertainty because the assets possessed by these two identities are clearly enumerated in Schedules I and II of the Unit Trust of India (Transfer of Undertaking and Repeal) Act, 2002.  The erstwhile Unit Trust of India ceased to exist and in its place a specified company and an Administrator of the specified undertaking of the Trust came into existence.  The transfer and vesting of assets, rights etc. in these two bodies is in the widest possible terms as per section 5 of the Unit Trust of India (Transfer of Undertaking and Repeal) Act, 2002.  The transfer and vesting is complete.  The fact that the management is carried on by the Administrator of the specified undertaking on behalf of Central Government which is authorized to issue directions to the Administrator does not detract from the fact that the 'specified undertaking' vests in the Administrator.  Section 5 of the Act leaves no doubt that vesting in the Administrator or in the Specified Company is complete.  The powers vested in the Administrator under Section 10 of the Act cover almost every power of management and administration.  Section 10(1)(b) in particular authorizes him on the advice of the Board of Advisors to invest, acquire, hold or dispose of securities and to exercise and enforce all powers and rights incidental thereto including protection or realization of such investment etc.  Thus, it is a part of the power of management vested in the Administrator to invest as well as to realize such investments.  Apparently therefore, if any amount is owing to the specified undertaking, the Administrator has the authority to take all necessary steps to realize any amount due to the specified undertaking.  The statute vests this power in him.  It cannot therefore be assumed that he does not possess power to make recoveries in course of management.  The mere fact that Central Government may give him directions or he may seek instructions from Central Government does not mean that the power exercised by the Administrator are not the powers vested in him by law.  Subject to such directions as may be given by Central Government, it is the Administrator who must exercise his power of management and administration.  Apparently therefore in recovering dues owing to the specified undertaking, the Administrator exercises the powers vested in him under the Act in his own right since the undertaking vests in him, and the Act vests in him wide powers of management and administration which include the power to recover dues owing to the specified undertaking.  It is, therefore, futile to contend that the Administrator acts as an agent of the Central Government.  He acts in exercise of the powers vested in him by the statute and in the manner prescribed by the statute.  Even assuming that the Administrator manages the specified undertaking on behalf of Central Government, that will not make any difference.  The amounts sought to be recovered are allegedly owing to the Specified Company and the Administrator, who are 'financial institutions' within the meaning of DRT Act, 1993.  Thus, they are not seeking to recover any dues owing to Central Government, and therefore, they cannot be held to be acting on behalf of Central Government.  In their own right they are seeking to recover amounts due to them in exercise of status and power conferred upon them by statute.  So viewed, nature of control of Central Government over them is wholly irrelevant in considering question of jurisdiction of DRT to entertain such a claim.  There is nothing in the Act which may justify the submission that the specified company acts as a trustee.  It manages and executes the schemes contained in Schedule I of the Act in accordance with the provisions of the Act.  The Administrator and the Specified Company were therefore, fully authorized in law to recover dues from appellants as 'financial institutions' and DRT had undoubted jurisdiction to entertain their claims.  Appeal dismissed.  [Para 30,37,39]"

Clause (2) of Regulation 13 provides that officer employee shall not ordinarily remain absent in case of sickness or accident without submitting a proper medical certificate.  However, in the case of temporary indisposition or a sickness of a casual nature, it is open to the Competent Authority to dispense with the production of a medical certificate.  Regulation 13 cannot be read to mean that the Bank is bound by the medical certificate produced by the officer employee justifying his absence from duties.  The Bank can, in the circumstances, discard the medical certificate produced by the officer employee for remaining absent.  It can refuse to accept medical certificate produced by the officer employee if it finds that this is only device for remaining absent.

This is the mainstay and centerpiece of his work and faith reposed on him by the employer. The Labour Court as well as the High Court has been guided by the perception that there was no recovery of money and, therefore, there was no corruption or embezzlement. But it fails to notice the nature of duties and obligation of a conductor. Even the finding on no corruption or embezzlement is ambiguous and contradictory. The loss caused to the Corporation cannot be marginalized. In such a situation the question of reformation and to make him disciplined or giving him another chance, does not arise. The Conductor holds the post of trust under the Corporation. It is extremely difficult on the part of the checking authorities to check in a constant manner. An employee holding the post that requires trust and confidence is expected to behave with discipline, loyalty and also maintain the fiscal sanctity. He should not allow anything to creep in which would make him a person of questionable integrity. The Labour Court and High Court remained wholly oblivious remained wholly oblivious to the facts that conductor had allowed 25 passengers to travel without ticket; that by virtue of the said act, the Corporation had sustained loss; that he had mischievously lodged an FIR at the police station regarding misplacing of waybill by him; that his conduct manifestly shows his involvement for personal gain, and that the eventual act was to conceal the corruption which was rooted in his personal gain. The finding recorded by the Labour Court on this score is absolutely perverse and the High Court has repeated the reasons and concurred with the conclusion. Thus, the irresistible conclusion has to be that the charge pertaining to personal gain has been proved. It can be stated that the contrary conclusion would tantamount to ignoring the obvious and, in a way, treating the pinchbeck to be real. Though there is concurrent finding of fact, but the approach being manifestly perverse, the same can be interfered with in exercise of power under Article 136 of the Constitution. They have fallen in error by imposing a lesser punishment on respondent-workman whereas the only punishment, on establishment of the charges which have been accepted by the labour court, should have been dismissal and not a lesser one. \n\nIn the case at hand, the delinquent employee has harboured the notion that when the cancerous growth has affected the system, he can further allow it to grow by covering it like an octopus, with its tentacles disallowing any kind of surgical operation or treatment so that the lesion continues. The whole act is reprehensible and such a situation does not even remotely commend any lenience.\n\n(2001) 5 SCC 755, 2013 ALL SCR 1533 Rel.on.  [Para 5,10,12,13,15]"

Constitution of India, Art.226.\n\nThe University in the present case cannot be faulted in issuing the impugned circular dated 14th March, 2005.  The Commission has serious concerns about the manner in which colleges and institutions were appointing lecturers, who did not meet the required qualifications and were then moving the UGC for post facto exemptions from the requirement of passing the NET examination. The University on its part has in the present case made out valid grounds for its concern that private managements are resorting to the unhealthy practice of making appointments through local selection committees so as to obviate the need for a wide publication of advertisements that would generate the best possible response. The Statutes of the University make detailed provision for the appointment of teachers through University Selection Committees. Local selection committees are contemplated where temporary appointments are made. Despite this, year after year, the experience of the University has shown that managements continue to appoint teachers without issuing advertisements approved by the University to the detriment of the interest of the community of students and the cause of education. The decision of the University, which is an expert academic body is entitled to deference. The Court will not interfere in an academic matter, particularly in the absence of arbitrariness or malafides.  1994 Suppl.(3) SCC 516 - Referred to.  [Para 10]"

                "description": "Expression \"in consultation with the universities or other bodies concerned\" - \"Other bodies\" does not include State Disaster Management Authority or health experts - UGC is not obliged to consult all Universities or States before issuance of guidelines which is general in nature. \n\nThe expression \u2018other bodies\u2019 used in the opening part of the Section is in reference to other bodies apart from universities enumerated in Section 12. The submission that \u2018other bodies\u2019 as used in Section 12 should include State Disaster Management Authority or health experts is misconceived. Section 12 never contemplated any such \u201cbodies\u201d. Furthermore, the State Disaster Management Authority came into existence only after enactment of Disaster Management Act, 2005, no such concept was there when the UGC Act, 1956 was enacted. The expression \u2018other bodies\u2019 cannot be expanded as contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner. The use of the word \u2018concerned\u2019 after \u2018Universities or other bodies\u2019 has specific purpose and meaning. The consultation with the Universities or other bodies concerned was in reference to a particular function which was enumerated in clause (a) to (j) and it has specific reference and \u201cUniversities\u201d or other bodies\u201d were referred to in the above context. Section 12 cannot be interpreted in a manner that for taking any measure with regard to coordination of university education and for determination and maintenance of standards of teaching examination in the Universities, the UGC should consult each and every University of each and every State and only then, such measures can be taken. Reading the provision in above manner shall make the functioning of UGC unworkable. There are more than nine hundred Universities in the country and to require UGC to consult more than nine hundred universities for taking any measure will make the functioning impossible and impractical.\n\nSection 12 cannot be interpreted in a manner that for taking any steps by the UGC, there is a mandatory requirement of consultation of all the States/Universities failing which no measures can be taken by the University Grants Commission. Clause (j) of Section 12 is couched in a very vide manner which empower the commission to perform such other functions as may be prescribed or as may be deemed necessary by the Commission for advancing the cause of higher education in India or as may be incidental or conducive to the discharge of the above function. Any function which may be deemed necessary by the Commission can be performed. For performance of its function by the Commission, the Commission of its own is fully competent to take decisions, issue any directions, guidelines, etc. The Commission may also take assistance of any Committee of experts in discharge of its functions for which there is no prohibition in the statutory scheme.(Paras 86, 87, 88, 110)\n\nThe expression \u201cin consultation with the Universities or other bodies concerned\u201d has to be read to mean where consultation with Universities or other bodies concerned is necessary without which the Commission is unable to perform its functions. \n\nWhether for collecting information relating to University education in India, UGC has to consult all 900 or more Universities and whether without consultation with the Universities, it cannot perform its functions under Section 12(h), the answer would be obviously that it is not necessary for UGC to consult all the universities while collecting information relating to University Education in India. The expression \u201cUniversities or other bodies concerned\u201d has not be read in a rigid manner rather it is flexible as per requirement of the Commission. The residuary clause i.e. Section 12(j) cloth the Commission to perform such other functions as may be deemed necessary by the Commission. The guidelines dated 29.04.2020 and 06.07.2020 have been issued after consultation of an expert Committee. The guidelines have been issued after a report of an expert committee consisting of academicians and experts. It cannot be said that the Commission had no jurisdiction to issue guidelines without consulting all the Universities in the Country and all the States or Union Territories.(Paras 90, 92)\n\nThe UGC is empowered to perform such other functions as may be deemed necessary by the Commission. If the Commission felt it necessary to issue guidelines after obtaining a report from the expert committee, no exception can be taken to the procedure adopted by the Commission. The guidelines dated 29.04.2020 as well as revised guidelines dated 06.07.2020 are general in nature and not confined to any particular university or any particular state. Hence, it cannot be said that UGC is obliged to consult all Universities or States before issuance of the guidelines.(Para 93)"

When the State Disaster Management Authority and State Government take a decision that for mitigation or prevention of disaster it is not possible to hold physical examination in the State, the said decision was within the four corners of Disaster Management Act, 2005. However, the decision of the Disaster Management Authority or the State Government that students should be promoted without appearing in the final year/terminal semester examination, is not within the domain of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The decision to promote students and grant Degree by a State if contrary to any Central enactment or guidelines issued thereunder the Central enactment and the guidelines thereunder shall have precedence by virtue of the same being referable to Entry 66 List I. Thus, Court conclude that the State Disaster Management Authority and the State Government has no jurisdiction to take a decision that the students of final year/terminal examination should be promoted on the basis of earlier years assessment and internal assessment whereas the UGC guidelines dated 06.07.2020 directed specifically to conduct final year/terminal semester examination. The UGC guidelines dated 06.07.2020 in the above respect shall override the decision of the State Government and the State Disaster Management Authority regarding promoting the students, does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and shall have no protection of Section 72 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. We, thus, conclude that the State or the State Disaster Management Authority have no jurisdiction under Disaster Management Act, 2005 to take a decision for promoting the students on the basis of previous performance or internal assessment which decision being contrary to revised guidelines of the University Grants Commission cannot be upheld and has to give way to the guidelines of UGC which is the Authority to issue guidelines for determination and maintenance of standards of education and teaching of the Universities.(Paras 109, 110, 111)\n\nIf any State/Union Territory in exercise of jurisdiction under Disaster Management Act, 2005 has taken a decision that it is not possible to conduct the final year/terminal semester examination by 30.09.2020, the liberty granted to such State/Union Territory to make an application to the University Grants Commission for extending deadline of 30.09.2020 for that State/Union Territory which shall be considered by UGC and rescheduled date be communicated to such State/Union Territory at the earliest.(Para 111)"

The non-compliance thereof can be excused only by the UGC. If any University or the College affiliated to the University fails to comply with the norms specified in the UGC Regulations without a good cause, the consequence would be that of depriving it of the grants from the UGC.\n\n(2009) 4 SCC 590 Rel. on.  [Para 24]\n\nIn view of the above, it is too late in the day to contend that it was open to the Pune University to ignore the guidelines specified by UGC in relation to the qualifications of teachers/principal. The fact that the said qualifications are not expressly provided for in the State Universities Act or the Statutes, and Regulations framed thereunder would not absolve the University from abiding by the qualifications so prescribed by UGC.  [Para 26]\n\nTo put it differently, it would not be open to the Pune University nor the respondent College, which is affiliated to the Pune University, to make appointment on the post of Principal of the respondent College in disregard of the minimum qualification prescribed in the UGC Regulations which have the force of law. If the said respondents were to do so, would run the risk of denial of the grants by the UGC. The UGC Regulations, therefore, for that limited purpose, cannot be disregarded by the State University established under the State Act as well as the College affiliated thereto, though the same has been held as recommendatory by the Apex Court.\n\n1994 Supp.(3) SCC 516 and (2009) 4 SCC 590 Ref. to.  [Para 27]\n\nBy virtue of Ordinance of Pune University No. O.165 the qualification specified by UGC will be deemed to have been incorporated in the said Ordinance of the Pune University. Even for that reason, the Pune University as well as the respondent College were obliged to ensure that the appointment to the post of the Principal of the respondent College must be made from amongst the candidate possessing minimum qualification specified in the UGC Regulations of 2000. This obligation is dehors the direction issued by the State Government in the impugned GR, directing the University to adopt the norms specified by the UGC Regulations. A priori, the norms specified in the UGC Regulations regarding minimum qualification of the candidate to be appointed on the post of Principal ought to be construed as the law governing the field.

High Court also rightly noticed that such a plea could not be raised in a proceeding under Section 18.  Special Land Acquisition Officer offered compensation to the claimants obviously on basis that State recognized claimants as owners of lands which were sought to be acquired.  Having done so and having made a reference to Court u/s.18, it could not be contended in proceedings u/s.18 or in any proceedings arising therefrom that claimants, to whom compensation was offered were not owners of lands.

Thereafter, the competent authority issued Notification under Section 10(3) of the Act which was published in the Gazette of the State declaring that the land of plot nos. 1 to 16 deemed to have been acquired by the State.

Thereafter, the competent authority gets power to make order directing the person who is in possession of the land to surrender or deliver the possession of the land to the State Government, and if that person does not deliver the possession then the Competent authority becomes competent to take possession under sub-section (6) of Section 10 of the Principal Act. Thus, after 29.11.2007, the provisions of sub-section (5) and sub-section (6) of Section 10 of the Principal Act are not available to the State Government, therefore, in relation to that land with respect to which declaration under sub-section (3) of Section 10 of the Principal Act has been made but possession has not been taken, the Competent authority will not be entitled to make an order directing the person in possession of the land to deliver the possession to the Government nor the Competent authority would be entitled to take possession under sub-section (6) of Section 10 of the Principal Act on failure of the person in possession to deliver the possession. Thus, the State Government will not be in a position to take possession of the land under the provisions of the Principal Act, it will also not be in a position to determine the compensation of the land under Section 11 of the Principal Act and make payment of that compensation to the interested persons under Section 14 of the Principal Act. Section 4 of the Repeal Act keeps the provisions of Sections 11, 12, 13 and 14 relating to determination of amount and payment of amount alive only in relation to the land possession of which has been taken by the Government. Therefore, it is clear from the provisions of the Repeal Act that as a result of the Repeal Act neither any proceedings can continue nor the State Government can claim that the land continued to vest in it if possession of the land in relation to which declaration under sub-section (3) of Section 10 of the Principal Act has been made, has not been taken before 29.11.2007. In other words to claim that vesting of the land in the State Government is saved, it will have to be shown by the State Government that the possession of the land in accordance with the provisions of the Principal Act has been taken by the Government before 29.11.2007. \t\t\t\t      [Para 11,14,15]"

All that is not saved in Section 3 should get abated by virtue of operation of Section 4. The submission made by petitioners that the proviso to Section 4 will have application as possession was admittedly not taken is not tenable. The reason is that Section 3(1)(b) in terms protects any scheme sanctioned or order passed on the application under Section 20 of the Act of 1976 granting exemption before the commencement of the Urban Land (Ceiling And Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999. That being so, in the instant case the exemption order was passed by Hon'ble Chief Minister on 23/11/2007 and the said order remained as it is. However, after repeal in the State of Maharashtra w.e.f. 01/12/2007, the validity of that order cannot be challenged due to the bar of Section 3(1)(b) of the Urban Land (Ceiling And Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 providing for 'Saving'. The reason appears to be the consideration of providing for the need of the beneficiaries for whom schemes were sanctioned under Section 20 of the Act of 1976 by exemption before the repeal.\n\nSection 20 of the Act of 1976 has not been inserted in the proviso to Section 4 of Urban Land (Ceiling And Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999, in order that schemes sanctioned and the orders of exemption made under Section 20 of the Act of 1976 are saved.\n\n2009 ALL SCR (O.C.C.) 10 Ref. to.\t    [Para 12]"

Dharmadhikari and G.S. Kulkarni, JJ. (Majority):- \n\nThough it would be open for the State to enforce the exemption order and terms and conditions thereof, validity of which is saved by the Repeal Act, but having regard to the language of Section 20(2) of the Principal Act it cannot be held that same can be enforced only by withdrawal of the order of exemption in terms of sub-section (2) of Section 20, which power also survives the repeal of the Principal Act. In other words, though Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act read with Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 states that repeal of the Principal Act shall not affect the validity of the exemption order passed under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act or any action taken thereunder notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the contrary, still the obligations and liabilities incurred voluntarily under the exemption order by the person holding the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit need not be enforced only by exercise of powers under sub-section (2) of Section 20 of the Principal Act, but by all other legally per-missible means.\n\nWhether any of these powers could be exercised and to what extent are all matters which must be decided in the facts and circumstances of each case. In the event the State desires to take any action in terms of Section 20(2) of the Principal Act it would be open for the aggrieved parties to urge that such an action is not permissible in the given facts and circumstances particularly because of enormous and unexplained delay, the parties having altered their position to their detriment, the proceedings as also the orders in that behalf are grossly unfair, unjust, arbitrary, high handed, malafide and violative of the principles of natural justice and of the Constitutional mandate enshrined in Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 21 and 300A of the Constitution of India.\n\nIn the light of the wording of Section 20(2) of the Principal Act the State is competent to withdraw, but only after giving a reasonable opportunity to the persons concerned for making representation against the proposed withdrawal. The Government is obliged to pass an order withdrawing any exemption and needless to clarify that in the event such an order is passed it can be impugned and challenged by the aggrieved parties in appropriate proceedings on the grounds that it is unreasoned and/or in the given facts and circumstances such an order could not have been passed or need not be passed and the Government could have granted time to comply with the terms and conditions or that the terms and conditions relying on which and for breach of which the exemption order is withdrawn are not violated or breached, they were not mandatory and have been substantially complied with or were incapable of being complied with because of several factors, obstacles and hurdles each of which cannot be enumerated or termed as exhaustive in any manner. Therefore, if the Government is not mandated to withdraw the exemption order, but can ensure compliance of the terms and conditions without withdrawal of the exemption order or without recourse to Section 20(2) of the Principal Act, then, needless to clarify that all liabilities, obligations and equally the remedies available to the parties are unaffected by repeal and can be resorted to in the afore stated events. [Para 135]\n\nPer S.C. Gupte, J. (Contra):-\n\nThere is no question of enforcement of the order of exemption under Section 20(1) or its terms and conditions, in accordance with the provisions of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976. Neither can the exemption granted under Section 20(1) of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 be withdrawn for breach of conditions under Section 20(2) nor can Chapter III be applied to the land exempted under Section 20(1) after withdrawal of the exemption under Section 20(2) of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976.\n\nThe order of exemption can be implemented or enforced in any manner acceptable to law, if, and to the extent, such order could be implemented or enforced otherwise than by recourse to the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976. The State may enforce the order together with its conditions through a Court of law or devise any legislative or executive means to implement the order of exemption and its conditions. The enforceability of the order, and legality of the measure adopted for its implementation will, however, have to be decided in the facts and circumstances of each individual case.\n\nThe State cannot recall/cancel/modify any exemption order granted under Section 20 of the Principal Act at any time after the coming into force of the Repeal Act.

Dharmadhikari and G.S. Kulkarni, JJ. (Majority):-\n\nThe Legislature was aware that not only the terms and conditions of the exemption order need to be enforced, but if that order is acted upon by parties the validity as a whole must be saved. That needs to be saved so as to enable the State Government to apply the provisions of Chapter-III to the excess vacant land covered by the exemption order and the terms and conditions after it is noticed that the exemption is either misused or misutilized or not acted upon so as to subserve the larger public interest. A breach or violation of some of its vital conditions may result in its withdrawal and cancellation. If one way of applying Chapter-III is by withdrawing the exemption order, then, the power to withdraw the same which is implicit and inherent in the power to grant exemption is also saved and not affected by repeal of the Principal Act. Therefore, once the power of exemption can be exercised after the excess vacant land has vested in the State, then, equally the power to withdraw the exemption can also be exercised in case of such vacant land.\n\nAbsence of sub-section (2) of Section 20 of the Principal Act in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act would that the power to withdraw the exemption is not saved. It is possible that the power to withdraw the exemption may not be exercised in every case. However, when the State exercises the power to exempt the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit and which has already vested in it, then, there is no impediment in withdrawing the exemption from applicability of Chapter-III of the Principal Act in the case of such lands.     [Para 63]\n\nThe repeal of the Principal Act shall not affect the validity of the order of exemption under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act and all consequences following the same including keeping intact the power to withdraw the said exemption by recourse to Section 20(2) of the Principal Act. Further, merely because Section 20(2) is not specifically mentioned in the saving clause enacted by Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act that does not mean that the power is not saved. The said power is also saved by virtue of applicability of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. That Section of the General Clauses Act, 1897 applies to Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act.\n\n(b) Once having held that the power to withdraw the exemption also survives the repeal of the Principal Act, then, all consequences must follow and the said power can be exercised by the State Government in accordance with law.\n\nThat power and equally all ancillary and incidental powers to the main power to impose conditions are also saved and survive the repeal. Meaning thereby the terms and conditions of the order of exemption can be enforced in accordance with law.\n\n2000 (123) ELT 3 (SC) Disting.\n\nW.P. 26474/2009 (A.P.), W.P.

(Contra) :-\n\nThe exemption order, as rightly noted by brother Dharmadhikari J, grants a privilege, but such privilege is granted on certain conditions. The entire exemption order would be valid, that is to say, both the privilege and the conditions would be valid. In the absence of any valid reasons, it cannot possibly be suggested that only the privilege is valid and not the conditions on which it is granted.\n\nNow the question is, what are the consequences of such validity. The obvious consequences, which are provided in the Repeal Act itself, are (a) all actions taken under the exemption order are valid and (b) payment made thereunder to the State Government is valid. But what are the other consequences. Could it be that the breach of the conditions of a valid exemption order would attract the provisions of Section 20(2) and all provisions of Chapter III including those relating to vesting of the land would thereupon apply to such land (i.e. land becoming excess vacant land as a result of withdrawal of exemption under Section 20(2)).\n\nThere are clear indications in the Repeal Act that these consequences are not contemplated. In the first place, withdrawal of an exemption order renders the land 'excess vacant land' just as any other vacant land which is in excess of the ceiling limit and which is not subject to an exemption order under Section 20(1). If such other vacant land could not continue to be vested in the State Government even after the provisions of Section 10(3) applied to it, if possession of the land was not already taken by the Government on the date of the repeal, there is no reason why the provisions of Section 20(2) and consequences of withdrawal of exemption thereunder should apply to a land which is exempted under Section 20(1), but conditions of such exemption are breached as on, or after, the date of the repeal.\n\nNeither the savings clause of the Repeal Act nor Section 6 of the General Clauses Act saves the provisions of Section 20(2) or the applicability of Chapter III of the Principal Act in relation to an exemption order passed under Section 20(1). If the conditions of exemption granted under Section 20(1) are breached, neither can the exemption be withdrawn after the repeal nor could Chapter III be applied to the land upon withdrawal of such exemption after the repeal. There is no question of the State Government seeking to acquire such land any time after the repeal.\n\nWhat is saved by the saving clause of the repealing statute is the validity of an exemption order, and it means the validity of both the exemption and the conditions on which it is granted. But that does not mean that the breach of any condition of the exemption order can be visited with the consequence of either withdrawal of exemption under Section 20(2) or application of Chapter III of the Principal Act to the land. At the same time, if it were permissible to implement or enforce the exemption order in any manner acceptable to law otherwise than by recourse to Section 20(2) or Chapter III of the Principal Act, such implementation or enforcement is permissible even after the repeal.

Dharmadhikari and G.S. Kulkarni, JJ. (Majority) :-\n\nA perusal of the judgment in Bansidhar's Case [(1989) 2 SCC 557] and effect of repeal enacted by Section 6 of the General Clauses Act would show that a saving provision in the repealing statute is not exhaustive of the rights and obligations so saved or the rights that survive the repeal. The line of inquiry as has been repeatedly pointed out by the Honourable Supreme Court would be not whether the new Act expressly keeps alive the old rights and liabilities, but whether it manifests an intention to destroy them. Unless such an intention is manifested by the new Act, the rights and liabilities under the repealed Act will continue to exist by force of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. It is the repealing Act and not the Act repealed which is to manifest the contrary intention so as to exclude the operation of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. The silence of the repealing Act is consistent and not inconsistent with Section 6 applying. That is how we are of the opinion that if this line of inquiry is carried forward it would show that the Repeal Act did not manifest an intention contrary to Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. The nature of right that is claimed or in other words the privilege under exemption order is not absolute. The Honourable Supreme Court holds that the scheme of the Act seems to be to determine the ceiling area of each person with reference to the appointed day. Hence, the rights and obligations under the provision had to be determined with reference to the notified date. If that is so and in this case if the lands are in excess of ceiling limit and some of them may have vested in the State already, then, the exemption claimed from applicability of Chapter-III would not mean that the character of the lands is in any way altered or their status is changed. The date with reference to which the lands have become excess, thus cannot be ignored while determining the nature of the rights and privilege. All the more if such privilege or right is conditional as noted above. In these circumstances we see no reason to deviate from the principles in the case of Bansidhar (supra).\n\nWe are of the clear opinion that clauses (b) and (c) of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act are thus, clearly attracted. Therefore, the repeal will not affect the previous operation of the Principal Act or anything duly done or suffered thereunder.\n\nIf an intention was to the contrary then, there was no need for the Parliament to have save the validity of any exemption order under sub-section (1) of Section 20 of the Principal Act or any action taken thereunder and declare the same to be not affected by repeal of the Principal Act notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the contrary. There may have been cases before repeal of the Principal Act in which there was challenge to the exemption orders or to the conditions thereunder. Some of these challenges may have succeeded. The validity of the exemption order may have been put in issue and even such pronouncements of the court may affect the order granting exemption or any action taken thereunder. Now, because of Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act, it is apparent that the order or condition or action is not invalid. It is declared to be valid by the Repeal Act and, therefore, the repeal of the Principal Act was not to affect the validity of such an order. In other words during subsistence of the Principal Act and when it was in force the exemption order or condition thereunder or any action taken thereunder may have been declared invalid by a court of law. Now, notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the contrary the validity of exemption order is saved. That is saved expressly so as to not take away its legal effects. The intent is not to affect adversely the legal consequences flowing from such valid order. Hence, far from manifesting or demonstrating a contrary intention, Section 3 of the Repeal Act is consistent and in consonance with the applicability of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act. In these circumstances we are of the view that the principle laid down in the afore noted cases including Bansidhar (supra) would squarely apply.\n\n(1989) 2 SCC 557 Rel.on.\n\n2009(4) ALL MR 51 Held not good law.     [Para 55,73,79,80,91]\n\nPer. S.C. Gupte, J. (Contra) :-\n\nFrom the Provisions of Repeal Act it is clear that apart from saving the validity of an exemption order under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act, the scheme of the Repeal Act is that every consequence of a person holding excess land under the Principal Act is done away with except in these cases:\n\n(i) Where the land is not only vested in, but taken possession of by, the State Government under the Principal Act;\n\n(ii) Where the land is vested, though possession is not taken, but payment is made by the State Government in respect of such land;\n\n(iii) Where there is a payment made to the State Government or an action taken under an exemption order under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act.\n\nThese provisions are clear and loud. They imply a complete repeal or obliteration of the law except in cases particularly provided for. But if and to the extent there is any ambiguity (thereby permitting external aids for interpretation of the repealing statute), we may have reference to the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the repealing statute. The Objects and Reasons acknowledge a near unanimous public opinion that the Act has failed to achieve its objectives as expected. In these premises, the Repeal Act proposes a complete repeal without any reservation, saving only the consequences specially provided for.\n\nThe repealing statute in our case, as noted above, exhibits a contrary intention to not to save anything which is not expressly saved by the saving clauses contained in Sections 3 and 4 thereof.\n\nEven otherwise, assuming that Clauses (a) to (e) of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act were to apply to acts, or rights and liabilities, or proceedings under the Principal Act after the repeal, it is difficult to see how the exemption order can be withdrawn or provisions of Chapter III can be applied to such land upon withdrawal of exemption. The argument of the State is that by virtue of Clause (c) of Section 6, rights, privileges, obligations or liabilities under the repealed Principal Act, are saved. Clause (c) talks about any right, privilege, obligation or liability \"acquired, accrued or incurred\" under the repealed enactment. Mere existence of a right, which has not been \"acquired\" or \"accrued\" on the date of the repeal, would not get protection under Clause (c) of Section 6. So also a liability cannot be enforced under the provisions of the repealed statute unless the same is \"incurred\".   [Para 158,159,168,169]"

If the contention of the State referred to above is to be accepted, then the peculiar position will be as follows. As stated by us, before the excess is determined, a person will not be able to seek exemption because he does not know what is the actual excess land held and once the excess is determined, he cannot apply because he is not holding the excess land. Thus, the entire object of S.20 will be frustrated.

If the State was aggrieved by an order of competent authority under section 10, it can go in appeal and for some reason it fails to go in appeal it may under section 34 revise that order.  In such a situation it would be unreasonable to interpret that section 33 prescribed the limitation of 30 days and no limitation is prescribed by section 34.  The reason for not prescribing any limitation under section 34 is clear and simple.  It is to avoid miscarriage of justice either to an individual or to the State by the lapse committed by the competent authority.  Consequently this power of correcting illegalities has to be exercised within reasonable time.  As aforesaid the period of three years from the date of order can be always termed as reasonable.  [Para 14]\n\nUnder the Urban Land Ceiling Act, we are dealing with urban land.  The purpose of acquiring land is to provide the same for creating residential accommodation.  Scheme can be made under the Act for housing for which exemption under section 20 is also available.  The whole purpose of the Act being making the provisions of Urban Land for creating accommodation to hold that the revisional powers can be exercised at any point of time would be defeating the very purpose for which the Act is enacted.  To illustrate we will assume that declaration of surplus under section 10 has taken place in January 1995.  Possession is taken in 1996 and distribution is completed in 1998.  The land is allotted to a co-operative housing society and by 2000 co-operative housing society erected 10 tenements in that land in which 100 families are housing.  In 2002 i.e. 7 years after the declaration has taken place if the State Government is to exercise the revisional powers in such situation, it would be divesting those 100 tenements holders, it will be affecting co-operative societies and that would be caused without there being any fault on the part of either of the society or of tenement holders.  Such harsh consequence of the Legislation are not contemplated.  In any event therefore the revisional power under section 34 cannot be exercised in cases where after valid determination of surplus declaration proceeding and after vesting of the land in the State and consequent allotment thereof in accordance with the law, the powers of revision cannot be exercised whatever be the period of limitation.  In the present case the land also vested in the p,etitioner before the proceedings were taken up and consequently the power under section 34 could not be exercised after 17 years of declaration.  Viewed from any corner therefore the exercise of power by Minister under section 34 is unsustainable in law, and is therefore liable to be quashed.  [Para 17]"

Act specifically emphasizes upon weaker section of the people.  The expression \"weaker section\" also finds place in Art.46 of the Constitution.  However, that expression has not been defined either in the Constitution or in the Act itself.  Both, Art.46 and Sec. 21, intended that all the citizens of India belonging to the weaker sections, including the members of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, should have the benefit.  Since in recent years the value of urban land has gone up sky high, it has become impossible for any member of the weaker sections to have residential accommodation anywhere and much less in urban areas.  Since a reasonable residence is an indispensable necessity for fulfilling the constitutional goal in the matter of development of a man and should be taken as included in 'life' in Art.21, greater social control is called for and exemptions granted under Sections 20 and 21 should have to be appropriately monitored to have the fullest benefit of the beneficial legislation.  The aim and object of the provision is to reserve particular quota for the weaker section of the community in the dwelling houses, and therefore the practice of the Government authorities to allot such tenements to the persons who are working as District Judge or a sitting M.L.A. is nothing but mockery of this Rule and has to be deprecated.

In such circumstances, order passed under Section 34 of the U.L.C. Act can be sustained even after extra-ordinary delay. (1969)2 SCC 187, (2007)8 SCC 305 and 2007 ALL SCR 2767 - Ref. to.  [Para 15]"

Thereafter, the competent authority gets power to make order directing the person who is in possession of the land to surrender or deliver the possession of the land to the State Government, and if that person does not deliver the possession then the Competent authority becomes competent to take possession under sub-section (6) of Section 10 of the Principal Act. Thus, after 29.11.2007, the provisions of sub-section (5) and sub-section (6) of Section 10 of the Principal Act are not available to the State Government, therefore, in relation to that land with respect to which declaration under sub-section (3) of Section 10 of the Principal Act has been made but possession has not been taken, the Competent authority will not be entitled to make an order directing the person in possession of the land to deliver the possession to the Government nor the Competent authority would be entitled to take possession under sub-section (6) of Section 10 of the Principal Act on failure of the person in possession to deliver the possession. Thus, the State Government will not be in a position to take possession of the land under the provisions of the Principal Act, it will also not be in a position to determine the compensation of the land under Section 11 of the Principal Act and make payment of that compensation to the interested persons under Section 14 of the Principal Act. Section 4 of the Repeal Act keeps the provisions of Sections 11, 12, 13 and 14 relating to determination of amount and payment of amount alive only in relation to the land possession of which has been taken by the Government. Therefore, it is clear from the provisions of the Repeal Act that as a result of the Repeal Act neither any proceedings can continue nor the State Government can claim that the land continued to vest in it if possession of the land in relation to which declaration under sub-section (3) of Section 10 of the Principal Act has been made, has not been taken before 29.11.2007. In other words to claim that vesting of the land in the State Government is saved, it will have to be shown by the State Government that the possession of the land in accordance with the provisions of the Principal Act has been taken by the Government before 29.11.2007. \t\t\t\t      [Para 11,14,15]"

Act.\n\nThe Legislature evolved the ULC Act for the purposes of achieving the following objectives :\n\n(i) to prevent concentration of urban property in the hands of a few persons and speculation and profiteering therein;\n\n(ii) to bring about socialization of urban land in urban agglomerations to subserve the common good by ensuring its equitable distribution;\n\n(iii) to discourage construction of luxury housing leading to conspicuous consumption of scarce building materials and to ensure the equitable utilisation of such materials; and\n\n(iv) to secure orderly urbanization.\n\nThe ULC Act is a central legislation enacted by the Parliament to achieve above objectives. However, the Parliament has no power to make laws for the State in respect of the matters relating to imposition of ceiling on vacant land in Urban agglomerations for the acquisition of such land in excess of the ceiling limit, to regulate the construction of buildings on such land and for matters connected therewith, except as provided in Articles 249 and 250 of the Constitution of India. Similarly, in pursuance of clause (1) of Article 52 of the Constitution, resolutions have been passed by all the houses of Legislatures of the States such as States of Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, Haryana, Himachal Pradesh, Karnataka, Maharashtra, Orissa, Punjab, Tripura, Uttar Pradesh and West Bengal, and as per these resolutions, the matters aforesaid should be regulated in those States by the laws made by the Parliament.\n\nNecessity to enact the ULC Act was felt by the Parliament since the demand for imposing ceiling on the urban properties was made by some of the State Governments in view of growth in population and increasing urbanization and therefore, it was necessary for orderly development of urban areas. It was, therefore, necessary to take measures for exercising social control over the scarce resources of urban land with a view to ensure its equitable distribution. Certain States have passed resolutions empowering the Parliament to undertake legislation in this behalf and therefore, the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Bill was introduced in the Parliament and the ULC Act came into force on 17.2.1976. The Urban Ceiling Act was enacted in order to provide imposition of ceiling on vacant land in urban agglomerations, for acquisition of excess vacant land by the State Government with powers to dispose of the same to subserve the common good, for payment of amount for acquisition of excess land, for granting exemption in respect of certain specific categories of vacant lands, for regulating the transfer of vacant lands within the ceiling limit, for regulating the transfer of urban or urbanizable lands with buildings for a stipulated period and for restricting plinth area for construction of future residential buildings etc. The provisions of ULC Act, therefore, empower the State Government to exercise power through different provisions of the ULC Act to achieve these objectives and neither the statements of objects and reasons nor the preamble of the ULC Act even remotely demonstrate that the Parliament ever intended to clothe the State with power to encroach upon the provisions of any other legislation or law for the time being in force including the MRTP Act.

Job of the Court is to interpret the Statute strictly on the basis of the language used in such Statute by the legislation. Therefore, though the State Government u/s.20(2) was competent to withdraw the order of exemption issued under sub-section (1) of Section 20, it will be wholly misconceived to hold that the State Government, therefore, also had a jurisdiction and power to cancel the order of sanction/building permit issued by the Planning Authority under the MRTP Act. The provisions of Section 20 did not permit the State Government to exercise power beyond the parameters mentioned in Section 20 of the ULC Act and therefore, exercise of power by the State Government beyond the ambit and scope of provisions of Section 20 would render such action of the State Government, to that extent, invalid in law. The power which was vested in the State Government u/s.20 of the ULC Act was limited to the extent of grant of exemption in respect of vacant land in excess of the ceiling limit subject to certain terms and conditions and to withdraw such order of exemption in case of breach of condition/s and therefore, any action of the State Government which was beyond the scope of such power conferred on it or jurisdiction vested in it u/s.20 would be without authority of law.\n\nThe order of exemption u/s.20(1) is passed by the State Government or the Competent Authority under the ULC Act in view of certain contingencies mentioned in sub-section (1) of Section 20, the Legislature has also empowered the State Government to withdraw such exemption; where as the MRTP Act is an independent legislation evolved for the purpose of regulating and monitoring the construction activity. The area of operation of the MRTP Act is completely different and distinct and therefore, the power exercised by the competent Authority under the MRTP Act while granting building permit/sanction is strictly as per the provisions of the MRTP Act. \t\t\t\t\t [Para 48,50]"

Act.\n\nPower vested in the State Government u/s.20 and 21 to exempt the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit though was similar, however, it is required to be exercised in different contingencies as mentioned in the respective provisions, however, the object to be achieved was one and the same i.e. to provide housing accommodation to the weaker section of the Society by formulating a Scheme which would serve a public good. Power u/s.20 was limited to grant of exemption; whereas u/s.21, in certain cases, the State was empowered to declare vacant land not to be treated as excess. The exemption order passed u/s.20 or declaration that the vacant land not to be treated as excess u/s.21 was subject to such terms and conditions mentioned in the Schemes which were evolved by the State Government. As already observed hereinabove, provisions of both these sections only empowered the State Government in case of breach of conditions of the Scheme, to withdraw the order of exemption as well as declare vacant land to be excess which was declared not to be treated as excess u/s.(1) of Section 21 of the ULC Act. Whereas provisions of neither of these Sections clothed the State Government with the jurisdiction or power to nullify the order/sanction/building permit granted or issued by the Planning Authority under the MRTP Act.

In view of this specific provision only the share of respondent Nos.1 and 2 had to be taken into consideration, as both of them together hold the said plot. Section 45 of the Transfer of Property Act deals with joint transfer for consideration and it lays down that where immovable property is transferred for consideration to two or more persons and such consideration is paid out of a fund belonging to them in common, they are, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, respectively entitled to interests in such property identical, as nearly as may be, with the interests to which they were respectively entitled in the fund; and where such consideration is paid out of separate funds belonging to them respectively, they are, in the absence of a contract to the contrary, respectively entitled to interests in such property in proportion to the shares of the consideration which they respectively advanced. The second paragraph of this Section lays down that in the absence of evidence as to the interests in the fund to which they were respectively entitled, or as to the  shares which they respectively advanced, such persons shall be presumed to be equally interested in the property. In view of this specific provision both the respondents shall be presumed to be owners of equal shares in the plot as there was no evidence to the cantrary.   [Para 4]"

Similarly, to come within the purview of Subsection (9) the person must hold vacant land and also any other land on which there is a building with a dwelling unit. The meaning of the expression \"any other land on which there is a building\" has been given in the Explanation to Section 4 and this shows that the person must either own the land and the building or own the land and possess the building or possess the land and the building or possess the land but own the building. Therefore, the ownership or possession of the land over which the building stands is a necessary condition for applicability of anyone of the Sub-sections of Section 4. The respondents have merely been allotted flats in a building owned by a co-operative society. There is absolutely no material on record to show that they are either owners of any land or they are in possession of any land. It is the housing co-operative society which is the owner of the land over which the building has been constructed and the respondents are merely allottees of one of the flats in the building. Therefore they cannot be held to be either owners of any land or in possession of any land and consequently Sub-section (8) or (9) of Section 4 would not apply.  In these circumstances, the view taken by the Competent Authority and the Appellate Authority that the area of the flats in Bombay had to be clubbed with the vacant land held by the respondents in Pune was patently wrong and the High Court has rightly set aside the same.

If the Defendant handed over the application to the Plaintiff, it would be for the Plaintiff to file and pursue the necessary application. The Plaintiff was the purchaser of the suit land with various occupants. The suit land admeasures 681 sq. meters equivalent to about 815 sq. yards. It would otherwise fall within the mis-chief of ULCRA and require the vacant land to be handed over to the Government. The Defendant would, therefore, be expected only to fill in the relevant forms to be submitted. The Plaintiff would be expected to do the ministerial acts. This is evident from the latter part of Clause 14 of the agreement which states that if the permission was not granted, it was not to be considered a default on the part of the vendors. The Defendant is not expected to take the receipt from the Plaintiff of having handed over the returns required to be filed. A reading of Clauses 2 and 14 of the agreement coupled with the fact that the land was fully occupied does show that all that the Defendants were required to do was to make their application for permission upon filing their returns and the Plaintiff would thereafter pursue that application to obtain the permission. If that could not be obtained expeditiously, the parties would extend the time and make time the essence of the contract. Consequently, based upon the oral evidence of the Defendant read with Clauses 2 and 14 of the agreement, it can be seen that the Defendants were not, strictly speaking, to obtain permission for sale from the competent authority under the ULCRA but were to only sign the application in that behalf.\t\t [Para 27,28]"

All that is not saved in Section 3 should get abated by virtue of operation of Section 4. The submission made by petitioners that the proviso to Section 4 will have application as possession was admittedly not taken is not tenable. The reason is that Section 3(1)(b) in terms protects any scheme sanctioned or order passed on the application under Section 20 of the Act of 1976 granting exemption before the commencement of the Urban Land (Ceiling And Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999. That being so, in the instant case the exemption order was passed by Hon'ble Chief Minister on 23/11/2007 and the said order remained as it is. However, after repeal in the State of Maharashtra w.e.f. 01/12/2007, the validity of that order cannot be challenged due to the bar of Section 3(1)(b) of the Urban Land (Ceiling And Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999 providing for 'Saving'. The reason appears to be the consideration of providing for the need of the beneficiaries for whom schemes were sanctioned under Section 20 of the Act of 1976 by exemption before the repeal.\n\nSection 20 of the Act of 1976 has not been inserted in the proviso to Section 4 of Urban Land (Ceiling And Regulation) Repeal Act, 1999, in order that schemes sanctioned and the orders of exemption made under Section 20 of the Act of 1976 are saved.\n\n2009 ALL SCR (O.C.C.) 10 Ref. to.\t    [Para 12]"

The question does arise as to whether absence of limitation in Section 34 confers unfettered power to vary or revoke the order of the prescribed authority without any outside limitation in point of duration i.e. does it confer an everlasting or interminable power in point of time. If the contention that such provisions of Section 34 do not prescribe any limitation, and it confers an interminable power upon the State Government in point of time to exercise the Revisional power, is accepted, there will be no finality of the proceedings taken under the Act, 1976.   [Para 19]\n\nThe legislature in its wisdom did not fix a time limit for exercising the revisional power nor inserted the words \"at any time\" in Section 34 of the Act, 1976. It does not mean that the legislature intended to leave the orders passed under the Act open to variation for an indefinite period inasmuch as it would have the effect of rendering title of the holders/allottee(s) permanently precarious and in a state of perpetual uncertainty. In case, it is assumed that the legislature has conferred an everlasting and interminable power in point of time, the title over the declared surplus land, in the hands of the State/allottee, would forever remain virtually insecure. The Court has to construe the statutory provision in a way which makes the provisions workable, advancing the purpose and object of enactment of the statute. In view of the above, the Revisional powers cannot be used arbitrarily at belated stage for the reason that the order passed in Revision under Section 34 of the Act, 1976, is a judicial order.

Dharmadhikari and G.S. Kulkarni, JJ. (Majority):- \n\nThough it would be open for the State to enforce the exemption order and terms and conditions thereof, validity of which is saved by the Repeal Act, but having regard to the language of Section 20(2) of the Principal Act it cannot be held that same can be enforced only by withdrawal of the order of exemption in terms of sub-section (2) of Section 20, which power also survives the repeal of the Principal Act. In other words, though Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act read with Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 states that repeal of the Principal Act shall not affect the validity of the exemption order passed under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act or any action taken thereunder notwithstanding any judgment of any court to the contrary, still the obligations and liabilities incurred voluntarily under the exemption order by the person holding the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit need not be enforced only by exercise of powers under sub-section (2) of Section 20 of the Principal Act, but by all other legally per-missible means.\n\nWhether any of these powers could be exercised and to what extent are all matters which must be decided in the facts and circumstances of each case. In the event the State desires to take any action in terms of Section 20(2) of the Principal Act it would be open for the aggrieved parties to urge that such an action is not permissible in the given facts and circumstances particularly because of enormous and unexplained delay, the parties having altered their position to their detriment, the proceedings as also the orders in that behalf are grossly unfair, unjust, arbitrary, high handed, malafide and violative of the principles of natural justice and of the Constitutional mandate enshrined in Articles 14, 19(1)(g), 21 and 300A of the Constitution of India.\n\nIn the light of the wording of Section 20(2) of the Principal Act the State is competent to withdraw, but only after giving a reasonable opportunity to the persons concerned for making representation against the proposed withdrawal. The Government is obliged to pass an order withdrawing any exemption and needless to clarify that in the event such an order is passed it can be impugned and challenged by the aggrieved parties in appropriate proceedings on the grounds that it is unreasoned and/or in the given facts and circumstances such an order could not have been passed or need not be passed and the Government could have granted time to comply with the terms and conditions or that the terms and conditions relying on which and for breach of which the exemption order is withdrawn are not violated or breached, they were not mandatory and have been substantially complied with or were incapable of being complied with because of several factors, obstacles and hurdles each of which cannot be enumerated or termed as exhaustive in any manner. Therefore, if the Government is not mandated to withdraw the exemption order, but can ensure compliance of the terms and conditions without withdrawal of the exemption order or without recourse to Section 20(2) of the Principal Act, then, needless to clarify that all liabilities, obligations and equally the remedies available to the parties are unaffected by repeal and can be resorted to in the afore stated events. [Para 135]\n\nPer S.C. Gupte, J. (Contra):-\n\nThere is no question of enforcement of the order of exemption under Section 20(1) or its terms and conditions, in accordance with the provisions of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976. Neither can the exemption granted under Section 20(1) of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976 be withdrawn for breach of conditions under Section 20(2) nor can Chapter III be applied to the land exempted under Section 20(1) after withdrawal of the exemption under Section 20(2) of the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976.\n\nThe order of exemption can be implemented or enforced in any manner acceptable to law, if, and to the extent, such order could be implemented or enforced otherwise than by recourse to the Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act, 1976. The State may enforce the order together with its conditions through a Court of law or devise any legislative or executive means to implement the order of exemption and its conditions. The enforceability of the order, and legality of the measure adopted for its implementation will, however, have to be decided in the facts and circumstances of each individual case.\n\nThe State cannot recall/cancel/modify any exemption order granted under Section 20 of the Principal Act at any time after the coming into force of the Repeal Act.

                "description": "Overriding provisions - Provisions under SICA cannot override provisions of ULC Act - Even where an exemption is granted u/s.20 from provisions of ULC Act, SICA would not get overriding effect - An administrative order u/s.20 of ULC Act cannot wipe out statutory effect of S.32 of SICA or S.42 of ULC Act.\n\nThe provisions contained in Section 42 of ULC make it clear that the provisions of ULC shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith in any other law for the time being in force or any custom, usage, agreement, decree or order of a court, tribunal or other authority. Just as the SICA would constitute 'other law' so also the BIFR and AAIFR would constitute 'Tribunal or any other Authority' as contemplated by Section 42 of the ULC. The over riding effect conferred by the legislature upon the provisions of ULC is not qualified. This is further clear upon comparison of this provision with Section 32 of the SICA.\n\nThe provisions contained in SICA override other laws 'except the provisions of FERA and ULC'. At the stage when SICA came to be enacted, the Parliament was very much aware of the provisions contained in the ULC. Normally there is a presumption that the legislature while enacting a law has complete knowledge of the existing laws which may or may not be affected by the enactment proposed to be enacted. In the present case, the Parliament, in enacting Section 32 of SICA has taken express cognizance of the provisions contained in the ULC. Thus, the legislative intent is quite clear in that the provisions of ULC shall have a primacy over the provisions of SICA, in case of any inconsistency between the two.\n\nAn exemption granted by an executive or administrative authority can not wipe out the statutory effect of the provisions contained either in Section 32 of the SICA or more particularly Section 42 of the ULC. The provisions of Section 20 of ULC, under which the exemption came to be granted authorised the Government to exempt property (excess vacant land) from the applicability of Chapter III, which comprises Sections 3 to 24. Section 42 of ULC is not a part of Chapter III of ULC. It is one thing to assert that notices, orders or action under Section 10 of ULC, which are administrative in nature, are incompetent as long as exemption order under Section 20 of the ULC subsists, however, it is quite another proposition to assert that the provisions of ULC shall not at all be applicable to any proceedings under SICA in regard to property covered by an exemption notification, notwithstanding the express language of Section 32 of SICA AND Section 42 of ULC. The latter broader proposition, is unacceptable.  [Para 29,30,33]"

Sub-section (3) of Section 10 contained two deeming provisions such as \"deemed to have been acquired\" and \"deemed to have been vested absolutely\". In interpreting the provision creating a legal fiction, the Court is to ascertain for what purpose the fiction is created and after ascertaining this, the Court is to assume all those facts and consequences which are incidental or inevitable corollaries to the giving effect to the fiction what can be deemed to exist under a legal fiction are facts and not legal consequences which do not flow from the law as it stands. \n\n(1996) 2 SCC 449 Rel. on.     [Para 17]\n\nThe expression \"acquired\" and \"vested\" are not defined under the Act. Each word, phrase or sentence that we get in a statutory provision, if not defined in the Act, then is to be construed in the light of the general purpose of the Act. The expression \"deemed to have been acquired\" used as a deeming fiction under sub-section (3) of Section 10 can only mean acquisition of title or acquisition of interests because till that time the land may be either in the ownership of the person who held that vacant land or to possess such land as owner or as a tenant or as mortgagee and so on as defined under Section 2(1) of the Act. The word \"vested\" has not been defined in the Act, so also the word \"absolutely\". What is vested absolutely is only the land which is deemed to have acquired and nothing more. The word \"vest\" has different meaning in different context; especially when we examine the meaning of vesting on the basis of a statutory hypothesis of a deeming provision.\n\nVest/vested, therefore, may or may not include \"transfer of possession\" the meaning of which depends on the context in which it has been placed and the interpretation of various other related provisions. \n\nWhat is deemed \"vesting absolutely\" is that \"what is deemed to have acquired\". There must be express words of utmost clarity to persuade a court to hold that the legislature intended to divest possession also, since the owners or holders of the vacant land is pitted against a statutory hypothesis. Possession, there is an adage is \"nine points of law\".\n\nIn so far as the present case is concerned, the word \"vesting\" takes in every interest in the property including de jure possession and, not de facto but it is always open to a person to voluntarily surrender and deliver possession, under Section 10(3) of the Act.

                "description": "Exemption order - Withdrawal after repeal of Principal Act - Permissibility - Held, power of withdrawal is implicit and inherent in power to grant exemption - Such power is not repealed - Even though saving clause u/s.3(1)(b) of Repeal Act does not speak of S.20(2), Power of withdrawal is saved by virtue of S.56 of General Clauses Act.\n\nPer S.C. Dharmadhikari and G.S. Kulkarni, JJ. (Majority):-\n\nThe Legislature was aware that not only the terms and conditions of the exemption order need to be enforced, but if that order is acted upon by parties the validity as a whole must be saved. That needs to be saved so as to enable the State Government to apply the provisions of Chapter-III to the excess vacant land covered by the exemption order and the terms and conditions after it is noticed that the exemption is either misused or misutilized or not acted upon so as to subserve the larger public interest. A breach or violation of some of its vital conditions may result in its withdrawal and cancellation. If one way of applying Chapter-III is by withdrawing the exemption order, then, the power to withdraw the same which is implicit and inherent in the power to grant exemption is also saved and not affected by repeal of the Principal Act. Therefore, once the power of exemption can be exercised after the excess vacant land has vested in the State, then, equally the power to withdraw the exemption can also be exercised in case of such vacant land.\n\nAbsence of sub-section (2) of Section 20 of the Principal Act in clause (b) of sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Repeal Act would that the power to withdraw the exemption is not saved. It is possible that the power to withdraw the exemption may not be exercised in every case. However, when the State exercises the power to exempt the vacant land in excess of ceiling limit and which has already vested in it, then, there is no impediment in withdrawing the exemption from applicability of Chapter-III of the Principal Act in the case of such lands.     [Para 63]\n\nThe repeal of the Principal Act shall not affect the validity of the order of exemption under Section 20(1) of the Principal Act and all consequences following the same including keeping intact the power to withdraw the said exemption by recourse to Section 20(2) of the Principal Act. Further, merely because Section 20(2) is not specifically mentioned in the saving clause enacted by Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act that does not mean that the power is not saved. The said power is also saved by virtue of applicability of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. That Section of the General Clauses Act, 1897 applies to Section 3(1)(b) of the Repeal Act.\n\n(b) Once having held that the power to withdraw the exemption also survives the repeal of the Principal Act, then, all consequences must follow and the said power can be exercised by the State Government in accordance with law.\n\nThat power and equally all ancillary and incidental powers to the main power to impose conditions are also saved and survive the repeal. Meaning thereby the terms and conditions of the order of exemption can be enforced in accordance with law.\n\n2000 (123) ELT 3 (SC) Disting.\n\nW.P. 26474/2009 (A.P.), W.P. (Civ) 2455/1992 (Delhi), W.P. 11929/2013 (A.P.) Dissented from.\n\nAIR 1996 SC 2553, 2000(2) ALL MR 222 (S.C.), (1996) 3 SCC 690 Ref.to.  [Para 56,60,135]\n\nPer S.C. Gupta, J. (Contra) :-\n\nThe exemption order, as rightly noted by brother Dharmadhikari J, grants a privilege, but such privilege is granted on certain conditions. The entire exemption order would be valid, that is to say, both the privilege and the conditions would be valid. In the absence of any valid reasons, it cannot possibly be suggested that only the privilege is valid and not the conditions on which it is granted.\n\nNow the question is, what are the consequences of such validity. The obvious consequences, which are provided in the Repeal Act itself, are (a) all actions taken under the exemption order are valid and (b) payment made thereunder to the State Government is valid. But what are the other consequences. Could it be that the breach of the conditions of a valid exemption order would attract the provisions of Section 20(2) and all provisions of Chapter III including those relating to vesting of the land would thereupon apply to such land (i.e. land becoming excess vacant land as a result of withdrawal of exemption under Section 20(2)).\n\nThere are clear indications in the Repeal Act that these consequences are not contemplated. In the first place, withdrawal of an exemption order renders the land 'excess vacant land' just as any other vacant land which is in excess of the ceiling limit and which is not subject to an exemption order under Section 20(1). If such other vacant land could not continue to be vested in the State Government even after the provisions of Section 10(3) applied to it, if possession of the land was not already taken by the Government on the date of the repeal, there is no reason why the provisions of Section 20(2) and consequences of withdrawal of exemption thereunder should apply to a land which is exempted under Section 20(1), but conditions of such exemption are breached as on, or after, the date of the repeal.\n\nNeither the savings clause of the Repeal Act nor Section 6 of the General Clauses Act saves the provisions of Section 20(2) or the applicability of Chapter III of the Principal Act in relation to an exemption order passed under Section 20(1). If the conditions of exemption granted under Section 20(1) are breached, neither can the exemption be withdrawn after the repeal nor could Chapter III be applied to the land upon withdrawal of such exemption after the repeal. There is no question of the State Government seeking to acquire such land any time after the repeal.\n\nWhat is saved by the saving clause of the repealing statute is the validity of an exemption order, and it means the validity of both the exemption and the conditions on which it is granted. But that does not mean that the breach of any condition of the exemption order can be visited with the consequence of either withdrawal of exemption under Section 20(2) or application of Chapter III of the Principal Act to the land. At the same time, if it were permissible to implement or enforce the exemption order in any manner acceptable to law otherwise than by recourse to Section 20(2) or Chapter III of the Principal Act, such implementation or enforcement is permissible even after the repeal.

Act - Cannot be revoked or cancelled by State Government in exercise of powers vested under S.20 or 21 of ULC Act - Hence, Government Resolution dt.08-11-2007, Cl.2(a), held, cannot be sustained in law.\n\nSub-clause (a) of Clause (2) of the Government Resolution dt. 8.11.2007 stipulates that where permission was granted by the Planning Authority for construction of multi-storied building in the Special Plot Scheme and the construction activity has not been commenced prior to 12.4.2007, all such permissions/sanctions given by the Planning Authority stand cancelled and it is binding on the scheme holder to implement the Scheme in its original nature.  The State Government was empowered, u/s. 20 and 21 of the ULC Act, to formulate the Schemes and impose conditions as it deems fit, and in case of breach of conditions, power of withdrawal of Exemption Certificate was also vested in the State Government.  However, there is absolute no power vested in the State Government either u/s. 20, 21 or any other provisions of the ULC Act to nullify or cancel the order passed or building permit issued by the Planning Authority under the MRTP Act. Breach of condition by the land holder or holder of the scheme did not clothe the State Government with the jurisdiction to cancel or revoke the order of the Planning Authority, though the State Government could withdraw the exemption granted u/s.20 or take such action against the scheme holder as provided u/s.21 of the ULC Act.\n\nSimilarly, so far as other clauses of both these impugned Government Resolutions are concerned, which were evolved for the purpose of regularising the irregularity committed by the Scheme/land holder, the State Government was also not empowered either under the provisions of Section 20 or 21 or under any other provisions of the Act, in case of construction carried out by the land/scheme holder was inconsistent with the building permit, to initiate action, if any and there was also no power vested in the State Government either u/s.20 or 21 to regularise the irregularity committed by the land/scheme holder with regard to the terms and conditions of the building permit or order of sanction issued by the Planning Authority. It is well settled that in case of any construction which was inconsistent with the building permit or building bye-laws, it is the competent Authority under the provisions of the MRTP Act alone who is competent to initiate action under the provisions of the said Act and the State Government cannot assume such power which was not provided under the provisions of the ULC Act, except withdrawal of exemption granted u/s. 20 of the Act. If the State Government is permitted to regularise the illegal construction carried out by the land or Scheme holder which is inconsistent with the building permit or sanction order issued by the Planning Authority, such action of the State Government will not only be without the authority of law, but the same also shall render the provisions of MRTP Act negatory and therefore, the impugned Government Resolutions, cannot be sustained in law.

                "description": "Reference of instrument of conveyance if found undervalued - Circle rate referred to under Rule 340-A is merely a guideline and it does not take away the right of the person subjected to pay stamp duty to prove that the valuation given in the deed is not undervalued - Rule 340-A does not restrict the Collector to give the circle rates differently for two years.\n\n\tSub-section (1) of Section 47-A provides, in case valuation described in an instrument is less than the minimum value determined in accordance with the said rule then such officer shall refer it to the Collector for ascertainment of the market value of such property, for levying proper duty on such instrument.   Sub-section (2) is without prejudice to sub-section (1). Similarly, under it if the Registering Officer believes that the market value of the property described in an instrument has not been truly set forth, he may, after registering such instrument refer the same to the Collector for determination of true market value of such property. So, this Court finds both under sub-sections (1) and (2) where the value described in such instrument is less than the minimum value fixed under the Rules or even otherwise if such Registering  Officer under  sub-section (2) has reason to believe that the market value of the property has not been truly set forth he may refer the matter to the Collector for true ascertainment of its market value.  On receipt of such reference by the Collector under sub-section (3) he issues notice to the concerned party and after giving such party reasonable opportunity of being heard, may be after holding an enquiry determine the market value  of such  property.   Reading Section 47-A with the aforesaid Rule 340-A it is clear that the circle rate fixed by the Collector is not final but is only a prima facie determination of rate of an area concerned only to give guidance to the Registering Authority to test prima facie whether the instrument has properly described the value of the property.  The circle rate under this Rule is neither final for the authority nor to one subjected to pay the stamp duty. So far sub-sections (1) and (2) it is very limited in its application as it only directs the Registering Authority to refer to the Collector for determination in case property is under valued in such instrument. The circle rate does not take away the right of such person to show that the property in question be correctly valued as he gets an opportunity in case of under valuation to prove it before the Collector after reference is made. This also marks the dividing line for the exercise of power between the Registering Authority and the Collector.   In case the valuation in the instrument is same as recorded in the circle rate or is truly described it could be registered by Registering Authority but in case it is under valued in terms of sub-section (1) or sub-section (2), it has to be referred and decided by the Collector. Thus, the circle rate, as aforesaid, is merely a guideline and is also indicative of division of exercise of power between the Registering Authority and the Collector.  [Para 4]\n\nUnder Rule 340-A Collector has to supply biennially to the District Registrar a copy of the statement recording circle rate and average price of land etc., in every pargana, corporation or local body of his district. The supply of biennial statement would only mean supplying such statement once in two years but while supplying that statement there is no inhibition either under this Rule or any other Rule or under the Act nor any pointed out which restricts the Collector to give such rate differently for two years. The restriction, if any, is that such statement shall only be supplied once in two years. If there be any material in possession of the Collector clearly indicating a regular pattern of increasing percentage of the prices of land every year then to that extent if he in his biennial statement refers to such increase for the following years it cannot be said that the Collector lacks competence to exercise such power.  As this Court said, this assessment by the Collector is only prima facie and is not final and is open to both the Authorities or person seeking registration to prove to the contrary the actual market value of such property. This circle rate in no way affects any party when finally determining its value.  [Para 5]"

It lays down that a mere membership of a terrorist gang or organization which is involved in terrorist act would invite punishment: and that too, a drastic punishment inasmuch as the imprisonment that can be awarded for being a member of such a gang or organization, can be for life. Grant of bail to a person arrested on such a charge would be difficult in view of the provisions of sub-section (5) of section 43D, as the discretion available to the Courts is curtailed thereby. Undoubtedly, Article 19(2) empowers the Parliament to impose, by law, reasonable restrictions on these rights in the interests of sovereignty and integrity of India. Section 20 has been enacted as and by way of reasonable restriction on the aforesaid freedoms and rights, guaranteed by the Constitution. Inasmuch as the said clause imposes restrictions on the aforesaid freedoms and rights, the interpretation thereof has to be in consonance with the constitutional values and principles, and the concept of membership contemplated by the said section, is required to be interpreted in the light of the aforesaid freedoms and rights. It follows that considering from this point of view, the membership of a terrorist gang or organization as contemplated by section 20, cannot be a passive membership. It has to be treated as an active membership which results in participation of the acts of the terrorist gang or organization which are performed for carrying out the aims and objects of such gang or organization by means of violence or other unlawful means. \t  [Para 17,20,21]"

Whereas now, after the amendment, such Bail Applications are to be considered as per these provisions of sub-clause (5) of Section 43-D. By way of this Amendment, two additional conditions are laid down, like, opportunity of being heard on the application of bail being extended to the P.P. before passing any order on the Bail Application of the Accused and second condition to the effect that the accused shall not be released on bail, if, on perusal of the Case Diary or the Report made under Section 173 of the Code, the Court is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against such person is prima facie true. \t\t [Para 48]\n\n\tNo doubt, these two conditions are in addition to the conditions laid down under the Code on granting of bail; however, these conditions do not in any way, affect or restrict the right, if any, of the accused to be released on bail. Even while deciding the Bail Application of the Accused, as per the provisions of the Code, Public Prosecutor is heard and, secondly, under the provisions of the Code also, the Court always ensures as to whether the accusation against the accused person is prima facie true. If it is so, then his right to get the bail becomes restricted. Therefore, effectually, there are no such further restrictions laid down by the Amendment Act on the right of accused, if any, of the bail. Hence, this Amendment cannot be considered as substantively affecting the right of accused. \t [Para 49]\n\n\tWhatever alleged restrictions are put on the rights of the accused to get bail under the provisions of Section 43-D(5) of the UAP Act, they are required to be held as procedural in nature and, therefore, can be said to be having retrospective effect.\n\n2014 ALL SCR (O.C.C.) 268, AIR 1996 SC 290 Rel. on. 2005 ALL MR (Cri) 1538 (S.C.)

The elaborate examination or dissection of the evidence is not required to be done at this stage. The Court is merely expected to record a finding on the basis of broad probabilities regarding the involvement of the accused in the commission of the stated offence or otherwise. From the analysis of the impugned judgment, it appears that the High Court has ventured into an area of examining the merits and demerits of the evidence. For, it noted that the evidence in the form of statements of witnesses under Section 161 are not admissible. Further, the documents pressed into service by the Investigating Agency were not admissible in evidence. It also noted that it was unlikely that the document had been recovered from the residence of co-accused. The approach of the High Court in completely discarding the statements of the protected witnesses recorded under Section 164 of Cr.P.C., on the specious ground that the same was kept in a sealed cover and was not even perused by the Designated Court and also because reference to such statements were not found in the chargesheet, is in complete disregard of the duty of the Court to record its opinion that the accusation made against the concerned accused is prima facie true or otherwise. \t [Para 18]\n\n\tThe totality of the material gathered by the Investigating Agency and presented along with the report and including the case diary, is required to be reckoned and not by analysing individual pieces of evidence or circumstance. In any case, the question of discarding the document at this stage, on the ground of being inadmissible in evidence, is not permissible. For, the issue of admissibility of the document/evidence would be a matter for trial. The Court must look at the contents of the document and take such document into account as it is. \t\t [Para 19]"

Act with respect to the grant of bail is not similar to the one contained in the M.C.O.C. Act, and has been worded differently. It contemplates that a person accused of having committed an offence punishable under Chapter IV and Chapter VI of the U.A.P. Act shall not be released on bail if there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against such person is prima facie true. Perhaps, this phrase puts a greater restriction on the powers of the court than is put by the aforesaid provision of the M.C.O.C. Act. However, inspite of the difference in the phraseology, there would be no basic difference in the practical application of these provisions. All that these provisions lay down is that a person arrested on the accusation of having committed the offence contemplated by the said provisions should not be released on bail, if there would be a prima facie case of such offence against him. If a rational and reasonable doubt is felt in that regard, then the court would not be precluded from granting bail even in such cases. Moreover, judging the existence of a prima facie case at the stage of bail, would not be the same as judging the existence of a prima facie case for proceeding against an accused by framing a Charge.\n\nIt is too obvious that an accused would never be required to put forth a stronger case for bail, than that would be required for a discharge. The tests that are applied at the time of bail cannot be as rigorous as are applied while considering the discharge of an accused from a particular case. The position as to when an accused can be discharged has not been changed by the legislature in cases of the offences punishable under the M.C.O.C. Act and the U.A.P. Act, inspite of introducing provisions curtailing the discretion of the court in the matter of grant of bail - although only in the event of the application being opposed by the Public Prosecutor.\t         [Para 27,28]"

By way of this Amendment, two additional conditions are laid down, like, opportunity of being heard on the application of bail being extended to the P.P. before passing any order on the Bail Application of the Accused and second condition to the effect that the accused shall not be released on bail, if, on perusal of the Case Diary or the Report made under Section 173 of the Code, the Court is of the opinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against such person is prima facie true.  [Para 44]\n\nNo doubt, these two conditions are in addition to the conditions laid down under the Code on granting of bail; however, these conditions do not, in any way, affect or restrict the right, if any, of the applicant to be released on bail. Even while deciding the Bail Application of the Accused, as per the provisions of the Code, Public Prosecutor is heard and; secondly, under the provisions of the Code also, the Court always ensures as to whether the accusation against the accused person is prima facie true. If it is so, then his right to get the bail becomes restricted. Therefore, effectually, there are no such further restrictions laid down by the Amendment Act on the applicant's right, if any, of the bail. Hence, this Amendment cannot be considered as substantively affecting the right of Applicant. \t [Para 45]\n\nMoreover, in this case, admittedly, the offences alleged against the Applicant are non-bailable and punishable with imprisonment for life or death, as she is also charged for the offences under Section 302, 120B etc. of IPC. Therefore, under the provisions of the Code also, it cannot be said that the Applicant has any substantive right to be released on bail, similar to the right the accused is having in the case of bailable offences. Therefore, Applicant cannot claim to have any \"vested right\" to be released on bail under the provisions of the Code. \t [Para 46]\n\nTherefore, it is to be held that whatever alleged restrictions are put on the rights of the accused to get bail under the provisions of Section 43-D(5) of the UAP Act, they are required to be held as procedural in nature and, therefore, can be said to be having retrospective effect. 2014 ALL SCR (O.C.C.) 268, AIR 1996 SC 290 Rel. on.

It clearly shows that, \"State Government\" is also authorized to accord sanction under this provision. It is clear that from 31st December 2008, sub-section (2) of Section 45 of UAP Act was inserted, thereby directing both, the Central and State Government, to create one independent Reviewing Authority and casting obligation on the Sanctioning Authority of Central Government, or, as the case may be, the State Government to consider the report of this Authority before according the sanction. Thus, it can be seen that both the Central Government as well as the State Government are empowered to appoint the said Reviewing Authority, thereby indicating that both the Central Government and State Government are competent to accord the sanction. Otherwise, there was no reason for directing the State Government also to appoint such independent Authority.\n\nThe absence of the words, the 'State Government', while defining the \"authority\" as well as while prescribing the \"time limit for making recommendation by the authority\" and \"time limit for sanction of prosecution\" in the Rules, cannot take away the authority of the State Government, given to it under the Section. In our considered opinion, such Rules, which are framed in exercise of delegated legislation, cannot take away the authority, which was vested in the State Government in view of Section 45(ii) of UAP Act. Hence, it cannot be accepted that from 31st December 2008 to 31st March 2009, State Government had no authority to accord sanction under Section 45(ii) of the UAP Act.  [Para 69,70]"

                "description": "Position u/S.167 as applicable in case under UAPA - Explained - Grant of Police custody - Maximum period of 15 days u/S.167 - Extended to 30 days under UAPA - But it must be within first 30 days of remand - Person who is remanded to judicial custody and NIA has not been given police custody during first 30 days - It is open to Court to give police custody even beyond 30 days from date of first remand on reasons given, explaining delay.\nThe position under S.167 as applicable in cases under UAPA is as follows:-\nUndoubtedly, the period of 30 days is permissible by way of police custody. This Court will proceed on the basis that the legislature is aware of the existing law when it brings the changes in the law. In other words, this Court had laid down in Anupam Kulkarni, 1992 ALLMR ONLINE 1079, inter alia, that under S.167 which provides for 15 days as the maximum period of police custody, the custody of an accused with the police can be given only during the first 15 days from the date of the remand by the Magistrate. Beyond 15 days, the remand can only be given to judicial custody. Ordinarily, since the period of 15 days has been increased to 30 days, the effect would be that in cases falling under UAPA applying the principle declared in 1992 ALLMR ONLINE 1079, the investigating officer in a case under UAPA, can get police custody for a maximum period of 30 days but it must be within the first 30 days of the remand. In this regard, the number of days alone is increased for granting remand to police custody. The principle that it should be the first 30 days has not been altered in cases under UAPA. As far as the second proviso in Section 43(D)(2)(b) is concerned, it does bring about an alteration of the law in Anupam Kulkarni. It is contemplated that a person who is remanded to judicial custody and NIA has not been given police custody during the first 30 days, on reasons being given and also on explaining the delay, Court may grant police custody. The proviso brings about the change in the law to the extent that if a person is in judicial custody on the basis of the remand, then on reasons given, explaining the delay, it is open to the Court to give police custody even beyond 30 days from the date of the first remand. S.49 (2) of Prevention of Terrorism Act is pari material which has been interpreted by this Court in AIR 2004 SC 3946 and the decision does not advance the case of Appellant though that was a case where the police custody was sought of a person in judicial custody but beyond 30 days. In this regard, it would appear that the appellant had surrendered on 14.04.2020. He was not in judicial custody. He was produced with a remand report seeking police custody on 15.04.2020. Treating this as a remand sought within the first 30 days, a remand is ordered for a period of 7 days initially. There is no dispute that the period was police custody. An accused under UAPA may be sent to judicial custody, police custody or granted bail. If the argument that the police custody can be sought at any time and it is not limited to cases where there is judicial custody, it will go against the clear terms of the proviso and even a person who is bailed out can after 30 days be remanded to police custody. This is untenable. The case of the appellant that the police custody granted on 15.04.2020 was permissible and consistent with his case does not appear to be correct. (Para 128)"

A perusal of the impugned judgment and order clearly shows that no such exercise was undertaken by the NIA Court and, there was no reference to the reasoning given in the earlier orders whereby the bail applications were rejected by the court. Merely because some prosecution witnesses had been examined, some of whom had turned hostile, could not be a ground to revisit findings on merits rendered twice over when earlier bail applications of the respondent were rejected. If such procedure of moving bail applications on merits upon examination of some prosecution witnesses is permitted, there would be no end to such applications being moved by the accused, thereby derailing the trial proceedings and asking the courts to revisit findings on merits on half baked evidence. If such an approach is permitted, the accused may move successive bail applications during the course of examination of further prosecution witnesses and conversely the prosecution may move applications for cancellation of bail already granted, by relying on evidence brought on record during the course of examination of prosecution witnesses. This cannot be permitted. (Paras 23, 41)\n\n\tSuch approach cannot be countenanced particularly in the backdrop of the fact that the finding regarding prima facie truth about the accusations had been rendered twice over against the respondent when the earlier two bail applications were rejected on merits. (Para 26)\n\n\tThe fresh grounds on which the NIA Court proceeded in the present case in favour of the respondent cannot be said to be fresh grounds at all and merely because some of the prosecution witnesses stood already examined, it could not be a ground for revisiting the findings already rendered against the respondent-accused. The NIA Court certainly ignored relevant considerations, including the reasoning given in earlier orders rejecting the applications for bail on merits. Considering evidence of 49 witnesses already examined, when 107 witnesses remained to be examined, was an irrelevant consideration taken into account by the NIA Court while holding in favour of the respondent by the impugned judgment and order. (Para 27)\n\n\tFurther such findings rendered on the touchstone of proviso to Section 43D(5) of the UAPA do not deserve to be re-visited by detailed consideration of the charge-sheet again, merely because some prosecution witnesses have been examined, which according to the respondent, do not seem to support the case of the prosecution.

It is of no moment that the Criminal Court in question either does not dispose of such application before the charge sheet is filed or disposes of such application wrongly before such charge sheet is filed. So long as an application has been made for default bail on expiry of the stated period before time is further extended to the maximum period of 180 days, default bail, being an indefeasible right of the accused under the first proviso to Section 167(2), kicks in and must be granted. (Para 28)\n\tIn the instant case it cannot be said that once the challan was presented by the prosecution on 25.03.2019 as an application was filed by the Appellant on 26.03.2019, the Appellant is not entitled to default bail. In fact the application that was made for default bail was made on or before 25.02.2019 and not 26.03.2019. The charge sheet was filed on 26.03.2019 and not 25.03.2019. The fact that this application was wrongly dismissed on 25.02.2019 would make no difference and ought to have been corrected in revision. The sole ground for dismissing the application was that the time of 90 days had already been extended by the learned Sub-Divisional Judicial Magistrate, Ajnala by his order dated 13.02.2019. This Order was correctly set aside by the Special Court by its judgment dated 25.03.2019, holding that under the UAPA read with the NIA Act, the Special Court alone had jurisdiction to extend time to 180 days under the first proviso in Section 43-D(2)(b). The fact that the Appellant filed yet another application for default bail on 08.04.2019, would not mean that this application would wipe out the effect of the earlier application that had been wrongly decided. The right to default bail, are not mere statutory rights under the first proviso to Section 167(2) of the Code, but is part of the procedure established by law under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, which is, therefore, a fundamental right granted to an accused person to be released on bail once the conditions of the first proviso to Section 167(2) are fulfilled. This being the case, the Appellant would be entitled to be released on \u201cdefault bail\u201d under Section 167(2) of the Code, as amended by Section 43-D of the UAPA. (Para 29)"

Act, 1972 - Interpretation of statutes - Principle of casus omissus.\n\nSection 34 of the Act consists of two parts. Sub-section (1) deals with the overriding effect of the Act notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any other law for the time being in force or in any instrument having effect by virtue of any law other than the Act. Sub-section (1) itself makes an exception as regards matters covered by sub-section (2). The U.P. Act is not mentioned therein. The mode of recovery of debt under the U.P. Act is not saved under the said provision i.e. sub-section (2) which is of considerable importance. Even a bare reading therein makes it clear that it is intended to be in addition to and not in derogation of certain statutes; one of which is the Financial Act. In other words, a Bank or Financial Institution has the option or choice to proceed either under the Act or under the modes of recovery permissible under the Financial Act. To that extent, the High Court's conclusions quoted above were correct. Where the High Court went wrong is by holding that proceedings under the U.P. Act were permissible, U.P. Act deals with separate modes of recovery and such proceedings are not relatable to proceedings under the Financial Act.  [Para 9]\n\nThe plea that mode of recovery under U.P. Act has to be read into S.34 of Recovery Act by application of principles known as casus omissus and the deficiency, if any, can be reconciled by purposive interpretation by reading the said statute as a whole and finding out the true legislative intent is not tenable.  Two principles of construction - one relating to casus omissus and the other in regard to reading the statute as a whole appear to be well settled. Under the first principle a casus omissus cannot be supplied by the Court except in the case of clear necessity and when reason for it is found in the four corners of the statute itself but at the same time a casus omissus should not be readily inferred and for that purpose all the parts of a statute or section must be construed together and every clause of a section should be construed with reference to the context and other clauses thereof so that the construction to be put on a particular provision makes a consistent enactment of the whole statute. This would be moreso if literal construction of a particular clause leads to manifestly absurd or anomalous results which could not have been intended by the Legislature.  [Para 14]"

Their claim is for selection and appointment to the post of Pharmacist, which is governed by the U.P. Pharmacists Service Rules, 1980. According to them, under Rule 15(2) of the 1980 Rules, all diploma holders were required to be appointed against the vacancies which became available in each recruitment year by first appointing those Pharmacists who had obtained their diplomas earlier. They claim that appointment to the post of Pharmacist should be made batchwise from each year and that the vacancies which had accrued, should be filled up by giving appointment to those Pharmacists according to the dates on which they had obtained their diplomas, irrespective of their merit. According to the Respondents, till those belonging to the earlier batches were not considered and given appointments in such vacancies, the diploma holders of the subsequent batches should not be given appointment, irrespective of their merit. The aforesaid controversy was triggered by an advertisement dated 12th November, 2007, whereby 766 vacancies were advertised for being filled up by diploma holders. The advertisement provided that the recruitment would be made in accordance with the U.P. Procedure for Direct Recruitment of Group 'C' Posts (Outside the Purview of Public Service Commission) Rules, 2000, as amended by the U.P. Procedure for Direct Recruitment of Group 'C' Posts (Outside the Purview of Public Service Commission) (First Amendment) Rules, 2003, and the relevant Service Rules in force with regard to educational qualifications and other conditions of service.\n\nHeld that, doctrine of past practice be applied. It is on account of a deliberate decision taken by the State Government that the private Respondents were left out of the zone of consideration for appointment as Pharmacists in order to accommodate those who had obtained their diplomas earlier. The decision taken by the State Government at that time to accommodate the diploma-holders in batches against their respective years can no doubt be discontinued at a later stage, but not to the disadvantage of those who had been deprived of an opportunity of being appointed by virtue of the same Rules. The same decision which was taken to deprive the private Respondents from being appointed, could not now be discarded, once again to their disadvantage to prevent them from being appointed, introducing the concept of merit selection at a later stage. The same may be introduced after the private Respondents and those similarly-situated persons have been accommodated. [Para 32,33]"

Such decision/direction of the State Government in the matter of policy, subsidy and public interest shall be final. Under Section 65 it is a prerogative of the State Government to grant any subsidy to any consumer or class of consumers in the tariff determined by the Commission under Section 62. It is apparent from the provisions contained in Sections 65 and 108 of Act of 2003 that to grant subsidy to any consumer or class of consumers is the prerogative of the State Government and such other direction issued in the public interest shall be binding upon the Commission. The State Government never intended to extend the benefit of the subsidy to HV-2 category consumers. It had not made any provision for extending subsidy to HV-2 consumers. The Commission in order dated 11.7.2006 itself has confined the tariff respite to LMV-2 and LMV-6 consumers. It was not open to the Commission to issue clarification dated 14-15/9/2006, as the matter of providing subsidy was clearly prerogative of the State Government under the provisions of Section 65 read with Section 108 of the Act of 2003 and Section 12 of Reforms Act, 1999 hence Commission could not have accepted on its own, or directed the State Government to release the subsidy to HV-2 consumers and that too unilaterally.\t\t         [Para 25,26]\n\nThe State Government thus, never intended the benefit to be given to big industries like HV-2 industries. In the circumstances, it was incumbent upon the Commission to consult the State Government before passing clarification order dated 14-15/9/2006 while applying its order dated 11.7.2006 to HV-2 consumers. It is a settled proposition that the assurance to form promissory estoppel must come from the person in authority having competence to extend it. The Commission and the Corporation had no jurisdiction in the matter of subsidy which is the domain of the State Government.\t\t         [Para 28,30]"

                ],
                "description": "Arbitration agreement - Doctrine of severability - Even if arbitral clause is invalid, the jurisdiction to decide that is of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nWhere a contract provides for arbitration of disputes which arise thereunder, does the invalidity, termination, nullification or suspension of the contract vitiate the arbitral obligations of the parties?  The question is posed on the assumption that when the agreement contains an obligation to arbitrate the disputes arising from it but the agreement is invalid or no longer in force, the obligation to arbitrate disappears with the agreement of which it is a part.  If the agreement was never entered at all, then the arbitral clause never came into force.  If the agreement was not validly entered into, then, prima facie, it is invalid as a whole, as must be all of its parts, including its arbitral clause.  If the agreement has been nullified or terminated, - or, arguably suspended it must presumably follow that the obligation to arbitrate disputes arising under the agreement is nullified, terminated or suspended.  Now if, in these various contingencies, there is no initial or sustained obligation to arbitrate under an agreement which either never came into force or is no longer in force, then the arbitral tribunal which may be or is constituted pursuant to the arbitral clause of the void or voided agreement has no standing to do anything.  It cannot pronounce or decide upon the validity of the agreement or upon the effect of the tribunal's establishment or upon its jurisdiction or upon the merits of the case because it cannot have a legal status which derives from a vacuum. This proposition of law has been overcomed by presumption and by practice.  It has been overcomed by necessity.  It has been overcomed by the essence of the arbitral process.  If it is inherent in the arbitral process that a tribunal is the judge of its own jurisdiction, that it has competence de la competence, it is no less inherent in that process that an arbitral tribunal shall have the competence to pass upon disputes arising out of the agreement which is the immediate source of the tribunal's creation even where those disputes engage the initial or continuing validity of that agreement.  This essential doctrine of modern arbitration is called that of the severability, separability or autonomy of the arbitration agreement.  The rational of the doctrine of the severability of the arbitration agreement has four foundations as set out by Justice S.M. Schwebel.  Firstly, when two parties enter into a contract or a treaty providing for arbitration of disputes arising thereunder, and do so as they typically do in comprehensive terms - \"any dispute arising out of or relating to the agreement\" they intend to require arbitration of any dispute not otherwise settled, including disputes over the validity of the contract or treaty, then the will of the parties should be given effect to.  Secondly, if one party could deny arbitration to the other party by the allegation that the agreement lacked initial or continuing validity, if by such an allegation it could deprive an arbitral tribunal of the competence to rule upon that allegation, upon its constitution and jurisdiction and upon the merits of the dispute, then it would always be open to a party to an agreement containing an arbitration clause to vitiate its arbitral obligation by the simple expedient of declaring the agreement void.  The intention of the parties and the requirements of effective arbitration combine to give rise to the concept of severability.  Thirdly, in reality, or, if not in reality, then in the contemplation of the law and as a matter of legal presumption, the parties to an agreement containing an arbitration clause conclude not one agreement but two; first, the substantive or principal agreement, which provides for a certain course of action; second, an additional, separable agreement which provides for arbitration of disputes arising out of the principal agreement.  Even if it be argued, or even if it be authoritatively decided, that the principal agreement is invalid, or voided, nullified, terminated, or suspended, nevertheless the arbitral agreement is separable and separated, and, so separated, survives to furnish a viable basis for the arbitration tribunal to rule upon such agreements or arrive at those or other determinations.  Thus when the parties to an agreement containing an arbitration clause, enter into that agreement, they conclude not one but two agreements, the arbitral twin of which survives any birth defect or acquired disability of the principal agreement.  Fourthly, the consideration which militates in favour of the rule of the severability of the arbitral clause because, if severability were not the rule, the courts would, contrary to the norm, be drawn into passing upon the substance of the dispute submitted to arbitration.\t [Para 8]\n\nBoth under English Law as well as Indian law, there is no room for doubt about the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction to the exclusion of the judicial authority in India and Civil Courts of England.  The object and purpose has been earlier set out namely to facilitate International Commercial Arbitration to avoid multiplicity of proceedings and to allow one tribunal to decide all issues between the parties and further to direct the parties to proceed before the forum of their choice.  Therefore, reading Section 8 and 16 of the Indian Arbitration Act together with Section 7,9 and 30 of the English Arbitration Act, it is clear that all disputes can be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal.  The fact however, remains that if the parties acquiesce in the proceeding by not moving under Section 8 or Section 45 or section 54, the jurisdiction of the civil court will not be ousted.  At the same time the issue whether the contract is void ab initio, including the arbitral clause, inoperative or incapable of being performed, can now be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal.

It clearly shows that, \"State Government\" is also authorized to accord sanction under this provision. It is clear that from 31st December 2008, sub-section (2) of Section 45 of UAP Act was inserted, thereby directing both, the Central and State Government, to create one independent Reviewing Authority and casting obligation on the Sanctioning Authority of Central Government, or, as the case may be, the State Government to consider the report of this Authority before according the sanction. Thus, it can be seen that both the Central Government as well as the State Government are empowered to appoint the said Reviewing Authority, thereby indicating that both the Central Government and State Government are competent to accord the sanction. Otherwise, there was no reason for directing the State Government also to appoint such independent Authority.\n\nThe absence of the words, the 'State Government', while defining the \"authority\" as well as while prescribing the \"time limit for making recommendation by the authority\" and \"time limit for sanction of prosecution\" in the Rules, cannot take away the authority of the State Government, given to it under the Section. In our considered opinion, such Rules, which are framed in exercise of delegated legislation, cannot take away the authority, which was vested in the State Government in view of Section 45(ii) of UAP Act. Hence, it cannot be accepted that from 31st December 2008 to 31st March 2009, State Government had no authority to accord sanction under Section 45(ii) of the UAP Act.  [Para 69,70]"

Act is that if a landlord wants to bring a suit to eject his tenant, he has to apply to the District Magistrate for permission to do so. The District Magistrate may grant or refuse to grant such permission. After the District Magistrate makes an order on the landlord's application, the party aggrieved by the order can apply in revision to the Commissioner within 30 days; and the Commissioner, in exercise of his revisional jurisdiction, has to deal with the revision application under S.3(3). If he is satisfied that the District Magistrate has acted illegally or with material irregularity, or has wrongly refused to act, he can make an appropriate order; and the order thus made by him is final under sub-s. (4), subject to any order that the State Government may pass under S.7-F of the Act. Section 16 in terms provides that the order made under this Act to which the said section applies shall not be called in question in any Court. This is an express provision excluding the civil Courts' jurisdiction. Section 3 (4) does not expressly exclude the jurisdiction of the civil Courts, but, in the context, the inference that the civil Courts jurisdiction is intended to be excluded, appears to be inescapable. However, does not necessarily mean that the plea against the validity of the order passed by the District Magistrate, or the Commissioner, or the State Government, can never be raised in a civil Court. The bar created by the relevant provisions of the Act excluding the jurisdiction of the civil Courts cannot operate in cases where the plea raised before the civil Court goes to the root of the matter and would, if upheld, lead to the conclusion that the impugned order is a nullity. This position can be illustrated as, If an order granting permission to a landlord is passed by a District Magistrate of one District when the property in question is situated in another district outside his jurisdiction, a party would be entitled to urge before a civil Court that the permission purported to have been granted by the District Magistrate is wholly invalid and a nullity in law. Provisions contained in Ss.3(4) and 16 undoubtedly raise a bar against pleas which challenge the correctness or propriety of the orders in question. The merits of the order are concluded by the decision of the appropriate authorities under the Act and they cannot be agitated in a civil Court. But where a plea seeks to prove that the impugned order is a nullity in the true legal sense, that is a plea which does not come within the mischief of the bar created by Ss.3(4) and 16 of the Act.

It is, fallacious to assume that a party can move the Commissioner under S.3(3) in cases where the District Magistrate just refuses to make an order on the application made by the landlord for permission to bring a suit against the tenant. If a District Magistrate just does not deal with the application and passes no order on it, the party aggrieved may be justified in applying for an appropriate writ to the High Court or adopt some other suitable remedy in law; but a revision in such a case does not appear to be competent under S.3(3). Besides, the illegality or the irregularity to which S.3(3) refers need not necessarily be correlated with questions of jurisdiction. Therefore, in the instant High Court was not justified in introducing a limitation pertaining to questions of jurisdiction in determining the scope of the width of the revisional power conferred on the Commissioner by S.3(3). That is why it must be held that the High Court was in error in coming to the conclusion that the permission granted by the Commissioner in exercise of the powers conferred on him by S.3(3) is invalid in law. By a subsequent amendment of S.3(3), the Legislature has made it clear that its intention is to confer wide jurisdiction on the Commissioner. There is no doubt that the relevant provisions of the Act did not intend, even prior to the amendment of 1954, to limit the jurisdiction of the Commissioner only to cases where irregularity or illegality had been committed by the District Magistrate in granting or refusing to grant permission.
