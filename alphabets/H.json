                "description": "Kidnapping from lawful guardianship - Authority of lawful guardian - His authority would be valid against everybody except the natural guardian or other lawful guardian - He cannot initiate criminal proceedings u/s.361 of I.P.C. against natural guardian of the child.\n\nSection 6 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act provides that natural guardian of a Hindu minor in the case of a boy or an unmarried girl is father and after him the mother. However, it provides that custody of a minor who has not completed the age of 5 years shall ordinarily be with the mother. Difference between the natural guardianship and custody is well understood. Father of a Hindu minor is guardian though, mother may be in custody or she may be entitled to custody upto certain age. In the present case Vikas was aged about 12 years when the alleged incident occurred. Therefore, he was minor and as such in view of the provisions of Section 6 of Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, the petitioner, being father, was natural guardian of the boy. He was the lawful guardian of the child and he continued to be lawful guardian even when the boy was removed from Z. P. Primary School, Pargaon by taking transfer certificate by his mother. Explanation to Section 361, I.P.C. provides that the lawful guardian in the said Section includes any person lawfully entrusted with the care or custody of such minor. It may be said that when Vikas was admitted in S.O.S. Bal-Gram hostel, he was for the time being in custody of the Director of that Bal-gram hostel and in view of the explanation to Section 361, I.P.C. the said Director would be included within the definition of lawful guardian. As such said Director, while in lawful custody of the child, was also lawful guardian but his authority as lawful guardian would be valid against everybody except the natural guardian or lawful guardian. He could not challenge authority of the mother who had put the child in the school nor he could challenge the authority of the father who is natural guardian and as such the lawful guardian of the child. If anybody other than the petitioner No.1 would have enticed or taken away the child from the said hostel without consent of the Director, such person could be said to have committed offence of kidnapping from lawful guardian U/s.361 of I.P.C. However, this would not be applicable in case of lawful and natural guardian i.e. father.  [Para 6]"

As such, the sole consideration to be weighed by the Court is what would be good for the paramount welfare of the child and nothing else. The Court will also have to examine what prejudice would occasion to such welfare by not changing the custody which is in existence at the time of the filing such application. To consider these aspects, the Court takes into consideration several factors such as the child's immediate environment and surrounding emotional security provided by those who have their custody and what would be conducive for the child to try and grow and become a good human being. Whenever there are conflicting demands of the parents the Court does not look into such claim on legalistic basis but takes the decision considering the welfare of such child. \n\n2010 ALL SCR 357, 2001(2) ALL MR 237 (S.C.)

                "description": "Appointment of Guardian - Welfare of child of 11 years - Petitionerfather, a superrich, influential foreign national - Child born in India but having dual citizenship of Kenya and U.K. - Child in various personal interactions by Family Court, High Court and Supreme Court, found to be bright, self-confident and articulated - Had great clarity about his preferences and aspirations - Nationality, relevant aspect to be given due consideration - Educational opportunities which would be available to child is an aspect of great significance - Objection by mother that petitioner was being racist, not established - Allegation of marital infidelity against petitioner, not established - Pending criminal proceedings against petitioner for alleged dam outburst in his family farms, not valid ground to refuse custody of child to him - In view of facts it would be in best interest of child to transfer custody of child to his father i.e. petitioner - However, mother cannot be kept out of further growth, progress and company of her son - Thus, she would be provided with temporary custody of child for 50% of his annual vacations once a year either in New Delhi or Kenya - Custody of child handed over to father subject to obtaining mirror order from Kenyan Court to reflect directions given by Supreme Court. (Majority view - Per Indu Malhotra, J. (for herself and on behalf of Uday Umesh Lalit, J.)\n\nA reading of the plaint of the Guardianship petition shows that respondent father relies upon availability of his parents in Kenya to take care of the child and, on the other hand, stress on the physical condition of appellant\u2019s mother to look after the child. I find that the entire basis to seek appointment as guardian of the child is the availability of his parents in Kenya and the physical condition of appellant\u2019s mother. The entire basis is incorrect as in the presence of parents of the child, the grandparents are not the determining factor to appoint a guardian. The question of where does the welfare of the child lie thus narrows down to the mother who has stopped practicing law to nurture child as against the father who travels quite substantially every month. In the absence of the father, the child will be in the custody of nannies, maids and servants. The grandparents would not be able to take care of the growing needs of a young child. All things being equal, the presence of grandparents can tilt in balance but where a mother who is available 24/7 for guiding, caring and nurturing a growing child as against a father who needs to travel outside his normal place of stay frequently, I find that the mother is more suitable in whose hands the welfare of the child is secured. (Para 76)\n\nThe question required to be examined is whether this Court should permit the child to be out of its supervisory jurisdiction so as to be a mute spectator to the possibility of defiance of the order of this Court. I am of the opinion that welfare of the Child would be to stay in India with his mother who has brought up the child for last 11 years. The Child is intelligent but not mature enough to take decisions by himself. Even, the law recognizes that the child of less than 18 years is incapable of representing himself. Therefore, any opinion of the child is not determinative of the final custody of the child but this Court as parens patriae is duty bound to assess the entire situation to return a finding whether the welfare of the child will be with the mother with visitation rights to the father or custody with the father with visitation rights to the mother. If the child is moved to Kenya, there is no way that this Court can enforce the orders to get the child back to India, even if it so desires. (Para 124)"

If this question is answered in the affirmative, the section has to be struck down as unconstitutional as it undoubtedly violates gender-equality, one of the basic principles of our Constitution. The HMG Act came into force in 1956, i.e., six years after the Constitution. Did the Parliament intend to transgress the constitutional limits or ignore the fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution which essentially prohibits discrimination on grounds of sex ? In our opinion - No. It is well settled that if on construction a given statute will become unconstitutional, whereas on another construction, which may be open, the statue remains within the constitutional limits, the Court will prefer the latter on the ground that the Legislature is presumed to have acted in accordance with the Constitution and courts generally lean in favour of the constitutionality of the statutory provisions.  [Para 9]\n\nSection 6(a) is capable of such construction as would retain it within the Constitutional limits. The word 'after' need not necessarily mean 'after the lifetime'. In the context in which it appears in Section 6(a) (supra), it means 'in the absence of', the word 'absence' therein referring to the father's absence from the care of the minor's property or person for any reason whatever. If the father is wholly indifferent to the matters of the minor even if he is living with the mother or if by virtue of mutual understanding between the father and the mother, the latter is put exclusively in charge of the minor, or if the father is physically unable to take care of the minor either because of his staying away from the place where the mother and the minor are living or because of his physical or mental incapacity, in all such like situations, the father can be considered to be absent and the mother being a recognised natural guardian, can act validly on behalf of the minor as the guardian. Such an interpretation will be the natural outcome of harmonious construction of S. 4 and S.6 of HMG Act, without causing any violence to the language of S. 6(a).  [Para 10]"

However, it specifically excludes a minor's undivided interest in joint family property.  Thus, the natural guardian father and, thereafter, the mother cannot be considered as natural guardian in respect of his undivided interest in joint family property.  Section 8 lays down the powers of natural guardian.  Since section 6 excludes the minor's undivided interest in the joint family property, section 8 also, would not be applicable to the minor's share in the undivided interest in the joint family property.  Thus, the provisions of obtaining prior permission by the natural guardian as envisaged under section 8 sub-clause (2) would not arise in respect of a minor's undivided interest in the joint family property.  Section 12 of the Act carves out an exception in respect of a minor's undivided interest in the joint family property when it states that the guardian is not to be appointed in respect of his undivided interest in joint family property.  It further states that if a minor has an adult member and the property is under the management of the joint family property, no guardian should be appointed for the minor.  Thus, an exception is carved out in respect of minor's interest in an undivided joint family property.  Thus in view of the said provision an adult member can sell the minor's share if it is for legal necessity.\t [Para 12]"

In this tussle, we have to decide who would be more suited to have custody of the child. The High Court appears to have taken the correct approach in a matter like this. Although, on first impression, it would appear that the interests of the minor child would best be served if she is allowed to remain with the appellant, the interim ex parte order passed by U.K. Court cannot be lost sight of. Moreover except for insisting that the minor be returned to its jurisdiction, the English Court did not intend to separate the child from the appellant, until a final decision was taken with regard to the custody of the child. The ultimate decision in that regard has to be left to the English Courts having regard to the nationality of the child and the fact that both the parents had worked for gain in the U.K. and had also acquired permanent resident status in the U.K. The High Court has taken note of the fact that the English Court has not directed that the custody of the child should be handed over to the respondent father but that the child should be returned to the jurisdiction of the Courts in the U.K. which would then proceed to determine as to who would be best suited to have the custody of the child. The approach of the High Court takes into consideration both the questions relating to the Comity of Courts as well as interest of the minor child, which, no doubt, is one of the most important considerations in matters relating go custody of a minor child. It has been rightly observed by the High Court that it was the English Courts which had the most intimate contact with the issue in question to decide the same. Hence, the High Court did not commit any error in relying on the doctrine of Comity of Courts since the question of what is in the interest of the minor still has to be considered by the U.K. Court and the interim order passed in the proceedings initiated by the 'Respondent is only of an interim nature with a view to return the child to the jurisdiction of the said Court.

                "description": "Custody of minor child - Considerations involved - Paramount consideration is \"welfare of the child\" and not the rights of parents.\n\nThe principles in relation to the custody of a minor child are well settled. In determining the question as to who should be given custody of a minor child, the paramount consideration is the 'welfare of the child' and not rights of the parents under a statute for the time being in force. Merely because there is no defect in fathers' personal care and his attachment for his children-which every normal parent has, he would not be granted custody. Simply because the father loves his children and is not shown to be otherwise undesirable does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that the welfare of the children would be better promoted by granting their custody to him. Children are not mere chattels nor are they toys for their parents. Absolute right of parents over the destinies and the lives of their children, in the modern changed social conditions must yield to the considerations of their welfare as human beings so that they may grow up in a normal balanced manner to be useful members of the society and the guardian court in case of a dispute between the mother and the father, is expected to strike a just and proper balance between the requirements of welfare of the minor children and the rights of their respective parents over them. When the court is confronted with conflicting demands made by the parents, each time it has to justify the demands. The Court has not only to look at the issue on legalistic basis, in such matters human angles are relevant for deciding those issues. The court then does not give emphasis on what the parties say, it has to exercise a jurisdiction which is aimed at the welfare of the minor.  \t\t\t\t\t [Para 35,40,42]\n\nThe word 'welfare' used in Section 13 of the Act has to be construed literally and must be taken in its widest sense. The moral and ethical welfare of the child must also weigh with the Court as well as its physical well being. Though the provisions of the special statutes which govern the rights of the parents or guardians may be taken into consideration, there is nothing which can stand in the way of the Court exercising its parens patriae jurisdiction arising in such cases. The trump card in appellants' argument is that the child is living since long with the father. The argument is attractive. But the same overlooks a very significant factor. By flouting various orders, leading even to initiation of contempt proceedings, the appellant has managed to keep custody of the child. He can not be a beneficiary of his own wrongs. It is true that taking the child out of the father's custody may cause some problems, but that is bound to be neutralized.   [Para 43,44,45]"

It is not possible to the Court to accept any such allegation without proof. In the case in hand, there is no proof whatsoever except a bare allegation. It is not possible, therefore, for the Court to accept the husband's contention of unchastity against the wife-respondent. The hitch placed by sub-clause (3)  of Section 18 of the Act, cannot,  therefore, obstruct the grant of maintenance to the wife. It is for the husband to prove that the wife is unchaste because it is he, who levels the allegations and in accordance with Section 101 of the Evidence Act, it is on him to prove the same. It is no doubt true that it is difficult to prove unchastity but it is also true that it is easy to level such allegations.   [Para 8,9]"

Under Section 6(c) it lays down that in the case of a married girl, the husband would be a natural guardian. So this Act in a way recognizes the marriages of minor girls. The Act deals with minors and mentions the husband as a guardian of a married girl. This itself conveys the intention of the legislature that for a married minor girl, guardian would be the husband. There cannot be any guardian for a major under the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956. Therefore the only meaning which has to be given to Section 6(c) is that if a minor girl is married, her natural guardian is the husband.  [Para 11]"

The child is, at present, 9 years of age and on advent of puberty. This is the age in which she requires more care and attention of the mother. Mother, at this age of the child, deserves to continue to keep the custody of the female child. She is reported to have given up her service and now leading life of a house-wife. The progress report of child indicates that she is very good at studies and has a bright educational career.\n\n2. It is reported that the wife is presently on the family way. The prospect of arrival of the second child in the family of the wife is another circumstance which would be in favour of the present child.\n\n3.  The petitioner lives alone with his father. There are no female members living jointly with him although he may have female relations in the city but that would not ensure constant company, care and attention to the female child.\n\n4. The petitioner/natural father is a busy Stock Broker allegedly carrying on his business with aid of on-line computer but it cannot be said that in the course of his business, he has not to remain out of residence for attending  his office and other business engagements.\n\n5. The apprehension expressed against the second husband that he might poison the mind of the child and create ill-will towards natural father is not borne out from the evidence on record. On the contrary, the second husband in his deposition has made statements evincing a very co-operative and humane attitude on his part towards the problem of the estranged couple and the child.\t\n\nThe visitation rights given to the natural father, in the present circumstances, also do not require any modification because with the passage of time, the growing child should eagerly wait for the company of his father as a happy and enjoyable moment rather than treat it as a part of empty ritual or duty. To make visitation rights of natural father effective and meaningful for proper growth of the child, active cooperation of both the parents and her step father is expected and it would not be found wanting from any one of them. Since the mother of the child is married to a famous cricketer, as and when she leaves the country on tour with her husband during school days or vacation period of the child without taking the child with her, instead of leaving the child to the care and custody of some other member of the family, the custody of the child during her absence from her home shall be given to the natural father.

Indubitably the provisions of law pertaining to the custody of a child contained in either the Guardians and Wards Act, 1890 (Section 17) or the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 (Section 13) also hold out the welfare of the child as a predominant consideration.  In fact, no statute, on the subject, can ignore, eschew or obliterate the vital factor of the welfare of the minor.  The question of welfare of the minor child has again to be considered in the background of the relevant facts and circumstances.  Each case has to be decided on its own facts and other decided cases can hardly serve as binding precedents insofar as the factual aspects of the case are concerned.  It is, no doubt, true that father is presumed by the statutes to be better suited to look after the welfare of the child, being normally the working member and head of the family, yet in each case the Court has to see primarily to the welfare of the child in determining the question of his or her custody.  Better financial resources of either of the parents or their love for the child may be one of the relevant considerations but cannot be the sole determining factor for the custody of the child.  It is here that a heavy duty is cast on the Court to exercise its judicial discretion judiciously in the background of all the relevant facts and circumstances, bearing in mind the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 14]"

The controlling consideration governing the custody of the minor is the welfare and well-being of the child concerned and not the right of their parents.\n\n(ii)\tThe discretion vested in the Court is, as is the case with all judicial discretions, to be exercised judiciously in the background of all relevant facts and circumstances. Each case has to be decided on its own facts and other cases can hardly serve as binding precedents.\n\n(iii)\tThe father's fitness has to be considered, determined and weighed predominantly in terms of the welfare of his minor children in the context of all the relevant circumstances. If the custody of the father cannot promote their welfare equally or better than the custody of the mother, then he cannot claim indefeasible right to their custody merely because there is no defect in his personal character and he has attachment for his children - which every normal parent has. In short, the father's fitness cannot override considerations of the welfare of the minor children.\n\n(iv)\tMerely because the father loves his children and is not shown to be otherwise undesirable cannot necessarily lead to the conclusion that the welfare of the children would be better promoted by granting their custody to him as against the wife who may also equally be affectionate towards her children and otherwise equally free from blemish.\n\n(v)\tSection 6 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act constitutes the father as the natural guardian of a minor. But that provision cannot supersede paramount consideration as to what is conducive to the welfare of the minor.\n\n(vi)\tThe father's right to custody of the minor children is neither an absolute nor an indefeasible one. The welfare of the child should be the paramount consideration. The mother can also be given custody of the minors, if their welfare or interest should require it, even if the father is otherwise fit to act as guardian.\n\n(vii)\tFemale child on the advent of puberty primarily requires mother's care and attention. Absence of female company in the house of the father is relevant factor.\n\n(viii)\tWhere the child is not in a position to express any intelligent preference between his/her parents, mature thinking is necessary to decide as to what will enure to his/her benefit welfare.\n\n(ix)\tIn case of dispute between the mother and the father regarding custody of their child, the paramount consideration is welfare of the child and not the legal rights of either of the parties. The Court, therefore, should examine what is in the best interest of the child, whether her welfare would be better looked after if she is given in the custody of either the father or the mother. Such cases cannot be decided solely by interpreting legal provisions.\n\n(x)\tA court while dealing with the custody cases, is neither bound by statutes nor by strict rules of evidence or procedure nor by precedents. In selecting proper guardian of a minor, the paramount consideration should be the welfare and well-being of the child.\n\n(xi)\tIn selecting a guardian, the court is expected to give due weight to the child's ordinary comfort, contentment, health, education, intellectual development and favourable surroundings. But over and above, physical comforts, moral and ethical value cannot be ignored. They are equally important, essential and indispensable considerations. 2000(3) ALL MR (S.C.) 667, 2005 ALL MR (Cri) 1822 (S.C.) & 2001(2) ALL MR 237 (S.C.) - Ref. to.\t [Para 11]"

In the\nfirst instance, it is to ensure that the child grows and develops in the best environment. The\nbest interest of the child has been placed at the vanguard of family/custody disputes according\nthe optimal growth and development of the child primacy over other considerations. The\nchild is often left to grapple with the breakdown of an adult institution. While the parents aim\nto ensure that the child is least affected by the outcome, the inevitability of the uncertainty\nthat follows regarding the child's growth lingers on till the new routine sinks in. The effect\nof separation of spouses, on children, psychologically, emotionally and even to some extent\nphysically, spans from negligible to serious, which could be insignificant to noticeably critical.\nIt could also have effects that are more immediate and transitory to long lasting thereby\nhaving a significantly negative repercussion in the advancement of the child. While these\neffects don't apply to every child of a separated or divorced couple, nor has any child\nexperienced all these effects, the deleterious risk of maladjustment remains the objective of\nthe parents to evade and the court's intent to circumvent. This right of the child is also based\non individual dignity.\nSecond justification behind the 'welfare' principle is the public interest that stands\nserved with the optimal growth of the children. It is well recognised that children are the\nsupreme asset of the nation. Rightful place of the child in the sizeable fabric has been\nrecognised in many international covenants, which are adopted in this country as well.\nChild-centric human rights jurisprudence that has been evolved over a period of time is\nfounded on the principle that public good demands proper growth of the children, who are\nthe future of the nation. 2009(1) ALL MR 925 (S.C.), (1997) 10 SCC 549 Ref. to.

Section 8 Subsection (3) says while disposing of immovable property of a minor by the natural guardian, any contravention of Sub-section (1) of Sub-section(2) is voidable at the instance of the minor or any person claiming under him. Question arises whether any transfer if made by a person other than the natural guardian whether is voidable or a void transaction. In the present case the brother who transferred the property on behalf of the minor without permission of the Court is unauthorized transfer. Such an unauthorized transfer is voidable if it is done at the instance of the natural guardian but in other cases the transaction if so made should be considered a void one because the Act does not make it voidable. The brother who has transferred the property is in the position of a de facto guardian of a Hindu minor which is materially different from that of natural guardian or a guardian appointed by the Court. Therefore, this transfer on behalf of the minor is an unauthorized transfer and is void. \t\t\t [Para 5]\n\n\tAccording to the intent of the legislature after commencement of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, 1956 no person is entitled to dispose of or deal with the property of a Hindu minor merely on the ground of his/her being the de facto guardian representing the minor. Alienation done by a de facto guardian is void and the alienee is in the position of a trespasser who has no right in the property. The object of Section 11 is to prevent any de facto guardian from dealing with the property of a minor and if any other interpretation is made the same will frustrate the object of Section 11.\n\n\tAs the alienation made by the de facto guardian is invalid and not binding on the minor, alienee cannot justify it on the ground that the minor subsequently did not challenge the transfer which is void ab initio and does not get regularized for any eventuality in future. The brother who transferred the property is also not a natural guardian and as a result question whether such sale was made under duress or for legal necessity of the minor, can also not be considered. \t [Para 8]"

The District Court clearly exceeded its jurisdiction in entering into the question whether the oral mortgage was valid or invalid and whether original defendant No.1 had right to induct tenant without considering the fact that as stated in plaint itself, said defendant No.1, was lawfully put in possession of the suit property. It may be that Defendant No.1 may not have rights of mortgagee though recognized by the plaintiffs, but he was definitely in permissive possession of the property. 2007(2) ALL MR 288 - Foll. \t\t\t\t [Para 25,27,30,31]"

They claimed possession from defendant on the ground that the petitioners were landlords and defendant was the tenant. The possession was claimed on the ground of failure to pay rent. Having failed to secure possession, Petitioners filed the suit under Hyderabad Atiyat Inquiries Act, 1952. In the earlier proceedings, Petitioners did not plead non applicability of Hyderabad Tenancy Act. In the earlier proceedings, the petitioners did not claim that the lands were service Inam lands. In the earlier proceedings, Petitioners did not plead that defendant was not entitled to claim tenancy rights as the lands in question were service Inam lands. In the earlier proceedings defendant was admitted to be a tenant. Under the circumstances, it was not open to the Petitioners to plead that the lands in question were service Inam lands and, therefore, defendant was not entitled to the status of being a tenant. The Atiyat Deputy Collector erred, therefore, in coming to the conclusion that defendant was not a tenant.  [Para 6]\n\nOn scrutiny of the provisions of the Hyderabad Tenancy Act, the Hyderabad Abolition of Inam Act and Hyderabad Atiyat Inquiries Act, it is clear that there is no bar on creation of tenancy by the Inamdar under the three enactments. On the contrary, the Hyderabad Tenancy Act divides the tenants into protected tenants and ordinary tenants. Tenants falling under sections 34, 37 or 37-A are protected tenants while others are ordinary tenants. In the circumstances, the Circular dated 9/8/1955 seeks to protect the tenants who are cultivating Inam Lands. Hence, although the Circular does not confer status of tenant on a person, still, in cases where the cultivator is in possession for last several years, security of tenor is granted to such cultivator on his payment of rent. In the circumstances, it could not be contended by the Petitioners that the Circular overrides section 102A of the Hyderabad Tenancy Act. Defendant as an ordinary tenant, was certainly entitled to be protected from eviction. Hence, in such cases, the Circular is squarely applicable.  [Para 6]"

Said steps are required to be taken by the Collector. However, in the instant case, the order passed by the Deputy Collector is passed in appeal filed by the appellant where the petitioner who is appellant therein, has questioned the correctness of the order of the Tahsildar directing the Circle Inspector to take possession of the suit land and retain the same with the Government. Therefore, the said order of the Tahsildar was confined to the provisions of Section 98-C of the said Act. However, the Deputy Collector in appeal filed by the petitioner travelled beyond the pleadings and prayers in the appeal and granted something which was not even asked by the respondent No.1 in the said proceedings. Therefore, though the Counsel for respondent No.1 strenuously contended that, even his application under section 98A of the said Act has been allowed and decided by the Deputy Collector on 23-10-2009, said contention is required to be rejected since the Deputy Collector has only adjudicated and decided the Appeal No. TNC-1/2009 filed by the petitioner herein.\n\nThough the Counsel for respondent No.1 submits that, his application under Section 98-A of the said Act is not pending before the Deputy Collector, in that regard it has to be observed that, if the application is not pending and decided under section 98 of the said Act, it was open for respondent No. 1 to bring on record under which proceedings the said application is adjudicated and decided by the Deputy Collector separately, by giving opportunity to the petitioner to put forth his case. Nothing has been placed on record by respondent No.1 alongwith affidavit in reply to show that, his application under section 98A of the said Act has been adjudicated and decided by the Deputy Collector, who is competent to hear and decide the said application and the decision is rendered thereupon by directing the authorities to give possession to respondent No.1 herein. Therefore, what is challenged in this writ petition is the order of the Deputy Collector dated 23-10-2009 in Appeal No. TNC-01/2009 which is confirmed by the Maharashtra Revenue Tribunal.\n\nOn careful perusal of the judgment and order of the Maharashtra Revenue Tribunal, in para-10 the Maharashtra Revenue Tribunal has mechanically confirmed the order passed by the Tahsildar and also the order passed by the Deputy Collector, without appreciating the contention of the petitioner that the order of the Deputy Collector was in excess of his jurisdiction.\n\nTherefore, for the reasons aforesaid, Court allowed this writ petition. In the result, the judgment and order passed by the Tahsildar, Kalamnuri dated 10-11-2008 in Case No. 2008/Land/KV, confirmed by the Deputy Collector in Appeal No. TNC-1/2009 and further confirmed by the Maharashtra Revenue Tribunal in Case No.43-B-2009-H is quashed and set aside.

At that time the petitioner has to come forward and state that he has a right to purchase the said land and should offer the price for the said share. This is being analysed only for the purposes that, whether the plaintiff is entitled to purchase the said land on the basis of the pre-emption and if at all he is entitled to purchase on the basis of pre-emption, whether his holding exceeds as per the provisions of Section 47 on that day is a question to be considered, because if it is found that the co-owner also showed a willingness to sell this land to the plaintiff and actually transaction is completed, still if on that day it is found that the plaintiff's holding is more than three times as provided under section 47, the sale becomes invalid in view of the provisions of Section 47. Not only that but even if the defendant is not ready to sell the property to the plaintiff, however, the plaintiff's right by way of an entitlement to the purchase has to be considered in the light of Section 47 and if it is found that the plaintiff's holding exceeds three times of the family holding, even though the right of pre-emption is recognised, it cannot be enforced because of the Section 47 of the Act.

Section 38-E with which this Court is concerned, vide its Explanation provides a remedy to protected tenant if he is not in possession of the land on the date of notification and his dispossession is otherwise then in manner and by order of Tahsildar as provided in Section 32. Explanation itself contemplates that such a tenant shall be deemed to have been holding the land on the date of notification and the Tahsildar has been given powers to pass appropriate orders for restoring actual possession. Thus, again this deeming fiction for possession is for the purposes of operation of main clause 38-E which statutorily transfers ownership to that tenant. Thus, when landlord has taken or procured both lands contrary to the provisions of Section 32, and therefore, the protected tenant is found not in possession on the date of notification, legi has taken precaution to confer the statutory ownership upon him and for restoration of his physical possession. Here, on 01.02.1957, father of petitioner was very much alive and was in cultivating possession, therefore, this Explanation does not provide any remedy to him. Section 46 is also a provision in 1950 Act which enables tenant to approach the Tahsildar for recovery of possession but then that operates only when the landlord who after termination of tenancy under Section 44 or Section 44-A, does not within one year of resumption of possession, start personal cultivation. That remedy therefore is again not available to the present petitioner.  [Para 17]"

It does not contemplate filing of any application by any party to initiate proceedings under Section 98. Thus, it only casts obligation on the Collector to evict such unauthorised or wrongful occupant. The fact of such wrongful or unauthorised occupation may come to knowledge of Collector belatedly through different sources & in various situations. It is therefore obvious that Legislature has only conferred the powers upon the authority to act in furtherance of provisions and for the purposes of 1950 Act to see that its aims and objections are achieved & preserved. No period of limitation therefore has been deliberately prescribed as such fact of unauthorised occupation or wrongful possession may also be deliberately suppressed by the parties from the Collector by adopting various means and measures. When the legislature has vested title in protected tenant on tiller's day against the wishes of land-holder, it is obvious that its design to advance the said cause, to protect or preserve that title from unscrupulous influences whenever it comes across such instances can not be allowed to be defeated by such technical pleas.

Irrespective of the source from where the Judges are drawn, they must be paid the same pension just as they have been paid same salaries and allowances and perks as serving Judges. Only practicing Advocates who have attained eminence are invited to accept Judgeship of the High Court. Because of the status of the office of High Court Judge, the responsibilities and duties attached to the office, hardly any advocate of distinction declines the offer. Though it may be a great financial sacrifice to a successful lawyer to accept Judgeship, it is the desire to serve the society and the high prestige attached to the office and the respect the office commands that propel a successful lawyer to accept Judgeship. The experience and knowledge gained by a successful lawyer at the Bar can never be considered to be less important from any point of view vis-a-vis the experience gained by a judicial officer. If the service of a judicial officer is counted for fixation of pension, there is no valid reason as to why the experience at Bar cannot be treated as equivalent for the same purpose. The fixation of higher pension to the Judges drawn from the Subordinate Judiciary who have served for shorter period in contradistinction to Judges drawn from the Bar who have served for longer period with less pension is highly discriminatory and breach of Article 14 of the Constitution. The classification itself is unreasonable without any legally acceptable nexus with the object sought to be achieved. In most of the States, the Judgeship of the High Court is offered to advocates who are in the age group of 50-55 years, since pre-eminence at the Bar is achieved normally at that age. After remaining at the top for a few years, a successful lawyer may show inclination to accept Judgeship, since that is the culmination of the desire and objective of most of the lawyers. When persons holding constitutional office retire from service, making discrimination in the fixation of their pensions depending upon the source from which they were appointed is in breach of Articles 14 and 16(1) of the Constitution. One rank one pension must be the norm in respect of a Constitutional Office.\t\t\t\t    [Para 24,25,27]"

                "description": "Adoption of child - Scope and applicability of Juvenile Justice Act - Juvenile Justice Act is a special enactment dealing with children in conflict with law and children in need of care and protection - Religious identity of child or of parents who adopt is not a pre-condition to applicability of the law - Law is secular and deals with conditions of social destitution which cut across religious identities.\n\nThe Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 and the Juvenile Justice Act, 2000 must be harmoniously construed. The Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 deals with conditions requisite for adoption by Hindus. The Juvenile Justice Act of 2000 is a special enactment dealing with children in conflict with law and children in need of care and protection. While enacting the Juvenile Justice Act, 2000 the legislature has taken care to ensure that its provisions are secular in character and that the benefit of adoption is not restricted to any religious or social group. The focus of the legislation is on the condition of the child taken in adoption. If the child is orphaned, abandoned or surrendered, that condition is what triggers the beneficial provisions for adoption. The legislation seeks to ensure social integration of such children and adoption is one method to achieve that object. The religious identity of the child or of the parents who adopt is not a precondition to the applicability of the law. The law is secular and deals with conditions of social destitution which cut across religious identities. The legislature in its wisdom clarified in sub-section (6) of Section 41 that the Court may allow a child to be given in adoption to parents to adopt a child of the same sex irrespective of the number of living biological sons or daughters. This provision is intended to facilitate the rehabilitation of orphaned, abandoned or surrendered children. The condition must apply to all persons irrespective of religious affiliation who seek to adopt children of that description. The object of rehabilitation and providing for social reintegration to orphaned, abandoned or surrendered children is a matter of high legislative policy. It is in effectuation of that policy that the legislature has stipulated that adoption of such a child must proceed irrespective of the marital status of a person taking in adoption and irrespective of the number of living biological children of the parents seeking adoption. Consequently, where the child which is sought to be adopted falls within the description of an orphaned, abandoned or surrendered child within the meaning of sub-section (2) of Section 41 or a child in need of care and protection under clause (d) of Section 2, the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 must prevail. In such a case the embargo that is imposed on adopting a child of the same sex by a Hindu under clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 11 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 must give way to the salutary provisions made by the Juvenile Justice Act. Where, however, the child is not of a description falling under the purview of Chapter IV of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2000, a Hindu desirous of adopting a child continues to be under the embargo imposed by clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 11 of the Act of 1956. If the two pieces of legislation, both of which are enacted by Parliament are harmoniously construed, there is no conflict of interpretation.  [Para 20]"

We have seen that defendant is admittedly the father of the three daughters whom the plaintiff got married. Every father is under an obligation to maintain his daughters and even to get them married. The obligation to maintain the daughter and get her married is said to be personal in character and arises from the very existence of the relationship. Under the Hindu Law, a daughter is entitled to be maintained out of estate of her father even after the death of the father. In the instant case, the father is alive and admittedly has source of income from salary and agriculture land. A father who lives separately from his wife, therefore, cannot escape the liability to maintain his daughters. Here, it would be necessary to look into the definition of the word maintenance as given in the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956. The word has been defined as follows -\n\n\"maintenance\" includes -\n\n(i)\tin all cases, provision for food, clothing, residence, education and medical attendance and treatment;\n\n(ii)\tin the case of an unmarried daughter, also the reasonable expenses of and incidental to her marriage;\n\nThe definition is inclusive. It includes the provision of the reasonable expenses of and incidental to marriage of daughter. It is thus clear that father, who has deserted his wife and daughters is also liable to make a provisions of reasonable expenses for the marriage of daughters. Thus, not under the old Hindu Law but under the codified Hindu Law also the father is bound to make such a provision as can be seen from the definition of word maintenance.\n\nIn the instant case, the plaintiff who is the mother of daughters filed the suit. She has made a specific plea that she had incurred loans and had spent for the marriages of the daughters. The defendant admitted during the course of his examination before the court that his wife did spend for the marriages of his daughters. The Law envisages that a father is bound to make provision for the marriage expenses of the daughters as a part of maintenance. Therefore, if wife has spent for the performance of the marriage of the daughter, the husband would certainly be liable to reimburse the wife. He cannot escape his liability in any case.

In pending proceedings even at the instance of the second wife in a void bigamous marriage, the court is empowered to make an attempt for re-conciliation, to pass necessary orders with regard to the custody of children and disposal of the property exchanged at the time of marriage.  The court has also power in such proceedings to make an order of permanent alimony or maintenance under Section 25 of the Act.  The Act confers wide powers on the matrimonial Court so as to regulate matrimonial relationship between the parties and such powers are to be exercised by the court even in a case of alleged or proved bigamous marriage.  In enacting Section 24 a special provision is made for ordering interim maintenance and the expenses of litigation to be provided for the contesting husband or wife if he or she had no independent sufficient income.  Therefore, there is no reason why the words \"wife\" or \"husband\" used in Section 24 should not be interpreted so as to include a man and woman who have gone through a ceremony of a Hindu marriage which would have been valid but for the provisions of Section 11 read with clause (i) of Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act.  These words have been used as convenient terms to refer the parties who have gone through a ceremony of marriage whether or not that marriage is valid or subsisting, just as the word \"marriage\" has been used in the Act to include a purported marriage which is void ab initio.

In the present appeal, we are concerned with plaintiff's title to the suit property. The plaintiff was adopted in 1964-65. However, adoption did not divest 1st defendant of the suit property which vested in her by succession on the death of her husband. It is for this reason that the plaintiff relied on Ex.P-1 contending that the said deed was a deed of adoption-cum-settlement. Transfer of title in favour of the plaintiff had no relevance with the adoption because mere adoption did not deprive defendant No.1 of her right to dispose of her own disposable property. In the present case, the High Court had erred in holding that the recital in Ex.P.1 was sufficient to constitute transfer of the title. That Ex.P-1 itself vested the suit property on the plaintiff. As held by the lower appellate Court, Ex.P-1 has not been stamped. It does not identify the suit property. It did not contain Valuation. In the circumstances, it did not convey any right, title or interest in favour of the plaintiff. The High Court has not gone into these aspects at all. There was no valid settlement. Consequently the lower appellate Court and the trial Court were right in dismissing the suit.   [Para 6]"

The word \"support\" has not been defined under the Hindu Marriage Act. We will have to only look at the definition as given in the dictionary or as understood in general parlance. However, we can draw inspiration from the word \"maintenance\" which has been defined under the provisions of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. Section 3(b)(i) of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act defines maintenance to be inclusive of provision for food, clothing, residence, education and medical attendance and treatment. The definition here is also not an extensive definition, but inclusive one and nevertheless specifically mentions about medical attendance and, treatment. The meaning attributed to the word \"maintenance\" and as defined under Section 3(b)(i) can be taken to be the meaning even under the word \"support\" used under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act.

An obligation which cannot be legally enforced cannot be recognized as legal obligation at all.  Section 19 is a complete scheme in itself which provides for an obligation and also its enforcement.  It creates a right in daughter-in-law with corresponding liability on father in law.  It specifies in what circumstances & to what extent the right accrues and when or how it is enforceable.  It is therefore not possible to read Section 19(1) independent of Section 19(2) of Act.  AIR 1977 Madras 372 and AIR 1981 AP 88 - Ref.to.  [Para 9,10]"

If the wife is directed to be paid maintenance despite the said decree, reluctance of the wife to join the husband would be further strengthened and she would be encouraged to stay away from the husband despite the decree passed by the Court. The decree for restitution of conjugal rights would be rendered inoperative and for such an act of the wife, the husband would be penalized to pay the maintenance to the wife, who does not subject to the decree passed by the Court. Such a direction would be incentive to frustrate the decree passed under Section 9 of the Act. If such a decree is passed at the instance of the wife and against the husband, the Court would be justified in directing the husband to pay maintenance to the wife till he resumes co-habitation with her or calls upon her to join him at the matrimonial home pursuant to the decree passed by the Court in her favour.

(1973), S.125 - Maintenance - Right of second wife - Second marriage during subsistence of first one is void ipso jure being in contravention of S.5(i) of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 - A woman entering into such Marriage is not a \"wife\" within the meaning of either Hindu Marriage Act or Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act or S.125 of Cr.P.C. - Hence cannot claim maintenance under any of these statutes.\n\nA marriage contravening S.5(i) of Hindu Marriage Act is void ipso jure and the woman entering into such a marriage is not a \"wife\" within the meaning of either Hindu Marriage Act or S.125 of Cr.P.C.  The expression \"wife\" used in both statutes means only a legally wedded wife.  The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act cannot be treated differently for the meaning to the expression \"wife\" used therein.  The expression must be given the meaning in which it is understood in law applicable to the parties.  Since the institution of Marriage and the very relationship of husband and wife originates from personal law applicable to the parties, there can be no escape from reference to personal law while understanding the expression \"husband\" and \"wife\" used in different statutes.  As far as Hindus are concerned, the law relating to Marriage amongst Hindus is codified by Hindu Marriage Act and therefore unless the marriage is valid under the provisions of Hindu Marriage Act the parties entering into such a Marriage cannot describe themselves as \"husband\" and \"wife\" for the purposes of application of different statutes or for deriving the benefits available under different statutes.\n\nAs regards the argument based on S.18(2)(d) of Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (which enables a wife to live separately and claim maintenance if her husband has any other wife living) is concerned, such a provision can obviously exist only in case of Marriages solemnized before Hindu Marriage Act came into operation.  Had the Hindu Marriage Act not laid down monogamy as a rule of law and that Hindu husband cannot marry another wife after the commencement of that Act, clause (d) could not have been included in S.18(2) of Hindu Adoption & Maintenance Act.  Further, a bigamous marriage contracted after coming into force of Hindu Marriage Act being null and void, question of having another wife cannot arise after the Hindu Marriage Act came into operation.  Therefore, it can be applicable only in cases where a husband has entered into two Marriages prior to coming into operation of Hindu Marriage Act.\n\nTherefore, the expression \"Hindu wife\" used in S.18 of Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, means legally wedded Hindu wife and no less. A second wife not being the legally wedded wife cannot resort to S.18 to claim maintenance.  AIR 1999 AP 19 - Rel. on.

Therefore, while interpreting these provisions, the Court shall have to keep in view the legal position obtaining before enactment of the 1956 Act, the object of the new legislation and apply the rule of purposive interpretation and if that is done, it would be reasonable to say that the consent of wife envisaged in the proviso to Section 7 should either be in writing or reflected by an affirmative/positive act voluntarily and willingly done by her. If the adoption by a Hindu male becomes subject matter of challenge before the Court, the party supporting the adoption has to adduce evidence to prove that the same was done with the consent of his wife. This can be done either by producing document evidencing her consent in writing or by leading evidence to show that wife had actively participated in the ceremonies of adoption with an affirmative mindset to support the action of the husband to take a son or a daughter in adoption. The presence of wife as a spectator in the assembly of people who gather at the place where the ceremonies of adoption are performed cannot be treated as her consent. In other words, the Court cannot presume the consent of wife simply because she was present at the time of adoption. The wife's silence or lack of protest on her part also cannot give rise to an inference that she had consented to the adoption.   [Para 20]"

                "description": "Application for maintenance - Applicant second wife of her husband - Second marriage null and void when solemnised on account of subsistence of the first marriage of husband - Divorce of first wife - Parties to second marriage continue to live as husband and wife even after divorce of first marriage - Second wife entitled to the status of a wife and consequently has a right to claim maintenance. Criminal P.C. (1973), S.125.\n\nIn the present case, the evidence adduced by the wife shows that although on the date of her marriage with the husband on 2-6-1978 the first marriage of the husband was subsisting, the first marriage of the husband had come to an end with the execution of Deed of Divorce dated 7-4-1980.  It was contended on behalf of the wife that since the husband has not led any evidence to establish the subsistence of his first marriage, her testimony as well as her tendering xerox copy of the divorce deed does neither conclusively establish the validity of the first marriage of the husband nor its dissolution.  Before the Family Court, no such issue was framed and there is no finding to that effect.  Moreover, the husband instead of rebutting the above contentions, has in fact chosen to make capital out of it.  Therefore, court proceeded on the footing that the first marriage of the husband was subsisting on 2-6-1978.  If the first marriage of the husband was subsisting on the date of the second marriage, then as per law and as per the judicial decisions of the Apex Court the second marriage is null and void.  But the question in the present case is, if the first marriage has come to an end by a Divorce deed dated 7-4-1980 and both the parties to the second marriage continue to live together as husband and wife after the dissolution of the first marriage, whether the second wife can be deprived of the status of a wife ? Even though the second marriage of the husband during the subsistence of the first marriage was null and void, on the dissolution of the first marriage, if the parties to the second marriage continued to live together as husband and wife, then there is no impediment in conferring the status of 'wife' to the second wife. In other words, even if the second marriage was null and void when solemnised on account of the subsistence of the first marriage of the husband, if the parties to the second marriage continue to live as husband and wife even after the divorce of the first marriage then the second wife would be entitled to the status of a wife and consequently has a right to claim maintenance.   [Para 16]\n\nWith the ever increasing matrimonial offences, time has come for the Parliament to have a fresh look and see whether the existing laws strike a balance in the matter of rights and obligations cast upon the husband and wife in preserving the sanctity of the sacred institution of marriage.  Luckily in the present case, the first marriage of the husband ended in a divorce, as a result whereof maintenance could be granted to the wife.  But in a given case, if the wife is an innocent victim and it is only after the marriage, she realises that the husband has cheated her by not disclosing the existence of a living spouse, should the wife be at the mercy of the husband and stay with him as a concubine ? Should there be no legislation granting some protection for her to live independently in a dignified way by seeking maintenance from the husband ? In a society where the marriage between a man and woman is considered to be sacred and supposed to last beyond the existence of the physical body and extend for generations, whether the existing legislations strike a balance in the matter of matrimonial offences committed by man or a woman?  It is for the legislature to consider and take appropriate measures.  AIR 1965 SC 1564 and AIR 1975 SC 83 - Referred to.\t [Para 18]"

[Para 16,22]\n\nThe entitlement of a Hindu wife to be maintained by her husband during her life time is the most important provision of S.18. The question whether the Court has jurisdiction to pass interim order can never be dependant on the possibility of the defences to the suit. What is more important is that the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 avowedly is for codifying the law relating to maintenance amongst Hindus.  It is extremely relevant to notice that the inclusive definition of \"maintenance\" states that \"maintenance\" includes (i) in all cases, provision for food, clothing, residence, education and medical attendance and treatment; and (ii) in the case of an unmarried daughter, also the reasonable expenses of and incident to her marriage. These aspects of maintenance clearly contemplate grant of the same when the same is needed. That the wife, if she succeeds, will be entitled to arrears is no consolation. For example, there may be urgent need of medical attendance and treatment which surely cannot await the decision of the suit after several years. For ought one knows, in the absence of proper medical attendance and treatment, the plaintiff may not survive to obtain the fruits of her decree by way of arrears of maintenance. The inclusive definition of maintenance is also a pointer to indicate that in the very nature of things, if the absolute right of maintenance granted by the Legislature to a Hindu wife is to be effective, then the Court must necessarily have the power to pass ad-interim and interim orders. Otherwise, the very purpose and object of the Act is likely to be defeated. Similar is the case in respect of section 20 which provides for maintenance of children and aged parents. Now if an unmarried daughter of a marriageable age requires reasonable expenses of and incidental to her marriage, surely she cannot be asked to wait until the conclusion of the trial. Taking into consideration the scheme of the Act and the definition of \"maintenance\", it is implicit that though there is no express provision in section 18 or for that matter in section 19 or 20, the power and jurisdiction to pass ad-interim and interim order can legitimately and justifiably read into those provisions. Otherwise, the very object of the Act is likely to be defeated.  [Para 10,16]\n\nIt cannot be said absence of express provision enabling the Court to pass interim orders cannot be read as prohibition to pass such orders. Not passing such an order is not only more disastrous but may defeat the entire object and purpose of the Act. The provisions of section 18(1) give absolute entitlement to a Hindu wife to be maintained by her husband during her life time. If this has to be ensured, urgent ad-interim and interim orders as required under the circumstances of the case will have to be passed.  [Para 21,23]"

However, since there is power in the Court to pass interim and ad-interim orders, whether there is existence of such conditions at such a stage cannot be determined finally and, ultimately, it will have to be determined on the prima facie view of the matter. At this stage of passing interim order what is required is only prima facie satisfaction of the Judge. In the very nature of things, while passing such ad-interim orders, the Judge has to take some ad hoc view of the matter and it is also settled law that the appellate Court will not interfere with the discreation used by the Judge in such matters.

Generally,there is a presumption that law prevails and when the claim of custom is against such general presumption,then, whoever sets up the plea of existence of any custom has to discharge the onus of proving it, with all itsrequisites to the satisfaction of the Court in a most clear and unambiguous manner. It should be noted that, there are many types of customs to name a few-generalcustoms, local customs and tribal customs etc. and the burden of proof for establishing a type of custom depend on the type and the extent of usage. It must be shown that the alleged custom has the characteristics of a genuine custom viz., that it is accepted willfully as having force of law, and is not a mere practice more or less common. The acts required for the establishment ofcustomary law ought to be plural, uniform and constant.Custom evolves by conduct, and it is therefore a mistake to measure its validity solely by the element of express sanction accorded by courts of law. The characteristic of the great majority of customs is that theyare essentially non-litigious in origin. They arise not from any conflict of rights adjusted, but from practicesprompted by the convenience of society. A judicial decision recognizing a custom may be relevant, but these are not indispensable for its establishment. When acustom is to be proved by judicial notice, the relevant test would be to see if the custom has been acted upon by acourt of superior or coordinate jurisdiction in the samejurisdiction to the extent that justifies the court, which is asked to apply it, in assuming that the persons or the class of persons concerned in that area look upon thesame as binding in relation to circumstances similar to those under consideration. \t [Para 13,14]"

By adoption of such a course, no purpose would be served. In other words, the amount of maintenance should not be punitive in nature. It should aid the wife to live in a similar style as she enjoyed in the matrimonial home. It should not expose the husband to unjustified contempt or other coercive proceedings. On the other hand the amount of maintenance should not be so low, as to make the order meaningless. Naturally, there can be no mathematical exactitude, in these matters. The Court has to take a general view, and try to fix an amount which would be by and large acceptable to both the husband and the wife.  [Para 10]"

The mother of the petitioner has only divorced his biological father and after remarriage he has become the step-son of his step-father, who cannot replace the biological father but the things would have been different had it been a case of adoption because as per Section 12 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956.\n\nPerusal of S.9 of 1956 Act it transpires that even if there is a divorce between biological parents of the petitioner, in the presence of the biological father, the step-father of the petitioner cannot give the petitioner in adoption with his biological mother. Even under Section 8 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956, the step-son is neither Class-I nor Class-II heir.\n\nThus, from the aforesaid discussion, it transpires that correction in the Birth Certificate in the Register of Births and Deaths of the adoptive parents can be made if it is proved to the satisfaction of the Registrar, that too in accordance with the other terms and conditions mentioned in Section 15 of the Act but the entry of a step-father, replacing the name of the biological father in the Birth Certificate maintained under the Act, cannot be made. \t [Para 8,9,13,14]"

                "description": "Just compensation - Upon death of Govt. employee in State of Haryana - Question as to whether compensation received by dependents of deceased under Rule 2006 from State to be deducted - Discussed.\n\n\t\tRule 5 of Haryana Compassionate Assistance to Dependents of Deceased Government Employees Rules, 2006 broadly deals with two aspects. Firstly, to compensate the dependents of the deceased Government employee by granting ex-gratia financial assistance on compassionate grounds for the loss of pay and other allowances for a specified period. The second part of Rule 5 is to compensate the dependents of the deceased Government employee by way of allowances and concessions - of retaining occupation of the Government residence on specified terms, of family pension and other allowance. As regards the second part, it deals with income from other source which any way is receivable by the dependants of the deceased Government employee. That cannot be deducted from the claim amount, for determination of a just compensation under the Act of 1988.\n\n\tThe claimants are legitimately entitled to claim for the loss of \"pay and wages\" of the deceased Government employee against the tortfeasor or Insurance Company, as the case may be, covered by the first part of Rule 5 under the Act of 1988. The claimants or dependents of the deceased Government employee (employed by State of Haryana), however, cannot set up a claim for the same subject falling under the first part of Rule 5 - \"pay and allowances\", which are receivable by them from employer (State) under Rule 5 (1) of the Rules of 2006. In that, if the deceased employee was to survive the motor accident injury, would have remained in employment and earned his regular pay and allowances. Any other interpretation of the said Rules would inevitably result in double payment towards the same head of loss of \"pay and wages\" of the deceased Government employee entailing in grant of bonanza, largesse or source of profit to the dependants / claimants.\n\n\tThe amount receivable by the dependants / claimants towards the head of pay and allowances in the form of ex-gratia financial assistance, therefore, cannot be paid for the second time to the claimants. True it is, that the Rules of 2006 would come into play if the Government employee dies in harness even due to natural death. At the same time, the Rules of 2006 do not expressly enable the dependents of the deceased Government employee to claim similar amount from the tortfeasor or Insurance Company because of the accidental death of the deceased Government employee. The harmonious approach for determining a just compensation payable under the Act of 1988, therefore, is to exclude the amount received or receivable by the dependents of the deceased Government employee under the Rules of 2006 towards the head financial assistance equivalent to \"pay and other allowances\" that was last drawn by the deceased Government employee in the normal course. This is not to say that the amount or payment receivable by the dependents of the deceased Government employee under Rule 5 (1) of the Rules, is the total entitlement under the head of \"loss of income\". So far as the claim towards loss of future escalation of income and other benefits, if the deceased Government employee had survived the accident can still be pursued by them in their claim under the Act of 1988. For, it is not covered by the Rules of 2006. Similarly, other benefits extended to the dependents of the deceased Government employee in terms of sub-rule (2) to sub-rule (5) of Rule 5 including family pension, Life Insurance, Provident Fund etc., that must remain unaffected and cannot be allowed to be deducted, which, any way would be paid to the dependents of the deceased Government employee, applying the principle expounded in Helen C.Rebello [1999(1) ALL MR 670 (S.C.)] and Patricia Jean Mahajan's case [2002(4) ALL MR 886 (S.C.)].\n\n1999(1) ALL MR 670 (S.C.), 2002(4) ALL MR 886 (S.C.)

The number of children and should they be living, are the matters of legislative wisdom, and altering it in any manner would amount to tinkering with the legislation or reframing it. The conspicuous absence of the word 'living' in Section 14(1)(j-1) of the said Act is an indication of deviation in the policy of having more than two living children, incorporated under Section 175(1)(q) of the Haryana Panchayati Raj Act, 1994 and the same is not open to judicial scrutiny.

Act (1992) these forest were managed by appellant earstwhile Ruler of Kutlehar - Appellant in 1995 offered resin blazes to State Forest Corporation and claimed cost of resin tapping for 1995 season - Held, appellant was entitled for his legitimate dues - Question of vesting of forest on or after 11-3-1995 appointed day by H.P. Act (1992) was immaterial - Matter remitted to High Court for fresh consideration.\n\nIn the instant case, Kutlehar was a small princely State in Kangra Hills having 16 Tapas (Tikas) as forests which were known as 'Kutlehar Forests'. These forests were managed by the Raja of Kutlehar subject to the terms and conditions specified by the then Government. By Notification No.4531-FT(CH-58/523 dated 1.10.1958 issued under Section 2(2) of the Forest Act, Raja was appointed as a Forest Superintendent and the employees working under him in the aforesaid forest declared as Forest Officers with respect to Kutlehar Forest. As per the terms of his appointment, he was held entitled to retain 3/4th of the income derivable from the forest where 1/4th of the gross income was payable to the Government.\n\nHeld that, appellant earstwhile Ruler was entitled to his legitimate dues. It cannot be said that in view of S.4 of H.P. Act (1992) the right, title and interest of the plaintiff/appellant herein grantee/superintendent of Kutlehar Forests stood extinguished on the appointed day, i.e. 11.03.1995, therefore, he was under no obligation to continue with the management of the forests nor has any right to share in income arising out of the produce of the said forests on and after 11.03.1995. It is true that after 11.03.1995, the appellant cannot have any right over the forest produce. However, in view of the earlier order Dt.31-3-1999 in Civil Appeal No.9495 of 1995 the passed by Supreme Court clarifying the position and his entitlement, there is no need to go into the vesting right etc. as claimed by the State Government.   [Para 9]\n\nInasmuch as the appellant was continuing as Superintendent of Forests without a specific salary but with an assurance of 3/4th price of forest produce such as resin blazes etc. till the appointed day, i.e. 11.03.1995, the appellant is entitled for his legitimate dues till such date. Those aspects were not being correctly adverted to and appreciated by the single Judge as well as by the Division Bench of the High Court and mainly concentrated on the \"vesting\" of forests on or after 11.03.1995 in favour of the State Corporation by holding that the appellant was not entitled to claim anything thereafter. Even though the appellant placed relevant materials including the assertion and statement of PW-3 who is none else than the Divisional Manager for the State Corporation, those aspects have not been properly appreciated. In those circumstances, ends of justice would be met by remitting the matter to the Single Judge for fresh disposal and quantifying the eligible amount.   [Para 9,10]"

Under 2008 rules the person engaged in the collection of hazardous waste has to obtain authorisation from respondent No.2 in the State of Maharashtra as much as respondent No.2 would authorise such facility to collect waste under the old rules by an application made in a specified format in that behalf. Not only the collection and treatment, but recycling reprocessing, storage and disposal of the waste by such facilities would be only as per the authorisation of respondent No.2 in the State of Maharashtra. Only the proviso with relation to the assignment of the area of operation is not expressly incorporated in the new rules. However, since the very collection as also the treatment, recycling, reprocessing, storage and disposal is under the authorisation of respondent No.2, the area of such operation would fall impliedly within the jurisdiction and authority of respondent No.2 to grant and authorise. The work of collection, treatment, management and disposal of the chemical effluents would be better managed by more facilities in a given area as required by the economic situation. The monopoly of a facility may, therefore, be denuded. It may give way to a duopoly and later a perfectly competitive market. Of course, market forces determining the business of these facilities would be expected to play a role as in all other trades and businesses. However, it is the duty of the Central Government to see that the relevant departments of the State Government monitor the operations of the effluent treatment and waste disposal facilities. It is in that behalf that the monitoring and supervisory role of respondent No.2 would be required. Consequently, the facilities would require obtaining the authorisation from respondent No.2 as such monitoring authority in the State of Maharashtra. Respondent No.2 would monitor the activities from the collection to the disposal of the effluent waste of hazardous chemicals. In the course of such monitoring the area of operation also may be fixed. Consequently, the refixing of the areas under 2008 Rules by the order dated 11 December 2008 does not come up for challenge on the ground of it being a case of an act in excess of jurisdiction of respondent No.2.

The Act also clearly shows that from that date they shall become coparceners with the same rights and liabilities and the reference to the Mitakshara would also be reference including the daughter from then on. The express provisions in the Act are, therefore, inconsistent with any retrospectivity.  [Para 24]\n\nIt is settled law that unless the Statute makes a provision retrospective expressly or by necessary intent it cannot be interpreted to be retrospective. It is also settled law that vested rights cannot be unsettled by imputing retrospectivity upon a legislation by judicial interpretation or construction. Making the section retrospective would wholly denude the words \"on and from\" in the section; they would be rendered otiose. These words are unique and clear. They express the intent of the legislature which is not far to seek.   [Para 25]\n\nThe rights of a coparcener vest in him/her upon an interest devolving upon such coparcener. This interest would devolve by succession, intestate or testamentary. Upon the death of a coparcener his interest in a coparcenery property would devolve upon other coparceners. This devolution under the unamended Section 6 of the HSA was by survivorship in case of only male heirs and by succession, if there were female heirs also. After the amended Section 6 this devolution of interest would be upon the son and the daughter alike.

                ],
                "description": "\"Outgoing member\" - Interpretation of S.8(2).\n\nThe word \"outgoing\" has been defined in Webster's Third New International Dictionary as going outward, departing, retiring or withdrawing from place or position, something that goes out. The word, therefore, must receive a meaning consistent with the other provisions enabling constitution of the committee. The proviso to subsection (2) of section 8 of Haj Committee Act does not rule out nomination of the members of the past committee for a second term in such manner as may be prescribed. However, such members should not exceed more than 50%. If an outgoing member as is referred to in sub-section (2) is eligible for re-nomination on the committee for not more than two terms, then, if all the sections in Chapter II read together and harmoniously with their subsections, it is evident that a member of the outgoing committee shall be eligible for re-nomination on the committee. However, his re-nomination is restricted to not more than two terms.\n\nThe word \"outgoing\" would mean not a member departing or laying down office, but a member who had at one time held the office. He could have held that office even in the remote past. He, then, need not be a member of the immediate past committee or the committee whose term has recently come to an end. If that had been the intent, the wording would have been different and to exclude from re-nomination any past member. The Legislature could have excluded any person who held this office not in a recent Committee but one of the past. Therefore, insertion of the word \"outgoing\" and before the words \"member shall be eligible for re-nomination\" would indicate that the same is a reference to the committee whose term or extended term has expired or is expiring.\n\nIt is in these circumstances that whenever the Legislature had in mind a embargo or prohibition, it has specifically carved out the same as in the sub-section (6) of section 7 of Haj Committee Act, where it states in no uncertain terms that the term of office of the Chairperson and the Vice-Chairperson, as the case may be, shall be coterminous with the term of the Committee and no person shall hold office of the Chairperson or Vice-Chairperson, as the case may be, for more than two consecutive terms. Therefore, if such a person is holding office, his term is clear and the words \"holding office for not more than two consecutive terms\" conveys that if a person holds office of Chairperson or Vice-Chairperson, he shall not hold it for more than two consecutive terms. Holding office for two consecutive terms is, therefore, permitted. \t [Para 17,18,19]"

When no ex parte order are passed and both the parties are before the Rent Controller, there is no propriety for passing interim orders and for keeping original application pending. Proceedings under Section 17 themselves are matters involving some urgency and require early disposal. If both parties are before the Rent Controller, it is his bounden duty to dispose of the application itself under Section 17 forthwith. Inquiry under Section 17 is of summary nature.  [Para 5]\n\nIt is true that firstly direction will have to be given to the landlord but if it is found that landlord cannot restore amenity for one reason or the other, Rent Controller will not be powerless to give such permission as is necessary to the tenant to take further steps so that amenities could be restored. Intention of the legislature is quite evident from the sub-section 5 of Section 17, If the amenities enjoyed by the tenant are stopped by any other person other than the landlord for failure of payment of tax, etc., then the tenant can pay those taxes or charges and get amenities restored. Therefore, any direction which is necessary for the restoration of the amenities in real sense is well within the powers of the Rent Controller.  [Para 6]"

This contemplates that if there is an agreement to pay and/or tender the rent due on a fixed time, that the rent due shall be paid within fifteen days from the time specified in the agreement or contract and on such a failure the tenant will be defaulter.  If there is no time specified in the agreement for the payment of the rent due, then in that eventuality the tenant shall pay the rent by the last day of the month next following that for which the rent is payable and if the rent is not paid by the last day of the month next following that for which the rent payable, then the tenant becomes a defaulter.  Thus, in the first contingency tenant becomes a defaulter on completion of fifteen days from the time specified for the payment of the rent due in the agreement and in the absence of such agreement a tenant becomes a defaulter on completion of 30 days of the next following month of the due rent of the  earlier month.    [Para 9]\n\nWhenever the Rent Controller finds that the default as provided under clause (i) of sub-section  15  (2) is established, the Rent Controller shall find out as to whether the tenant has offered any explanation and/or has pointed out any facts which may point out that the tenant's default to pay or tender the rent was not wilful and whether the said explanation or the facts have been proved and established by the tenant and thereafter the Controller will have to consider whether such explanation and the established fact is sufficient to satisfy the controller that the tenant's default to pay or tender the rent was not wilful.  Therefore, the burden to prove that the tenant's default to pay or tender the rent was not wilful is on the tenant, because the circumstances and/or the facts as a result of which the tenant failed to pay rent and/or tender it are within the knowledge of the tenant which tenant can only allege and prove.  Therefore, even though prima facie it appears to be negative burden, factually and in reality it is a positive burden on the tenant.   [Para 10]\n\nIn the circummutence the finding recorded by the Distict Judge that the tenant was wilful default and that he had failed to prove that he was not a defaulter was proper and had to be confirmed.

The rent note on which the landlord has based his claim, is totally silent in this regard, and neither the purpose of letting out the premises nor the business to be carried out by the tenant is mentioned in the rent note. Consequently, the landlord does not fulfil the necessary requirement of Section 15(2)(ii)(b) that he had let out the premises for a particular purpose and that the tenant has used the premises for some other or different purpose.  [Para 12]\n\nIt is true that there is a specific condition in the rent note preventing the tenant from using the suit premises, for storing explosives or inflamable articles. However, Hyderabad Rent Control Act initially empowers the landlord to evict the tenant only on account of pure and simple breach of the terms of the rent deed. The breach of the agreement has to be with reference to the object and purpose for which the premises are leased out and eviction is therefore permitted under Section 15(2)(ii)(b). The breach simplicitor of the lease deed is not made a ground for eviction and therefore, even if the landlord succeeds in proving that the tenant committed breach of clause 5 of the lease deed regarding storing of explosives he cannot succeed in evicting the tenant.\t  [Para 13]"

This contemplates that if there is an agreement to pay and/or tender the rent due on a fixed time, that the rent due shall be paid within fifteen days from the time specified in the agreement or contract and on such a failure the tenant will be defaulter. If there is no time specified in the agreement for the payment of the rent due, then in that eventuality the tenant shall pay the rent by the last day of the month next following that for which the rent is payable and if the rent is not paid by the last day of the month next following that for which rent is payable, then the tenant becomes a defaulter. Before a tenant could ask for benefit of Proviso to S.15(2), he must claim and prove to the satisfaction of the Controller that the tenant's default to pay or tender rent was not wilful and, therefore, in case of a default the tenant has to come forward with an explanation and prove the said explanation so that the Controller can be said to be satisfied that the tenant's default to pay/tender the rent was not wilful, in the absence of such a plea and the explanation and proof of the same the Controller has to pass an order directing the tenant to put the landlord in possession of the premises and, therefore, on a proper analysis of the provision in respect of the default and wilful default.  [Para 11,12]\n\nIn case the tenant is in confusion as to whom he should pay rent because there were co-owners, he could take recourse to S.14(3) and in the absence of adopting such course, simpliciter ground of confusion made and cannot be a valid defence to hold that the tenant was not a wilful defaulter.  [Para 14]\n\nFurther, the practice of payment of accumulated rent could not be accepted by way of explanation or defence to infer that the default was not wilful default. If such practice is accepted for any defence covered under the proviso, the main provision is permanently defeated, and therefore, such a practice which defeats the main provision permanently and makes the law nugatory cannot be accepted as an explanation for inferring the tenant as not wilful defaulter. If a man claims the benefit of the statutory provisions, then he is equally under an obligation to discharge his statutory duty initially. However, the plea of practice of a payment of accumulated rent to be paid by the tenant shows that basically the tenant fails to discharge his statutory duty as provided under clause (1) of Section 15(2) of the Act, but claims the benefit of the proviso, which is against the settled principles of law.

In that case, he has to bring on record certain circumstances, which may indicate that even if there is default in payment of rent, because of those circumstances, it cannot be said that the default is wilful.  So, in whatever way the issue is framed, the question whether there was wilful default has to be decided on the basis of evidence led by the tenant. The tenant in the case has not taken the stand that due to certain circumstances, he could not pay the rent.  He has taken the stand that he had paid the rent.  So, when the landlord proves that rent was not paid, no question of proving that default was not wilful arises.  Some minor technical defect in framing of the issue will not give chance to the Petitioner tenant to say that the whole judgment and order is required to be set aside.

The agreement was not further extended but the tenant continued to be in possession of the premises. The date or time on which the rent was payable was not specified in the agreement. The case of the tenant was that it continued to yearly tenancy after completion of one year and as he had deposited the rent as per the summons issued in the civil suit before the eviction petition he was not defaulter. The landlord's contention was that in absence of further extension of agreement it was monthly tenancy and as the tenant had not paid monthly rent, he was defaulter.\n\nHeld that as the initial agreement was on yearly basis in the absence of further extension, it continued to be yearly tenancy. It was covered by the second half portion of S.15(2)(i). The rent, therefore ought to have been paid, after completion of one year of tenancy, within a period of one month next after the Last day of the month when it had become due. In the present case, the rent was due for the period 1-11-78 to 29-9-81 and as the tenancy was from Diwali to Dewali, two defaults were committed by the tenant i.e. from 1-11-78 to 20-10-79 and 21-10-79 to 7-10-80. The amount of first default should have been paid within a period 30 days from 7-10-80. As the rent was paid only on 7-10-81, the tenant was defaulter.  [Para 7,9]\n\nThe provision of S.111 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882, provides for termination or determination of tenancy by efflux of time. However, the Rent Act is a special statute which governs the relations of the Landlord and the tenant in respect of certain premises and therefore the said provisions cannot be applied to the tenancies covered under the Rent Act. Therefore, once the tenant is inducted into possession of the premises on yearly and/or monthly basis for a particular specific period, he continues to be the tenant of the said premises as per the initial agreement between the parties and the tenancy will not come to an end after the agreed period. AIR 1978 Andhra Pradesh 319 (FB), AIR 1976 SC 869 and AIR 1974 SC 818 foll.  [Para 7]\n\nThe first half of the clause of S.15(2)(i) applies to those tenancies where in the agreement of tenancy either oral or written, the parties have fixed the time for payment of rent after it has become due and payable. The second half portion i.e. \"in the absence of any such agreement ------- for which the rent is payable applies when the parties have not fixed the time for payment of rent after it has become due and payable. This clause does not govern the nature of tenancy. It only speaks as to what point of time a tenant is said to have committed default. The words in the absence of any such agreement referred not to the tenancy either monthly or yearly but it refers to the clause in the agreement of tenancy which specifies the date or time fixed for payment of rent after it has become due and payable and in the absence of such a clause, the second half portion of the clause comes into operation. If this analysis is not accepted, the yearly tenancy which is in the absence of any agreement, will not be governed by any clauses of the Act and in the result there will not be any default in respect of yearly tenancy. Such anomalous interpretation cannot be allowed to exist.  [Para 8]"

The rent was not paid as stipulated in second half portion of S. 15(2)(i) but deposited as per the summons issued in the civil suit and before filing the petition for eviction.\n\nHeld that the tenant was wilful defaulter.

The essential feature of ancestral property, according to Mitakshara Law, is that the sons, grandsons, and great grandsons of the person who inherits it, acquire an interestand the rights attached to such property at the moment of their birth. The sharewhich a coparcener obtains on partition of ancestral property is ancestral property as regards his male issue. After partition, the property in the hands of the son will continue to be the ancestral property and the natural or adopted son of that son will take interest in it and is entitled to it by survivorship.Therefore, the properties acquired by defendant No.2 in the partition dtd. 31.07.1987 although are separate property qua other relations but it is acoparcenary property insofar as his sons and grandsons are concerned. In the instant case, the properties are ancestral properties which have been divided as per the deed of partition dated 31.07.1987. The property which had fallen to the share of defendant No.2 retained the character of a coparcenary property and the plaintiffs being his sons and grandson have a right in the said property. Hence, it cannot be said that the suit filed by the plaintiffs was not maintainable. \t [Para 12,16]"

Essentially, the Administrator General steps in to protect the estate of a person who has died and no person to whom any court would have jurisdiction to commit the administration of the estate has come forth. The Administrator General is authorised by law to move the High Court to obtain letters of administration. Where the property or estate of the deceased is in imminent danger, the Administrator General can be empowered by the High Court to take immediate steps to safeguard the estate. While permitting the Administrator General to apply to the High Court for the grant of letters of administration, the law allows any other individual to appear and establish a claim before the High Court. Where a claim to probate or letters of administration in preference to the Administrator General is established, an order of revocation can be passed by the High Court. Such adjudicatory functions are entrusted to the High Court. The Administrator General, as a public official, is conferred with duties and obligations to secure and safeguard the administration of the estate left behind by a deceased individual in the circumstances adverted to in the statute. The legislation has not reserved a judicial power to the Administrator General. Parliament in its wisdom has made provisions to ensure that estates are not frittered away upon the death of persons who do not leave behind legal heirs, by allowing the Administrator General to invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court to safeguard such estates. The conferment of adjudicatory functions upon the High Court safeguards against an abuse of power and facilitates an adjudication of private claims. \t   [Para 23]"

The residence of respondent No.1(b) Manoj in the suit house would continue the process of keeping right of the appellant in abeyance. She cannot claim partition in the dwelling house when the same is occupied by respondent No.1(b) - Manoj and other members of the family. Due to death of Madhukar, there will be no change in the legal position qua the present appellant.\n\nComing to the question of effect of the change due to Amendment Act No.39 of 2005, it is important to note that Section 29-A is added under Chapter II-A. No doubt, it gives equal rights to daughter in coparcenery property irrespective of limitations contained in Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act. By the amended Act, Section 23 and Section 24 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 have been omitted. The omissions of these two Sections, of course, has nexus with introduction of Section 29-A under Chapter II-A. Section 23 stands omitted under the amended Act in order to pave the way for effective operation of Section 23-A. The amended provision of Section 29-A is introduced under Chapter II-A, which is part and parcel of Chapter II of the Hindu Succession Act, which contains Section 23. The provision of Section 29-A, as applicable to the State of Maharashtra reveals that the Chapter II-A shall not apply to a daughter married before the date of the commencement of the Hindu Succession (Maharashtra Amendment) Act, 1994. Thus, the daughters, who had married before the commencement of the Hindu Succession (Maharashtra Amendment) Act, 1994 are kept outside the beneficial zone of the amended provision of Section 23-A. In other words, the provision would be available prospectively. In the present case, the appellant was married much prior to commencement of the Hindu Succession (Maharashtra Amendment) Act, 1994 (MAH XL of 1994). Hence, she cannot claim benefit of Section 29-A. The omission of Section 23 under the Amendment Act does not open floodgate to the ineligible female heirs for the purpose of seeking partition of dwelling house. Their rights are still in abeyance until the male heir is in occupation of the dwelling house. Under these circumstances, the appellant is not entitled to claim partition of the suit house. \t\t\t\t\t [Para 15,16]"

Santi inherited the property in question from her mother. If the property held by a female was inherited from her father or mother, in the absence of any son or daughter of the deceased, including the children of any pre-deceased son or daughter, it would only devolve upon the heirs of the father and, in this case, her sister was the only legal heir of her father. Deceased Smt. Santi admittedly inherited the property in question from her mother. It is not necessary that such inheritance should have been after the commencement of the Act. The intent of the Legislature is clear that the property, if originally belonged to the parents of the deceased female, should go to the legal heirs of the father. So also under clause (b) of sub-section (2) of Section 15, the property inherited by a female Hindu from her husband or her father-in-law, shall also under similar circumstances, devolve upon the heirs of the husband. It is the source from which the property was inherited by the female, which is more important for the purpose of devolution of her property. The fact that a female Hindu originally had a limited right and later, acquired the full right, in any way, would not alter the rules of succession given in sub-section (2) of Section 15.\t  [Para 8]\n\nThe source from which she inherits the property is always important and that would govern the situation. Otherwise persons who are not even remotely related to the person who originally held the property would acquire rights to inherit that property. That would defeat the intent and purpose of sub-section (2) of Section 15, which gives a special pattern of succession.\n\nAIR 1978 SC 793 and AIR 1991 SC 2301 Rel.on.\t\t\t\t [Para 13]"

In the present appeal, we are concerned with plaintiff's title to the suit property. The plaintiff was adopted in 1964-65. However, adoption did not divest 1st defendant of the suit property which vested in her by succession on the death of her husband. It is for this reason that the plaintiff relied on Ex.P-1 contending that the said deed was a deed of adoption-cum-settlement. Transfer of title in favour of the plaintiff had no relevance with the adoption because mere adoption did not deprive defendant No.1 of her right to dispose of her own disposable property. In the present case, the High Court had erred in holding that the recital in Ex.P.1 was sufficient to constitute transfer of the title. That Ex.P-1 itself vested the suit property on the plaintiff. As held by the lower appellate Court, Ex.P-1 has not been stamped. It does not identify the suit property. It did not contain Valuation. In the circumstances, it did not convey any right, title or interest in favour of the plaintiff. The High Court has not gone into these aspects at all. There was no valid settlement. Consequently the lower appellate Court and the trial Court were right in dismissing the suit.   [Para 6]"

                "description": "Female who got properties from her parents dying issuless - Only heirs of her father are entitled to succeed to the properties left by her.\n\nSub-section (2) of Section 15 carves out an exception in case of a female dying intestate without leaving son, daughter or children of a pre-deceased son or daughter. In such a case, the rule prescribed is to find out the source from which she has inherited the property. If it is inherited from her father or mother, it would devolve as prescribed under Section 15(2)(a). If it is inherited by her from her husband or father -in-law, it would devolve upon the heirs of her husband under Section 15(2)(b). The clause enacts that in a case where the property is inherited by a female from her father or mother, it would devolve not upon the other heirs, but upon the heirs of her father. This would mean that if there is no son or daughter including the children of any predeceased son or daughter, then the property would devolve upon the heirs of her father. Result would be - if property is inherited by a female from her father or her mother, neither her husband or his heirs would get such property, but it would revert back to the heirs of her father.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 10]\n\nIn the present case, it is not disputed that she died intestate without leaving any son or daughter or children of predeceased son or daughter. Hence, the property would devolve on the heirs of her father. It is contended that she got the property because of the compromise decree and, therefore, the property is not inherited by her from her father or mother. This submission, is without any substance. She was entitled to inherit the property of her maternal grandmother as her mother had expired. As some dispute was raised by the other heirs, a suit was filed. In that suit, heir rights were recognized and compromise decree was passed in her favour. Result is - she got the property as daughter of her mother. That means, she got the property not from her husband or father-in-law, but from her mother side. In that state of affairs, the heirs of her father, would be entitled to inherit her property in view of Section 15(2)(a) of the Act.   [Para 11]"

                "description": "Disposition of undivided coparcenary interest by will - Right of female Hindu - Held, a female Hindu can bequeath her share or interest by executing a will.\n\nInspite of the restrictions on the disposition of undivided coparcenary interest by coparcener or by a widow by will under the Mitakshra School of law, in view of the drastic change brought in by Section 30 and particularly Explanation to section 30 of the Hindu Succession Act, the interest of a male Hindu in a Mitakshara coparcenary property shall be deemed to be property capable of being disposed of by a male or female within the meaning of this Section.\n\nSitabai got interest of her husband in the coparcenary property in 1942 as a limited estate but she became full owner of that interest in 1956 and by virtue of Section 30, she could bequeath her share or interest by executing a Will.\n\nEven though she was not in physical possession of the property, she was presumed to be in possession of the property as a person having share in the Joint Family property and her brother-in-law Balkrishna was possessing that property as Karta of the joint family and therefore she was supposed to be in the joint possession of the property.\n\nTaking into consideration the legal position stated above, it is clear that Sitabai was entitled to bequeath her interest or share in the joint family property by executing a Will in view of the provisions of Section 30 of the Hindu Succession Act. Whether the Will allegedly executed by her and propounded by the present appellant is a genuine or not is a different question which will be required to be looked into when the applicant will be called upon to prove the Will. However, it was wrong to reject the application to bring him on record as legal representative of deceased Sitabai in the Appeal at the threshold holding that she was not entitled to bequeath property by Will. Thus, the impugned order is clearly illegal and wrong and is liable to be set aside.  A.I.R. 1987 SC 2394 and 1993(4) SCC 392 - Ref. to.   [Para 8,10]"

Holding otherwise would mean that though the son of a predeceased son and not the son of a son who is intended to be excluded under S. 8 to inherit, the latter would by applying the old Hindu law get a right by birth of the said property contrary to the scheme outlined in S. 8. Furthermore the Act makes it clear by S. 4 that one should look to the Act in case of doubt and not to the pre-existing Hindu law. It would be difficult to hold today the property which devolved on a Hindu under S. 8 of the Hindu Succession Act would be HUF property in his hand vis-a-vis his own son; that would amount to creating two classes among the heirs mentioned in Class I, the male heirs in whose hands it will be joint Hindu family property and vis-a-vis son and female heirs with respect to whom no such concept could be applied or contemplated. It may be mentioned that heirs in Class I of Schedule under S. 8 of the Act included widow, mother, daughter of predeceased son etc. The express words of S. 8 of The Hindu Succession Act, 1956 cannot be ignored and must prevail. The Preamble to the Act reiterates that the Act is, inter alia, to 'amend' the law. With that background the express language which excludes son's son but included son of a predeceased son cannot be ignored.\t  [Para 20,22]"

It was at her parental home, that she was given education, got an employment and died intestate on 11-7-1996 leaving various bank accounts and a huge sum also in her provident fund account.

Admittedly all her properties were self acquired and not inherited from her parents' side.

Similarly, in a case where she had inherited some property from her husband or from her husband's family, on her death the same would revive to her husband's family and not to her own heirs. The law is silent with regard to self-acquired property of a woman. Sub-section (1) of Section 15, however, apart from the exceptions specified in sub-section (2) thereof does not make any distinction between a self-acquired property and the property which she had inherited. It refers to a property which has vested in the deceased absolutely or which is her own. The self-acquired property of a female would be her absolute property and not the property which she had inherited from her parents. In that view of the matter, sub-section (1) of Section 15 would apply and not the sub-section (2) thereof, In such a situation, the normal rule of succession as provided for by the statute, must prevail.\t [Para 9]\n\nIt is now a well settled principle of law that sentiment or sympathy alone would not be a guiding factor in determining the rights of the parties which are otherwise clear and unambiguous.  2008(9) Scale 241, (2008)7 SCC 210, (2008)7 SCC 770 - Rel. on.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 10]"

                "description": "Succession Certificate - In favour of widow of deceased - Widow not disqualified even if she remarries - As the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act, 1856 has been repealed, reliance placed on S.2 thereof is wholly misplaced.\n\nIt is true that section 2 of the Hindu Widows' Re-Marriage Act 1856 inter alia stipulates that all rights and interests which any widow may have in her deceased husband's property by way of maintenance, or by inheritance or by virtue of any will or testamentary disposition conferring upon her, without express permission to re-marry only a limited interest in such property, with no power of alienating the same, shall upon her re-marriage cease and determine as if she had then died. This was obviously in a case where no express permission to re-marry was given. However, we find that the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act, 1856 was repealed by Parliament by enacting the Hindu Widows' Re-Marriage (Repeal) Act, 1983. Therefore the reliance on section 2 of the Hindu Widows' Re-Marriage Act, 1856 is wholly misplaced.\n\nSection 14 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 inter alia stipulates that the property of a female Hindu is to be her absolute property. Section 14(1) categorically states that any property possessed by a female Hindu, whether acquired before or after the commencement of the Act, shall be held by her as full owner thereof and not as a limited owner. The explanation to section 14(1) clarifies that property includes both movable and immovable property acquired by a female Hindu by inheritance or devise, or at a partition, or in lieu of maintenance or arrears of maintenance or by gift from any person, whether a relative or not, before, at or after her marriage, or by her own skill or exertion, or by purchase or by prescription, or in any other manner whatsoever etc. Provision in Hindu Succession Act, 1956 in pari materia with section 2 of the Hindu Widows' Re-Marriage Act, 1856. In other words, there is no provision that disqualifies a widow of a male Hindu from inheriting from her husband if she remarries, after his death.  [Para 5,8]"

It is equally well settled that the claim of Hindu widow to be maintained is not a mere formality which is to be exercised as a matter of concession, grace or gratis but is a valuable, spiritual and moral right. From the judicial pronouncement, the right of a widow to be maintained, although does not create a charge on the property of her husband but certainly the widow can enforce her right by moving the Court and for passing a decree for maintenance by creating a charge.\n\nIn this case the original owner of the property, realized the fact that his wife 'V' was issueless and she has a pre-existing right to be maintained out of his property. He further realized that physically he was weak and may not survive for long period. He therefore, decided to give his properties to his family members. For the maintenance of his third wife 'V', he gave the tiled house with site and compound wall with the stipulation that she shall enjoy the property for life in lieu of maintenance. She will also be entitled to fetch water from the well and use other facilities. Admittedly, no one disputed the arrangements made in the Will and 'V' continued to enjoy the said property. In view of the admitted position, held that by virtue of S.14(1) of the Act, her limited right became absolute right to the suit property.  [Para 15,32]"

In the present case it is not disputed that Chinnu died some time in the year 1939 leaving behind him widow Premabai who continued to be in possession of the suit property, as a limited owner. She had a limited interest in the property on account of maintenance, it would follow that she continued to be in possession of the said property, even after coming into force of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 and therefore, it is obvious that she became exclusive owner of the suit property by virtue of explanation to Section 14 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956.\t [Para 11]\n\nThe plaintiff's contention that she was only a licensee of the property is required to be rejected because after the death of Chinnu in the year 1939, Premabai would be entitled to the right of maintenance in the said property by virtue of provisions of Hindu Women's Right to Property Act, 1937 (Act No.XVIII of 1937).  Hindu woman's estate recognized a woman's pre-existing Hindu law right to claim maintenance and the legislature did not intend to create a new kind of interest in her favour nor intended to make her to become a coparcener, though her interest in the family property is to be the same as that of her deceased husband, except that it becomes the estate of the widow.  Thus any property possessed by the female Hindu, whether acquired before or after the commencement of the Hindu.

The wording in the explanation \"and also any such right held by her as stridhana immediately before the commencement of this Act\", would indicate that Premabai came into possession of the suit property after the death of her husband Chinnu in the year 1939, and therefore, she would become exclusive owner after coming into force of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 because the Hindu Woman's estate recognize a woman's pre-existing Hindu law right to claim maintenance and the legislature did not intend to create a new ground of interest in her favour nor intended to make her to become the coparcener, though her interest in the family property is to be the same, as that of her deceased husband, except that it becomes the estate of the widow.

So, after the amendment of 2005, the status of the daughters are equated with the sons. So also, there is a presumption of the Hindu Joint Family, unless a severance is proved, but such presumption is not regarding Hindu Joint Family property. There is no escape from the Joint Hindu Family. May be in one generation, it is broken it is brought to end by partition, but again in the next generation it comes into existence automatically. For example, father dies then his sons and daughters constitute a Hindu Joint Family automatically. The death of the common ancestor does not mean that the joint family will come into an end. Upper links are removed and lower ones are added and in this manner, so long as the line does not become extinct the joint family continues and can continue indefinitely, almost till perpetuity.\n\nFurther, the settled law governing Hindus that there is no presumption that a family because it is joint possessed of joint property and therefore, the person alleging the property to be joint has to establish that the family was possessed of some property with the income and which the property could have been acquired. But such a presumption is a presumption of fact which can be rebutted. But, where it is established and admitted that the family which possessed joint property which from its nature and relative value may have formed sufficient nucleus from which the property in question may have been acquired, the presumption arises that it was the joint property and the burden shifts to the party alleging self-acquisition to establish affirmatively that the property was acquired without the aid of joint family. \n\nCharacter of any joint family property does not change with the severance of the status of the joint family and a joint family property continues to retain its joint family character so long as the joint family property is in existence and is not partitioned amongst the co-sharers. By a unilateral act, it is not open to any member of the joint family to convert joint family property into his personal property. \t [Para 27,28,30,32]"

S.14(2) is more in the nature of a proviso or exception to sub-section (1) and it excepts certain kinds of acquisition of property by a Hindu female from the operation of sub-section (1) and being in the nature of an exception to a provision which is calculated to achieve a social purpose by bringing about change in  the social and economic position of women in Hindu society, it must be construed strictly so as to impinge as little as possible on the broad sweep of the ameliorative provision contained in sub-section (1). It cannot be interpreted in a manner which would rob sub-section (1) of its efficacy and deprive a Hindu female of the protection sought to be given to her by sub-section (1). The language of sub-section (2) is apparently wide to include acquisition of property by a Hindu female under an instrument or a decree or order or award where the instrument, decree, order or award prescribes a restricted estate for her in the property and this would apparently cover a case where property is given to a Hindu female at a partition or in  lieu of maintenance and the instrument, decree, order or award giving such property prescribes limited interest for her in the property. But that would virtually emasculate sub-section (1), for in that event, a large number of cases where property is given to a Hindu female at a partition or in lieu of maintenance under an instrument, order or award would be excluded from the operation of the beneficent provision enacted in sub-section (1), since in most of such cases, where property is allotted to the Hindu female  prior to the enactment of the Act, there would be a provision, in consonance with the old Shastric law then prevailing, prescribing limited interest in the property and where property is given to the Hindu female subsequent to the enactment of the Act, it would be the easiest thing for the dominant male to provide that the Hindu female shall have only a restricted interest in the property and thus make a mockery of sub-section (1). The Explanation to sub-section (1) which includes within the scope of that sub-section property acquired by a female Hindu at a partition or in lieu of maintenance would also be rendered meaningless, because there would hardly be a few cases where the instrument, decree, order or award giving property to a Hindu female at a partition or in lieu of maintenance would not contain a provision prescribing  restricted estate in the property. The social purpose of the law would be frustrated and the reformist zeal underlying the statutory provision would be chilled. That surely could never have been the intention of the Legislature in enacting sub-section (2). It is an elementary rule of construction that no provision of a statute should be construed in isolation but it should be construed with reference to the context and in the light of other provisions of the statute so as, as far as possible, to make a consistent enactment of the whole  statute. Sub-section (2) must, therefore, be read in the context of sub-section (1) so as to leave as large a scope for operation as possible to sub-section (1) and so read, it must be confined to cases where property is acquired by a female Hindu for the first time as a grant without any pre-existing right, under a gift, will, instrument, decree, order or award, the terms of which prescribe a restricted estate in the property. Where, however property is acquired by a Hindu female at a partition or in lieu of right of maintenance, it is in virtue of a pre-existing  right and such an acquisition would not be within the scope and ambit of sub-section (2), even if the instrument, decree, order or award allotting the property prescribes a restricted estate in the property.  [Para 3,4]\n\nIn the present case, the properties in question were acquired by the appellant under the compromise in lieu or satisfaction of her right of maintenance,  it is sub-section (1) and not sub-section (2) of Section 14 which would be applicable and hence the appellant must be deemed to have become full owner of the properties notwithstanding that the compromise prescribed a limited interest for her in the properties.

It may be that, one and the same individual may be entitled for the rights as a coparcener, on the one hand, and right to succeed, on the other hand. While the succession would open, only on the death of the predecessor, the right to seek partition can be exercised even while the other coparceners, including the manager of the family is alive. Sometimes it may so happen, that against the same set of persons, an individual may have rights, partly of coparcenary in nature, and partly of succession. It can certainly be said that, one and the same item of property cannot be subject-matter of partition, on the one hand, and succession, on the other hand. More often than not, these two aspects are treated as interchangeable, or different facets of the same right. This naturally would give rise to certain complications.\t [Para 17]\n\nSections 6(3) and 8 of the Act deal with succession to the property, by a Hindu, who is governed by the Mitakshara Law. The succession provided for, under those provisions, has nothing to do with the right to seek partition.\t [Para 18]\n\nThe recent amendment to Section 6 of the Act has virtually obliterated the distinction between male and female members of a joint Hindu family, as regards conferment of coparcenary rights. The result is that wherever it is competent for a Hindu male, to exercise rights of coparcener, including the one, of seeking partition, it is equally competent for a Hindu female of the same degree, to exercise such rights. In view of this development, the right of the respondent, to seek partition of the joint family properties; cannot be denied. If at all she has to wait for the opening of succession, it is only in respect of the properties, that are exclusively owned by the appellants, and which are not part of joint family properties. Her right to seek partition of joint family properties is absolute, and not subjected to any riders.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 19]\n\nThe result of this discussion is that, the right to seek partition of the joint family properties conferred upon the respondent under Section 6(1) of the Act, and it is independent of, and different from, the right to succeed under Sections 6(3) and 8 of the Act. While the partition of the joint family properties can be sought at any point of time, the succession would open, only on the death of the owner of the property.   [Para 22]"

That means right of respondent as coparcener , equal in status and effect as that of a son, would have to be understood as having arisen on date on which she took birth and therefore , she would be entitled to claim her equal share in coparcenary property from that date, unless property has lost its character as coparcenary property by disposition or alienation made before 20/12/1994, as contemplated in proviso to sub section (1) of S. 6(1) read with sub section (5). In instant case, there has been no disposition or alienation including any partition or testamentary disposition as contemplated under S. 6(1) read with sub -section (5) before 20/12/2004 having taken place and, therefore, respondent would have equal share in coparcenary property and would be entitled to even re open notional partitions, which are not covered under explanation to sub section (5) of Section 6.\n\nS.6 makes respondent coparcener in her own right. Respondent daughter is not claiming share in property through her father. Property is ancestral and there was no disposition of property through testamentary succession. Contention that when substantive right under S.6 of Succession Act was created in year, 2005, there was no coparcenary in existence in relation to joint family of which respondent claimed to be member together with deceased brother, hence question of respondent claiming any share in property equally with brother would not arise.

Hence his succession opened on 23.11.1991. Consequently the law which applied to his succession was under Section 6 of the HSA as enacted in 1956 and prior to the law as amended in 2005. The father had left him surviving 3 daughters and 5 sons. His interest in his ancestral property which was Mitakshara coparcenary property, therefore, devolved upon his sons and daughters by intestate succession under Section 8 of the Hindu Succession Act and not by survivorship. For such interest the Hindu Coparcenary property and all the incidents of such Hindu coparcenary would have applied had he left behind only sons. But he left behind 3 daughters also. Hence the incidents of a Hindu coparcenary do not apply to his interest in the coparcenary properties. The succession to his interest in the coparcenary property would be under Section 8 read with Section 19 of the HSA. All his sons and daughters would share equally per capita as tenants in common. Upon their death their children would take their share.\n\nUnder that succession so long as the sons and daughters of deceased are alive, the grandsons or the greatgrandsons would not succeed at all to any interest in the coparcenary property which the deceased had. Such interest could have only survived to them as coparceners had there been no female heir of deceased (i.e. had deceased left no daughters or, of course, any persons claiming through daughters i.e. the heirs of such daughters).\n\nAIR 1969 SC 1330, AIR 1976 SC 109, 2009(2) ALL MR 93 Ref. to. \t          [Para 15,16]"

It would continue as before until any one coparcener died. The devolution of interest in the coparcenary got changed as per Section 6 of the HSA. It continued as before if he had only sons.

                "description": "Succession as per old S.6 - Devolution of joint family property or coparcenary property - Hindu father died intestate leaving behind 5 sons and 3 daughters - Only the interest of deceased in coparcenary property would devolve upon all 8 successors which would then become individual separate property of those 8 successors - Children of such 8 successors i.e. grand children of deceased would have no share in the interest of deceased so devolved - However the remainder of coparcenary property after the above said devolution, would continue to be joint - Grandsons and great grandsons of deceased, as coparceners, would have share in such remainder of coparcenary property.\n\nIn the instant case, a hindu father, the holder of joint family property or coparcenary property, had died intestate leaving behind 5 sons and 3 daughters. In view of facts that deceased had died in Nov. 1991 and left behind daughters also, his succession would be governed by old S.6 as enacted in 1956 and prior to 2005 Amendment.\n\nWhen deceased died, his interest in the coparcenery property devolved by succession upon his 8 children; 5 sons and 3 daughters and not upon all the surviving members of coparcenary including the sons of his sons. That however relates not to the entire properties of deceased but only to his interest as a coparcener in all the suit properties. The interest of the other coparceners who are his 5 sons and their sons would continue as joint interest in the coparcenary property with community of interest and unity of possession being the prime principle of coparcenery property. That coparcenary continued as before. The share which all the 8 successors got became their individual separate property. In that interest their sons and grandsons would have no share. But in the remainder of the coparcenary ancestral joint Hindu family properties the great grandsons of deceased would continue to have their share as coparceners.\n\nAll the sons of deceased, their sons and their sons' sons living at the time of the death of deceased would constitute the HUF of deceased. They are coparceners in the family. All of them would have by birth a right in the coparcenary properties/HUF properties/ancestral properties. They would have an undivided interest therein. They would have a right to partition those properties. Until the partition is applied for and granted they would have community of interest and unity of possession. Death of deceased i.e. holder of HUF property does not effect their community of interest and unity of possession. They continued joint since there was no partition of the HUF, though their coparcenary interest did not augment on death of deceased leaving behind 3 female relatives (heirs). Whatever be the share of all the coparceners being the sons, sons' sons and sons' sons' sons then living constituting the HUF, they would continue to have their share as before. Only the interest of deceased in that coparcenery property would succeed to his Class I heirs under Section 8.\n\nThe entire of the properties would not succeed to his heirs. The other coparceners would continue their coparcenary interest in the remaining ancestral joint family properties. They would be entitled to ask for partition of the coparcenary properties to the extent of the interest which continued joint. In a large family such as this the interest of the father would be equal to that of his sons, sons' sons and sons' sons' sons in the coparcenary property. Hence the entire property cannot devolve by succession. Only that limited interest would devolve by succession. The other coparceners, including the great grand sons would be entitled to demand partition of the ancestral joint family properties less the interest of deceased holder of properties and other such deceased coparceners.\n\nAIR 1986 SC 1753, AIR 1978 SC 1239, AIR 1986 Bom. 122 Ref. to.\t\t\t\t\t\t       [Para 15,23,33,36]"

Escheat is a doctrine which recognises the state as a paramount sovereign in whom property would vest only upon a clear and established case of a failure of heirs. This principle is based on the norm that in a society governed by the rule of law, the court will not presume that private titles are overridden in favour of the state, in the absence of a clear case being made out on the basis of a governing statutory provision. To allow administrative authorities of the state - including the Collector, as in the present case - to adjudicate upon matters of tittle involving civil disputes would be destructive of the rule of law. The Collector is an officer of the state. He can exercise only such powers as the law specifically confers upon him to enter upon private disputes. In contrast, a civil court has the jurisdiction to adjudicate upon all matters involving civil disputes except where the jurisdiction of the court is taken away, either expressly or by necessary implication, by statute.\t [Para 21]"

The share of the deceased so separated, thus, devolves by virtue of the proviso on the personal heirs of the deceased instead of vesting in any other coparcener by survivorship. Thus, the object of providing for notional partition is to give benefit to the personal relatives of the deceased coparcener, whether male or female, who dies rather than to allow such benefit by survivorship to others. The second aspect appears to be that the said concept of notional partition has been evolved by the Legislature merely to ascertain the share of the deceased or the quantum of property that is liable to testamentary or intestate succession under the provisions of the Hindu Succession Act. Thus, it is only for finding out or determining or demarcating the share of the deceased coparcener. But then the fact remains that there is no actual partition nor the actual partition could be even inferred under the said Explanation 1 of Section 6. In other words, the said explanation 1 is a device to find out an answer to the question; had there been actual partition immediately before coparcener died what share he would have got ? This is the only fiction which has been provided for in the said explanation. Once the said object of finding out the the answer to the said question is achieved, the rest of the exercise becomes redundant and no other member actually gets any share and the obvious reason is that no partition actually takes place. The notional partition is not a real partition. It neither effects severance of status nor does it actually delivers any shares.\t\t\t       [Para 9]"

There was no dispute till her death in 1990 and till the defendant - Appellant claimed share in the property and moved revenue authority for recording her name as one of the joint owners. There was never any dispute nor it can be stated that Gangabai had acquired rights in the property and, therefore, it can not be said that she had become absolute owner of the property or acquired any right in it, which could fructify into full ownership under Hindu Succession Act; and if she had no right or title over the property at the time of her death, her daughter could not claim any share by way of inheritance or otherwise.

However, with the advent of Act of 1956, which materially altered the Hindu Personal Law with regard to the succession, the widow has been placed as a Class I heir of her husband in the Schedule. In other words, by virtue of a widow being a Class I heir in the Schedule, under Act of 1956, she would be entitled to succeed to the entire share of her deceased husband in the joint property or ancestral property of the family with the same magnitude of estate, which her husband would have got had he been alive. In other words, her right to get an estate after the death of her husband like that of other coparceners in the family has been fully recognized and accepted by the Act of 1956. The concept of limited right or the concept of reversion after her death also stood abolished upon enactment of the Act of 1956 and as a result, she can deal with the property of her husband without any threat of reversion of her estate to the family of her husband. The right, that was given by Section 3 (3) of the Act of 1937, however, was of limited extent, in that, after her death, the property would revert back to the family of her husband. there is fallacy in the argument in that, Section 3 (3) provides for a right to file a suit for partition because there was no right at all in a widow even for her survival to get the property of her husband. In order that she must survive or must have some source of income for maintenance, Section 3 (3) was engrafted with a view to have her share but then in terms of the personal law of Hindus, a limited right was given to her. As against it, the Act of 1956 provides for a full right to a widow to the share of her deceased husband without any restriction of putting limited right or for dealing with share of her husband as per her choice.         [Para 17,24]\n\nSui juris means \"one's own right.\" As discussed earlier, right to share has been given to a widow upon death of her husband as per the Act of 1956, which was as per Section 3 (3) of the Act of 1937 of limited nature.

The Legislature has now conferred substantive right in favour of the daughters. According to the new Section 6, the daughter of a copercener becomes a coparcener by birth in her own rights and liabilities in the same manner as the son. The declaration in Section 6 that the daughter of the coparcener shall have same rights and liabilities in the coparcenary property as she would have been a son is unambiguous and unequivocal. Thus, on and from September 9, 2005, the daughter is entitled to a share in the ancestral property and is a coparcener as if she had been a son.\n\nThe right accrued to a daughter in the property of a joint Hindu family governed by the Mitakshara Law, by virtue of the 2005 Amendment Act, is absolute, except in the circumstances provided in the proviso appended to sub-section (1) of Section 6. The excepted categories to which new Section 6 of the 1956 Act is not applicable are two, namely, (i) where the disposition or alienation including any partition has taken place before December 20, 2004; and (ii) where testamentary disposition of property has been made before December 20, 2004. Sub- section (5) of Section 6 leaves no room for doubt as it provides that this Section shall not apply to the partition which has been effected before December 20, 2004. For the purposes of new Section 6 it is explained that 'partition' means any partition made by execution of a deed of partition duly registered under the Registration Act 1908 or partition effected by a decree of a court.

Therefore a male heir on whose desire the right of the female heir to claim partition depends must be or shall be a male heir of the deceased intestate. If the dwelling house is possessed by male persons wherein the deceased was a co-parcener but those male persons are not the heirs of the deceased intestate then in that circumstance the female heirs are entitled to claim partition of the dwelling house and the bar or embargo provided in section 23 of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 will not apply.\t  [Para 8]\n\nIn the instant case a Hindu Joint family consisted of three brothers and son of the deceased brother, Amongst other properties, the joint family owned a dwelling house. One of the brothers died leaving behind daughter his sole class I heir, there was no male heir of the deceased. Though the surviving brothers and brother's son were coparceners of the deceased they were not his Class II heir. Therefore even though they are residing jointly in the dwelling house of the joint family the surviving brothers and a brothers son their said joint residence or undivided residence could not be said to be joint residence and/or occupation by the members of the family of deceased and more clearly a jointness by male heirs of deceased so as to prohibit the daughter of the deceased to claim partition till the coparceners of the deceased choose to divide their respective shares. The thrust of law is on the words, \"until the male heirs choose to divide their respective shares\". and therefore, on analysis it follows that it is the only male heir or heirs of deceased who succeed the dwelling house alongwith female heirs can prohibit partitiion of dwelling house till such male heirs choose to divide their respective shares in the dwelling house.  [Para 8]\n\nThe scheme of the Act to the effect that as result of introduction of female heirs the share of deceased intestate stands notional partitioned from the rest of the male co-parceners. Therefore, the net result of introduction of female, being a heir of deceased intestate who expires in a joint family is destruction of co-parcenary and severance of status takes place which in the result is a partition in the eye of law and, therefore, the subsequent provisions deal with the rights of heir of the deceased. In this view of the matter section 23 has been drafted by the Legislature. The other section which can be equally pointed out is section 22 creating a preferential right to acquire interest of Class I heirs inter se is available to class I heir only.  [Para 8]"

Obviously, the demarcation of the interest of the deceased co-parcener has to be made from the date of his death which the proviso and Explanation makes it clear.  The interest of the deceased will devolve by succession which he would have got had the partition taken place immediately before his death, in short, the share of the deceased co-parcener gets fixed at the time of his death.  The device, is : had there been an actual partition immediately before the co-parcener died, what share he would have got?  This obviously means that for the implementation of the device of the notional partition the rules of partition as laid down in Hindu law are to be employed.  The share of the deceased co-parcener can be determined only on the allotment of shares to all members of the family entitled to a share on an actual partition, since that is the only means of individualisation of the share of the deceased co-parcener.  The share of the deceased co-parcener thus demarcated will go by succession.  In the rest of the  property the family will remain joint.  In short, share of deceased co-parcener gets fixed at the time of his death and subsequent fluctuations in fortune of the family do not affect it.  [Para 23,25]"

The initial part of Section 6 stresses that the Act does not interfere with the special rights of those who are members of Mitakshara property except to the extent that it seeks to ensure the female heirs as specified in Class I of the Schedule, a share in the interest of a coparcener in the event of his death, by introducing the concept of a notional partition immediately before his death. Proviso to Section 6 operates where the deceased has left surviving him, a daughter, or any female as specified in Class I of the Schedule. In the case at hand, 'J' has left the female heirs namely his wife and daughter and, therefore, the devolution of the property of  'J' was governed by the provisions of Hindu Succession Act and the High Court rightly increased the share of  'J's daughter.\t\t\t [Para 12]"

(1966)2 SCR 626, AIR 1977 SC 1944 - Relied. AIR 1966 SC 1879 - Distinguished.\n\nIn the instant case, the original Plaintiff made a claim as a Hindu widow for the bungalow as a part of maintenance on the basis of her residing therein since 1954-55. She was paid Rs.1250/- per month upon her becoming a widow since 1924. That maintenance amount was the amount granted/bequeathed to her under the Will of her deceased husband, made by him in 1918 when he went to participate in the first world war. It was payable out of the State funds as a fixed amount (\"Nakta Nemnuk\"). She has therefore claimed that the same was not the maintenance under the provisions of Hindu Law in her capacity as a Hindu widow.  The amount of maintenance payable to a Hindu widow may be paid in installments or as a lumpsum taking into account amongst other the necessity of providing her a residence. The residence is an essential part of such maintenance. The extent of the maintenance depends upon the status of the parties, being the status to which the widow was accustomed to during the life time of her husband. In this case the original Plaintiff lived in one of her husband's properties during her marriage. She would be entitled to live in one of such properties after the death of her husband. Her claim to maintenance would therefore necessarily have to take into account the need for such residence. In the husband's Will or otherwise her residence in atleast one of the properties of her husband could not be, and was not, denied to her. The extent of her monthly maintenance amount therefore did not take into account her need and claim for residence. It matters not from which coffers that amount was paid to her. It was paid to her in her capacity as the widow of the late Ruler. Though such payment must be taken to be for her maintenance and would debar her from claiming any further amounts as maintenance by her under the provisions of Hindu Law, it cannot bar her claim for residence.  Hence if a woman had been an owner earlier she would not need any further uplifting provisions. As an owner she could have independently possessed that property. The Section was enacted because she was not an owner, but merely possessed the property. That possession was because she was required to be maintained as a Hindu woman and as a Hindu widow by her husband and out of his properties. Such right is called \"limited ownership\", a legal term otherwise unknown to jurisprudence. It need not be mentioned that ownership rights are necessarily absolute. It need also hardly be mentioned that a Hindu woman always had the right to be maintained. Such maintenance partakes of the provisions for food, clothing as well as shelter. Since the right to be maintained is implicitly in the relationship of a marriage, any provision for the women's or the widow's upkeep is in lieu of such right of maintenance. A woman would therefore always have a pre-existing right as a condition of her marriage. A widow can therefore, be possessed of a dwelling unit or one of the properties of her husband, after his death as a consequence of the right of maintenance which always existed. That is a pre-existing right.   It therefore follows as a matter of corollary that only if her husband had more than one property and she was already maintained out of one of them or was otherwise not required to be maintained but was either awarded, gifted or bequeathed any property for the first time as such then alone the exception contained in Section 14(2) would apply for, then alone that property would be given to her \"for the first time\".  A Hindu widow is entitled to be maintained by her husband and out of his property, during his life time and after his death. That maintenance includes residence. Such maintenance may be of a particular sum per month which would enable her to obtain the basic needs of food, clothing as well as shelter. It may be partly in cash and partly by way of residence itself. Such is her right which emanates from the Shastrik Law. Based upon such right if she is granted any residence by her husband or by a testamentary disposition or if she is even otherwise given that right and comes to be possessed of any property it is in lieu of her maintenance. Such right, which is a pre-existing right, would always blossom into full ownership enabling her to deal with, enjoy, use, transfer or bequeath that property absolutely.  The case of original Plaintiffs for maintenance is completely on a different footing. She always had such a right. She could be given any residence as a part of such a right. That pre-existing right had only to be affirmed by the grant of a residence in lieu of maintenance, it becomes full ownership under section 14(1).  The original Plaintiff had a right in lieu of maintenance and got into possession of the property before the Hindu Succession Act came into force. She therefore, had a right of maintenance with actual possession and acquisition by actually residing therein and hence Section 14(1) of HSA gets attracted.  The possession of bunglow was consequently obtained by the original Plaintiff as her future residence in a capacity as the member of the family of Jamkhandi Ruler, a right which can be enjoyed by none other than a Hindu widow in her HUF. She came to enjoy that right for no reason other than that she had such a right pre-existing on that date in law. The very contents of the admitted correspondence relied upon by both the sides unmistakably show her right and the admission of such right by the grant of the residence.  The residence of Dowager Queen is therefore, implicit in atleast one of the properties left by her deceased husband. It was therefore upon that pre-existing right that she came to be possessed of bunglow in 1955, months before the coming into force of Hindu Succession Act. Hence, the denial of that right by the Defendants is contrary to the spirit, purpose, intent and object of that ameliorative provision.\t\t\t\t [Para 43,89,90,99,106,110,113]"

Section 6(1)(a) makes daughter by birth a coparcener \u201cin her own right\u201d and \u201cin the same manner as the son.\u201d Section 6(1)(a) contains the concept of the unobstructed heritage of Mitakshara coparcenary, which is by virtue of birth. Section 6(1)(b) confers the same rights in the coparcenary property \u201cas she would have had if she had been a son\u201d. \t\t   (Para 55)\n\n\tThe right conferred under substituted section 6(1) is not by survivorship but by birth. The death of every coparcener is inevitable. How the property passes on death is not relevant for interpreting the provisions of section 6(1). Significant is how right of a coparcener is acquired under Mitakshara coparcenary. It cannot be inferred that the daughter is conferred with the right only on the death of a living coparcener, by declaration contained in section 6, she has been made a coparcener. The precise declaration made in section 6 (1) has to be taken to its logical end; otherwise, it would amount to a denial of the very right to a daughter expressly conferred by the legislature. Survivorship as a mode of succession of property of a Mitakshara coparcener, has been abrogated with effect from 9.9.2005 by section 6(3). Though the rights can be claimed, w.e.f. 9.9.2005, the provisions are of retroactive application; they confer benefits based on the antecedent event, and the Mitakshara coparcenary law shall be deemed to include a reference to a daughter as a coparcener. At the same time, the legislature has provided savings by adding a proviso that any disposition or alienation, if there be any testamentary disposition of the property or partition which has taken place before 20.12.2004, the date on which the Bill was presented in the Rajya Sabha, shall not be invalidated.\t\t (Para 69)\n\n\tThe prospective statute operates from the date of its enactment conferring new rights. The retrospective statute operates backward and takes away or impairs vested rights acquired under existing laws. A retroactive statute is the one that does not operate retrospectively. It operates in futuro. However, its operation is based upon the character or status that arose earlier. Characteristic or event which happened in the past or requisites which had been drawn from antecedent events. Under the amended section 6, since the right is given by birth, that is an antecedent event, and the provisions operate concerning claiming rights on and from the date of Amendment Act. \t    (Para 56) \n\n\tSection 6(2) provides when the female Hindu shall hold the property to which she becomes entitled under section 6(1), she will be bound to follow rigors of coparcenary ownership, and can dispose of the property by testamentary mode. \t               (Para 60)\n\n\tWith respect to a Hindu who dies after the commencement of the Amendment Act, 2005, as provided in section 6(3) his interest shall pass by testamentary or intestate succession and not by survivorship, and there is a deemed partition of the coparcenary property in order to ascertain the shares which would have been allotted to his heirs had there been a partition. The daughter is to be allotted the same share as a son; even surviving child of predeceased daughter or son are given a share in case child has also died then surviving child of such predeceased child of a predeceased son or predeceased daughter would be allotted the same share, had they been alive at the time of deemed partition. Thus, there is a seachange in substituted section 6. In case of death of coparcener after 9.9.2005, succession is not by survivorship but in accordance with section 6(3)(1). The Explanation to section 6(3) is the same as Explanation I to section 6 as originally enacted. Section 6(4) makes a daughter liable in the same manner as that of a son. The daughter, granddaughter, or greatgranddaughter, as the case may be, is equally bound to follow the pious obligation under the Hindu Law to discharge any such debt. The proviso saves the right of the creditor with respect to the debt contracted before the commencement of Amendment Act, 2005. The provisions contained in section 6(4) also make it clear that provisions of section 6 are not retrospective as the rights and liabilities are both from the commencement of the Amendment Act.\t\t\t\t  (Para 61)\n\n\tThe proviso to section 6(1) and section 6(5) saves any partition effected before 20.12.2004. However, Explanation to section 6(5) recognises partition effected by execution of a deed of partition duly registered under the Registration Act, 1908 or by a decree of a court. Other forms of partition have not been recognised under the definition of \u2018partition\u2019 in the Explanation.\t                     (Para 62) \n\n\tThe statutory fiction of partition created by proviso to Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 as originally enacted did not bring about the actual partition or disruption of coparcenary. The fiction was only for the purpose of ascertaining share of deceased coparcener when he was survived by a female heir, of ClassI as specified in the Schedule to the Act of 1956 or male relative of such female. The provisions of the substituted Section 6 are required to be given full effect. Notwithstanding that a preliminary decree has been passed the daughters are to be given share in coparcenary equal to that of a son in pending proceedings for final decree or in an appeal.\n\n\tIn view of the rigor of provisions of Explanation to Section 6(5) of the Act of 1956, a plea of oral partition cannot be accepted as the statutory recognised mode of partition effected by a deed of partition duly registered under the provisions of the Registration Act, 1908 or effected by a decree of a court. However, in exceptional cases where plea of oral partition is supported by public documents and partition is finally evinced in the same manner as if it had been affected by a decree of a court, it may be accepted. A plea of partition based on oral evidence alone cannot be accepted and to be rejected outrightly. \t  (Para 129)"

The answer is in the negative. \t\t                                        (Para 82)\n\n\tOnce the constitution of coparcenary changes by birth or death, shares have to be worked out at the time of actual partition. The shares will have to be determined in changed scenario. The severance of status cannot come in the way to give effect to statutory provision and change by subsequent event. The statutory fiction of partition is far short of actual partition, it does not bring about the disruption of the joint family or that of coparcenary is a settled proposition of law. For the reasons mentioned above, mere severance of status by way of filing a suit does not bring about the partition and till the date of the final decree, change in law, and changes due to the subsequent event can be taken into consideration.\t                (Para 99) \n\n\tWhen the proviso to unamended section 6 of the Act of 1956 came into operation and the share of the deceased coparcener was required to be ascertained, a deemed partition was assumed in the lifetime of the deceased immediately before his death. Such a concept of notional partition was employed so as to give effect to Explanation to section 6. The fiction of notional partition was meant for an aforesaid specific purpose. It was not to bring about the real partition. Neither did it affect the severance of interest nor demarcated the interest of surviving coparceners or of the other family members, if any, entitled to a share in the event of partition but could not have claimed it. The entire partition of the coparcenary is not provided by deemed fiction; otherwise, coparcenary could not have continued which is by birth, and the death of one coparcener would have brought an end to it. Legal fiction is only for a purpose it serves, and it cannot be extended beyond In case coparcenary is continued, and later on between the surviving coparceners partition takes place, it would be necessary to find out the extent of the share of the deceased coparcener. That has to be worked out with reference to the property which was available at the time of death of deceased coparcener whose share devolved as per the proviso and Explanation I to section 6 as in case of intestate succession.          \nAIR 1931 Mad 404, AIR 1956 Nag 261, (2011) 9 SCC 788, (1954) SCR 53, AIR 1955 SC 661, (1987) 167 ITR 230 , (1996) 6 SCC 185 Rel. on. \t                             (Paras 101, 104)"

The intendment of the provisions is not to jeopardise the interest of the daughter and to take care of sham or frivolous transaction set up in defence unjustly to deprive the daughter of her right as coparcener and prevent nullifying the benefit flowing from the provisions as substituted. The statutory provisions made in section 6(5) change the entire complexion as to partition. However, under the law that prevailed earlier, an oral partition was recognised. In view of change of provisions of section 6, the intendment of legislature is clear and such a plea of oral partition is not to be readily accepted. The provisions of section 6(5) are required to be interpreted to cast a heavy burden of proof upon proponent of oral partition before it is accepted such as separate occupation of portions, appropriation of the income, and consequent entry in the revenue records and invariably to be supported by other contemporaneous public documents admissible in evidence, may be accepted most reluctantly while exercising all safeguards. The intendment of Section 6 of the Act is only to accept the genuine partitions that might have taken place under the prevailing law, and are not set up as a false defence and only oral ipse dixit is to be rejected outrightly. The object of preventing, setting up of false or frivolous defence to set at naught the benefit emanating from amended provisions, has to be given full effect. Otherwise, it would become very easy to deprive the daughter of her rights as a coparcener. When such a defence is taken, the Court has to be very extremely careful in accepting the same, and only if very cogent, impeccable, and contemporaneous documentary evidence in shape of public documents in support are available, such a plea may be entertained, not otherwise. We reiterate that the plea of an oral partition or memorandum of partition, unregistered one can be manufactured at any point in time, without any contemporaneous public document needs rejection at all costs. We say so for exceptionally good cases where partition is proved conclusively and we caution the courts that the finding is not to be based on the preponderance of probabilities in view of provisions of gender justice and the rigor of very heavy burden of proof which meet intendment of Explanation to Section 6(5). It has to be remembered that courts cannot defeat the object of the beneficial provisions made by the Amendment Act. The exception is carved out by us as earlier execution of a registered document for partition was not necessary, and the Court was rarely approached for the sake of family prestige. It was approached as a last resort when parties were not able to settle their family dispute amicably. Even before 1956, partition in other modes than envisaged under Section 6(5) had taken place. \t                         (Paras 127)\n\n\tThe expression used in Explanation to Section 6(5) \u2018partition effected by a decree of a court\u2019 would mean giving of final effect to actual partition by passing the final decree, only then it can be said that a decree of a court effects partition. A preliminary decree declares share but does not effect the actual partition, that is effected by passing of a final decree; thus, statutory provisions are to be given full effect, whether partition is actually carried out as per the intendment of the Act is to be found out by Court. Even if partition is supported by a registered document it is necessary to prove it had been given effect to and acted upon and is not otherwise sham or invalid or carried out by a final decree of a court. In case partition, in fact, had been worked out finally in toto as if it would have been carried out in the same manner as if affected by a decree of a court, it can be recognized, not otherwise. A partition made by execution of deed duly registered under the Registration Act, 1908, also refers to completed event of partition not merely intendment to separate, is to be borne in mind while dealing with the special provisions of Section 6(5) conferring rights on a daughter. There is a clear legislative departure with respect to proof of partition which prevailed earlier; thus, the Court may recognise the other mode of partition in exceptional cases based upon continuous evidence for a long time in the shape of public document not mere stray entries then only it would not be in consonance with the spirit of the provisions of Section 6(5) and its Explanation.\t\nAIR 1995 SC 1728, AIR 1967 SC 1124Rel. on. \t\t                                      (Para 128)"

The basic error seems to have crept in due to improper interpretation of Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. It is true, no doubt, that the succession had opened in the year 1962 i.e. after the commencement of the Hindu Succession Act. The concept of notional partition is a legal device used for purpose of demarcating interest of the deceased when the explanation (I) of Section 6 is attracted. Like any other legal fiction, the fiction of notional partition is meant for a specific purpose. It is not a real partition by metes and bounds. It neither effects a severance of status nor does it demarcate the interest of the surviving co-parceners or of any females who are entitled to a share on a partition. The share of the deceased co-parcener is required to be determined by notionally making allotment of his share which he was entitled to at the partition, on assumption that he was alive on that day and thereafter to divide his share amongst the legal heirs. The joint status of the Respondents was not impaired due to the introduction of Section 6 of the Hindu Succession Act. There is no reason to hold that the joint Hindu family was disrupted.

Law is not merely a biological text tracing decent and ascent. It is a sociological sanction in favour of those who can claim succession to the deceased. Sociology and history of given law often speak through the legislated words. The choice of the words \"by blood\" in the definition along with the word \"adoption\" is clearly intended to recognise all social modes resulting in the legitimate relationship. The words \"by blood\" cannot be read as \"by birth\" so as to restrict them to genetical incidence of family, for legislature, had it intended, would have surely spoken in that way.

Firstly, section 3 extended jurisdiction of Bombay High Court to Goa, Daman and Diu without any limitation (which would include the jurisdiction under Letters Patent). Secondly, Section 4 confers upon the Bombay High Court further jurisdiction which the Court of Judicial Commissioner exercised in the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu but which the Bombay High Court would not otherwise have but for such conferment by section 4. In other words, sections 3 and 4 of Act of 1981 have to be read harmoniously. There is no question of section 4 overriding section 3, because section 4 only confers additional powers on the Bombay High Court which were possessed by the Court of Judicial Commissioner in the Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu and which Bombay High Court would not have possessed otherwise. Of course, such additional powers of the said Court of Judicial Commissioner would be available in respect of the territories included in the then Union Territory of Goa, Daman and Diu and which are now included in the territories of the State of Goa and in the Union Territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli and Daman and Diu.\n\nSection 4 of the Extension Act of 1981 preserved the jurisdiction of the existing forum and conferred it on the successor forum in order to ensure that no area of jurisdiction of the existing forum was left out from the purview of the new forum. A Decree of Divorce under Canon Law was required to be confirmed by the Tribunal deRelacao till 16 December 1963 and thereafter by the Court of Judicial Commissioner. In the absence of Section 4, the permanent Bench of the High Court of Bombay at Goa would not have got the jurisdiction to entertain such a proceeding with effect from 9 September 1981. Section 4 therefore, transferred the jurisdiction of the existing forum of the Court of Judicial Commissioner to the permanent Bench of the Bombay High Court, at Panaji Goa. Section 4 is, therefore, an ex abundanto cautela provision which ensured that such an area of jurisdiction of the Court of Judicial Commissioner was not left out of the purview of the Bombay High Court. Absence of Section 4 would have created a void. Section 4 thus filled the void. Section 4, therefore, supplements Section 3, and does not override it. \t\t\t         [Para 22,26]"

                "description": "Allotment of tenements - Demand of additional price from allottees - Validity - In view of bar contained in Cl.2(w) of Hire Purchase Tenancy Agreement, Board cannot demand additional price from allottees after 7 years of allotment of tenement irrespective of justification for such revision.\n\nA conjoint reading of the allotment letter and clause 2 (w) of the Hire Purchase Tenancy Agreement, which every allottee is required to execute makes it clear that the price of the tenement specified in the allotment letter is tentative and the Board can revise the price after receiving final bills representing the cost of construction or if as a result of an order of the Court or an award made by the Arbitrator it is required to pay higher cost for the land used for construction of the tenements. In either case, the allottee is bound to pay the additional amount which would represent the final price of the tenement. If the cost of land is enhanced for any other similar reason then too the Board can revise the price and ask the allottees to pay additional price. In a given case, the Board may revise the tentative price more than once and the allottees are bound to share the burden of additional cost. However, the Board's power to revise the price of the tenements is hedged with the limitation of 7 years contained in clause 2(w) of the Hire Purchase Tenancy Agreement. That clause contained an express bar against the change in price after 7 years of the allotment of tenement. To put it differently, in view of the bar contained in clause 2(w) of the Hire Purchase Tenancy Agreement, the Board could not revise the price after 7 years of the allotment of tenement, irrespective of the justification for such revision. The Board's understanding of the prohibition contained in clause 2 (w) of the Hire Purchase Tenancy Agreement is evinced from Resolution dated 10.5.1989 wherein it was clearly mentioned that enhanced cost is not to be recovered from the allottees after 7 years from the date of allotment\n\nWhile preparing the format of Hire Purchase Tenancy Agreement, the Board must have taken into consideration various factors which could lead to an increase in the cost of tenements and consciously incorporated a prohibition against change in the price after 7 years from the date of allotment of tenements. The rationale of this embargo was that once the allottee pays the total price, he may not be subjected to the burden of additional cost after a number of years. Surely, adjudication of the landowners' claim for higher compensation is not within the domain of the Board or the allottees but once the Board has, after due deliberations, incorporated a prohibition against change in the price after a period of 7 years from the allotment of tenements, there is no reason why it should not be asked to honour the commitment made to the allottees that they will not live under the fear of being asked to pay additional price after an indefinite period. The use of the expression 'or enhancement in cost of land on any account' after the expression 'the receipt of the final bill for the construction of tenements or as the result of land award or arbitration proceeding' shows that while framing the regulations, the Board had kept in view all the eventualities which could lead to an increase in the cost of land made available for construction of the tenements and yet it thought proper to put an embargo against the revision of price after 7 years. Therefore, the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court were not right in deciding the writ petitions and the writ appeals on the premise that once the cost of land gets increased on account of payment of higher compensation to the landowners the Board is entitled to demand additional price from the allottees.

Here, the petitioners have vide ME 1927 dated 18/5/1983 obtained removal of condition of inalienability. It, therefore, appears that the land 499-EE may be covered under S.6 of 1954 Act. Chapter III beginning with S.7 onwards then deals with compensation and award thereof. Thus in order to find out status of petitioners or of deceased Laxman qua survey no.499-EE detail scrutiny of these provisions and its scheme is necessary. Law emerging then can be applied to facts settled. The distinction between Inamdar, Kabiz-e-kadam or a permanent tenant or tenant on one hand and any person holding under them on the other hand made by legislature with its purpose also need appreciation. When the land vests in State Government and question is of payment of revenue to it or of deposit of stipulated occupancy price or its recovery, these questions cannot be decided without hearing State Government. Admittedly, State Government was not party to S.A. 79 of 1972 and hence, nothing in it can bind it. The said adjudication cannot be treated as divesting the State Government of its rights under 1954 Act or then diluting or defeating its provisions. Whether a person in possession on 1/7/1960 who parts with it for valuable consideration in favour of some third party like present petitioners can still be treated as an occupant is vexed question to be answered within four corners of 1954 Act by the authorized officer. Validity of compromise recorded by the High Court in Second Appeal in relation to lands vested in State behind its back may also then surface for consideration. Parties coming together cannot violate the 1954 Act. Proceedings in which impugned orders came to be passed can also not be viewed as one under 1954 Act. When questions falling squarely under S.2-A arise, the determination has to be by the competent authorized officer and then an appeal against that judgment has to be before the State Government itself. Hierarchy of forums for filing appeals or revisions prescribed under Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966 is totally irrelevant thereunder.  [Para 22]"

However, one has to understand that matters under section 125 are not purely criminal of nature, but proceedings are of quasi civil nature, as issue of maintenance to wife is involved and therefore, the respondent is not an accused and statement under section 313 is not recorded while dealing section 125. So, the proceedings under section 125 are not treated as purely and strictly criminal proceedings, though the power to issue warrant is given to the Court.\n\n\nChapter IV of the Family Court Act, 1984 lays down the procedure which is to be followed by the Family Court. Section 9 is about the duty of the Family Court to make efforts for settlement. Under section 9, the Family Court shall make efforts in the first instance, wherever it is possible for settlement between the parties and for that purpose, it can follow such procedure as it may deem fit. Section 9 is exclusively about the settlement and section 10 is about the procedure which is to be followed generally. Under section 10(1) of the Family Court Act, the Family Court shall be deemed to be a Civil Court and shall have all the powers of such Court dealing with all the matters except the matters covered under Chapter IX of the Cr.P.C. for grant of maintenance under section 125 of the Cr. P.C. Section 10(2) states that for the purpose of conducting the matters of maintenance under section 125 of Cr. P.C., the provisions of Cr. P.C. and rules made thereunder shall apply to the proceedings before the Family Court. It means that the Family Court while dealing with the issue of maintenance shall follow the procedure under Cr. P.C. which empowers the Court to issue warrants, pass order of interim maintenance and follow the procedure under section 126 of Cr. P.C. Hence, the evidence is to be recorded in the presence of the respondent. However, the power to hear ex-parte is also given to the Magistrate if the respondent is deliberately avoiding the service of summons or attendance in Court. \t\t\t\t [Para 6,7,9]"

The wordings contained in Section 9(1), \"where it is possible to do so consistent with the nature and the circumstances of case\" would clearly indicate that the endeavour by the Court to assist and to persuade the parties in arriving at a settlement is required only if it is possible to do so in consistent with the nature and circumstances of the case. It is intended only to facilitate the parties to arrive at a settlement \"in respect of the subject matter of the suit or proceedings\". In a case of joint application filed on mutual consent seeking dissolution of the marriage, it is evident that the parties have already arrived at a settlement with respect to the issues relating to the matrimonial discord and regarding continuance of the marital relationship. It is on the basis of such a settlement that the joint petition is filed. Therefore there is no necessity existing in the circumstances of a case to persuading the parties to arrive at a settlement in respect of the subject matter of the suit or proceedings, because, as found above, the settlement in all the matrimonial cases need not invariably be that of a reconciliation or reunion of the parties to the marriage. But it can also be by facilitating a peaceful judicial separation by way of dissolution of the legal relationship. Hence the endeavour which should be made by the Family court under the mandate of Section 9(1) need not be followed as a compulsory procedure in the case of a joint application for divorce on mutual consent. If the court is satisfied about the genuineness of the application, it can definitely dispense with the procedure of counselling in such cases. However, the insistence for the statutory waiting period and the subsequent ascertainment of the attitude of the parties with respect to their determination of getting the marital relationship dissolved, is totally mandatory and need to be strictly adhered. However, above finding will not preclude the Family Court from making an endeavour for a settlement of reunion of the spouses, if it is found that there is a chance for such a settlement. \t [Para 7]"

The said marriage was dissolved by a decree of divorce from a competent court on 02.06.1988. The parties had again got married under the Special Marriage Act and once they got married under Special Marriage Act, therefore, their conduct with regard to the grant of divorce or relationship would be covered under the Special Marriage Act only. The respondent filed a petition for divorce under the Hindu Marriage Act. It is only incidental that some of the grounds which are available in Hindu Marriage Act may be available as a ground for divorce under the Special Marriage Act or under the other matrimonial laws like Christian Marriage Act, but that would not be a ground to convert a petition which is filed under one enactment to a petition under another enactment as that would be resulting in chaos because then there will be no end to the plea which will be available to a party though the marriage had taken place in a particular law but the ground of divorce is available in the different law and that is why the petition is maintainable.\n\nHowever, keeping in view the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, that the case has been pending in court for the last nearly ten years and it would advance substantive justice between the parties, an opportunity is given to the respondent to take corrective steps within a period of six weeks to rectify his mistake. In case such an application is filed, it shall be dealt within accordance with law.             [Para 33,41,47,49]"

In the present case, it is apparent that on 19.08.1977 the Hon'ble Apex Court expressly construed the provisions of Section 23(1)(a), particularly the words \"taking advantage of his or her own wrong or disability\" used in Section 23(1)(a) of Hindu Marriage Act and its conclusion or interpretation of those words.  The said interpretation is contrary to the application of mind & meaning ascribed to said provision by this court in Shantabai Prabhakar Kothale Vs. Prabhakar Atmaram Kothale.  The application for divorce under section 13(1-A)(ii) in present matter has been find on 19.02.1979 i.e. more that two years after the said judgment in Second Appeal by this Court.  The requirement of waiting for two years earlier existing in Section 13(1-A)(ii) has been brought down to one year in 1976 itself.  Fact that there was no cohabitation between the parties after 08.02.1977 and till 19.02.1979.  The Trial Court therefore has found that a fresh cause of action accrued in favour of the present appellant.  As per the law existing after 19.08.1977, a fresh cause of action accrued in favour of the present appellant on 19.02.1979 as inspite of restitution of conjugal rights decree parties had not cohabited.  The Court has delivered judgment on 08.02.1977 in Second Appeal No.385/1977, the proceeding there started on an application filed on 07.03.1970 by the present appellant.  It is therefore, clear that after 07.03.1970 till 19.02.1979 there was no cohabitation.  It is further clear that Appellant has not been held to be at fault for this later not staying together.  At the most it can said that he did not take any positive steps towards cohabition & remained only a mute spectator.  But that is not sufficient as per law prevailing during this period to deprive him of his right.  Not only this, even if this accrual of fresh cause of action in favour of the present appellant is ignored, it is more than clear that the earlier judgment between the parties was passed upon wrong interpretation or incorrect interpretation and the interpretation of those provisions on 19.08.1977 by the Hon'ble Apex Court changed the position and earlier adjudication between parties therefore could not have been held as res judicata between them in subsequent petition.  The  lower Appellate Court was therefore not correct in taking a contrary view of the matter.\t\t [Para 10]"

She has delivered a child of about 5 months old.  She is unemployed.  There is nothing on record to disclose that she has any independent source of income either to maintain herself or her child.  This observation is made only for the purposes of deciding the present case and shall not prejudice the parties in the proceedings filed by the Petitioner claiming maintenance.\n\nThe objection on behalf of the Respondent for transfer of his proceedings is mainly on the ground that the witnesses in support of his case for nullity of the marriage are from the District of Pune and therefore it will be inconvenient for the Respondent to secure their presence in the Family Court at Bandra, Mumbai, to prove his case.  Apparently, while the ground for transfer is inconvenience to and difficulties faced by the Petitioner-wife, whereas the objection for transfer of proceedings is inconvenience to the Respondent on account of difficulties which he may face in securing the presence of the witnesses.  The presence of the witnesses can certainly be secured by incurring necessary expenditure for the same and if required by getting the summons issued by the Court.  However, considering the inconvenience which the Petitioner may suffer on account of her child of 5 months old which she has to look after and in the absence of any independent financial support to herself and her child, the said balance tilts in favour of the Petitioner.\n\nBesides the observations in the Apex Court's decision in the case of Sumita Singh (Supra) that in a case filed by the husband, convenience of the wife is to be considered certainly comes in favour of the Petitioner coupled with the provisions of Section 19 of the said Act which gives jurisdiction to the Family Court at Bandra, Mumbai to entertain the proceedings which are initiated by the Respondent in the Family Court at Pune.

Pending said petition respondent-wife filed another petition for divorce u/s.13 of the Act.\n\nThereupon the husband filed an application u/s.10, CPC seeking stay of divorce petition filed by wife.  Respondent-wife opposed the said application of stay and also filed an application for clubbing of both the petitions saying that in the event both petitions are not clubbed, the Court will have to perform double exercise of conducting two trials of the petitions separately where the entire evidence and document will be common.\n\nThe Family Court disposed of both the applications preferred by the husband as well as the wife and ordered consolidation of the two petitions filed by the parties.\n\nThe validity of said order of consolidation is upheld in the instant case on following observations :\n\nThere is no express provision either in Hindu Marriage Act or for that matter in Family Courts Act or the Code of Civil Procedure, which authorises the Court to consolidate the trial of two separate petitions pending before it.  Nevertheless, such power can be exercised by the Court by invoking its inherent powers, when it is necessary for the ends of justice or to prevent abuse of process of the Court.  There is hardly any scope for argument that the Family Court which undoubtedly is also governed by the provisions of CPC, does not have jurisdiction to pass order of consolidation of two petitions pending before it even if the ends of justice so demand.  Indubitably, inherent powers u/s.151, CPC are certainly available to the Family Court, notwithstanding the provisions in the Family Courts Act.  There is no provision in the Family Courts Act, which would inhibit the Family Courts from exercising its inherent powers available u/s.151, CPC.\n\nThe provision of S.21-A of Hindu Marriage Act is neither an express bar nor can be considered as an implied prohibition for exercise of inherent power to order consolidation of trial of two separate petitions by Family Court.  Moreover the fact that S.21-A only refers to petition for judicial separation u/s.10 or for decree of divorce u/s.13, that does not mean that inherent powers of Family Court u/s.151 of CPC is impacted in any manner.  That power inheres in Family Court.\n\nIf that inherent powers were to be exercised in a given case, the question of entertaining application for stay of subsequent petition u/s.10 of CPC would not arise. S.10, CPC is not a bar to the passing of interlocutory orders such as \"an order of consolidation\" of the subsequent suit with the earlier suit.  Thus understood, once Court were to exercise the discretion of consolidation and direct joint trial of the two petitions, relief of staying the subsequent petition would not be available.  In that sense, a relief of stay of subsequent petition and the relief of consolidation are antithesis to each other.\n\nIn this view of the matter, the Family Court had rightly rejected the application of husband for stay of divorce petition.

                "description": "Family pension - Hindu second wife who marries Hindu Govt. servant during subsistence of his first marriage - Not entitled to family pension as she is not legally wedded wife and her marriage with Hindu Govt. servant is void ab initio.\n\nThe Maharashtra Civil Services (Pension) Rules were brought into force in the year 1982. Rule 116 (6) (a) (i) opens with the clause, \"Where the Family Pension is payable to more widows than one\". The provisions of Sub Rule 6 (a) (i) of Rule 116 of the Rules would apply only in a case where the family pension is payable to more widows than one. The primary question would be, whether the family pension is payable to second widow or more than one widow. More widows than one would be entitled to pension only if the Hindu employee has married the woman (widow) before the coming into force of the Hindu Marriage Act on 18.5.1955 and in case of employees where such marriage is permissible under the personal law applicable to the said employee or Government servant and the other party to the marriage. It appears from the provisions of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Conduct) Rules that the marriage during the life time of a spouse could be accepted only if the marriage is permissible under the personal law applicable to both the parties to the marriage. For example, Rule 116 (6) (a) (i) could be made applicable to more than one Mohmedan widows or also to more than one Hindu widows where the marriage between the Hindu male Government servant and the women (widows) was performed before the coming into force of the Hindu Marriage Act on 18.5.1955. Pension is liable to be paid to the widows in equal shares under Sub Rule (6) (a) (i) of Rule 116 of the Rules only where the family pension is payable to more widows than one. The said Rule was framed with an intention to provide pension to more widows than one, in the cases akin to the aforesaid categories of cases only. \n\n\tFamily pension cannot be made payable to more than one Hindu widows in equal shares, if the marriage between the male Hindu Government servant and the woman (widow) was performed after the coming into force of the Hindu Marriage Act. The object of Sub Rule 6 (a) (i) is to provide family pension to more widows than one only in certain contingencies and a woman contracting a marriage with a man during the life time of his wife would not be entitled to family pension, unless such marriage is permissible under the personal law applicable to such person and also the other party to the marriage. In view of the provisions of various Laws, pension is payable to the issues or children born from the illegal or void marriages but pension is not payable, at least under the Maharashtra Civil Services (Pension) Rules to a woman whose marriage with the Government servant is void ab initio. Some weightage would also be required to be given to the word \"widows\" as expressed in Rule 116 (6) (a) (i) of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1982. According to the Black's Law Dictionary, a widow would be a woman whose husband has died and who has not remarried. As per the Oxford English Dictionary, the widow would be a woman who has lost her husband by death and has not married again. It appears from the dictionary meaning of the word \"widow\" that a widow would be a woman who is married and has lost her husband. As the marriage between a Hindu male Government servant during the life time of his wife is void, the marriage between the said Government servant and the second wife would not be a marriage in the eye of law. The woman performing the so called 'marriage' with a Hindu Government servant during the life time of his wife cannot be said to be his widow. Rule 116 (6) (a) (i) of the Rules makes the pension payable only to widows and a woman claiming to have married a Hindu man during the life time of his wife cannot be said to be either his wife or his widow. On a reading of the provisions of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Pension) Rules, the Maharashtra Civil Services (Conduct) Rules, the Maharashtra Civil Services (General Conditions of Services) Rules as also the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act and Hindu Succession Act, it appears that Rule 116 (6) (a) (i) of the Maharashtra Civil Services (Pension) Rules, 1982 does not provide pension to a woman who marries a Hindu male Government servant during the subsistence of his marriage with his wife and during her life time. Even according to the Hindu Succession Act, a woman like the petitioner does not fall within the ambit of the term 'heir' and is not entitled to inherit the property of a Hindu male dying intestate, though the issues born to the said woman from a void wedlock would be entitled to inherit the personal property of the Hindu male dying intestate. \n\n2000(4) ALL MR 237 (S.C.), 2008 ALL SCR 1211 Foll. \t [Para 7]"

Subject to the limitation relating to remarriage by either spouse as laid down in Section 15 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, the effect of a decree of divorce is to dissolve the marriage for all intents and purposes from the date of its pronouncement.  Admittedly the divorce petition was decreed in favour of petitioner no.1 by the trial Court on 21/12.2002; respondent no.1 preferred appeal against the said judgment and decree on 16/1/2003; respondent no.1 moved an application for stay under Order 41 Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure along with appeal; petitioner no.1 appeared in the appeal and filed her say on 21/2/2003.  She however remarried on 9/3/2003 and hence by order dated 24/3/2003 the stay application moved by respondent no.1 was disposed of.  In the appeal preferred by respondent no.1 against the decree of divorce, though no ex-parte stay was granted to the decree, petitioner no.1 had appeared in the appeal and she was fully aware of the pendency of the appeal as well as the application for stay.  Hence it was obligatory on her part to wait till the order on stay application as well as till the decision of the appeal; instead petitioner no.1 remarried on 9/3/2003 and tried to get advantage of her own wrong by submitting before the appellate court that the application for stay had become infructuous because of the remarriage.  In view of Tejinder Kaur's case the said decree had not become final and as such she was not free to remarry till the decision of the appeal.  In this situation the relationship between petitioner no.1 and respondent no.1 is deemed to have been continued as husband and wife.  As such she could not have remarried during the pendency of the appeal.  In view of this position it cannot be said that the marriage between petitioner no.1 and petitioner no.7 is merely unlawful and not void.  The marriage between petitioner no.1 and petitioner no.7 is void and as such the provisions of Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code would be attracted.  Thus the learned trial Magistrate was justified in issuing process against the petitioners.  AIR 1988 SC 839 - Rel.on.   [Para 11]"

It is necessary to notice that neither Section 11 nor Section 12 of the said Act renders a marriage between a Hindu and a Christian void or voidable on the ground that the parties belong to two different religions. The rigour of voidness covered by Section 4 of the Indian Christian Marriage Act is stressed and attached more to the persons that officiate in the solemnisation of the marriages, and it does not envisage as regards the validity or otherwise of a marriage simpliciter that took place between a Hindu and a Christian. This view is again fortified by Section 4 of the Special Marriage Act, which permits a marriage between two persons of different faiths. Therefore, a Hindu can marry a Christian under the Special Marriage Act. Such a marriage cannot be held to be void on the ground that it was not performed according to the provisions of Section 5 of the Indian Christian Marriage Act. Similarly, Section 4 of the Foreign Marriage Act permits a marriage between parties, one of whom at least is an Indian citizen residing outside India. On a similar anology as noted supra, even a marriage under this Act, if performed between a Hindu and a Christian both or one of whom is an Indian citizen, cannot be held to be void on the ground that it is not performed in accordance with the provisions of Section 5 of the Indian Christian Marriage Act. Accordingly, in view of the above discussion, it has to be held that the marriage between a Christian and a Hindu performed as per the Hindu rites with the full consent of both parties cannot be said to be invalid for purposes of claiming maintenance u/S. 125, Cr.P.C. 1967 Ker LT 24, (1939) 40 Cri.L.J. 653, (1970) 1 SCWR 589 Ref. to.

Though the Court is empowered it cannot order a person to submit to such a test as a mater of routine and only in deserving cases such direction can be given.  The Court is expected to exercise such discretion/power, in matrimonial cases, only when such a test is in the best interest of the child.  The courts should exercise this discretion wisely.  The object of the court always is to find out the truth.   It is true that no person can be compelled to give a sample of blood for analysis against his/her will.  However, in the event of refusal it is open for the Court to draw an adverse inference.\n\nMerely because either of the parties have disputed a factum of paternity does not mean that the court should direct DNA test or such other test to resolve the controversy.  The parties should be directed to lead evidence to prove or disprove the factum of paternity and only if the court finds it impossible to draw an interference or adverse inference on the basis of such evidence on record or the controversy in issue cannot be resolved without DNA test, it may direct DNA test and not otherwise.  In other words, only in exceptional and deserving cases, where such a test becomes indispensable to resolve the controversy the court can direct such test.  DNA test, in any case, cannot be directed as a  matter of routine.  The courts should record reasons as to how and why such test in the case is necessary to resolve the controversy and is indispensable.\n\nIn the present case, the respondent-wife is seeking DNA test not in the interest of the child but in her own interest to establish that the petitioner-husband lives in adultery and is, therefore, not entitled for divorce.  The learned Judge has not recorded the reasons as to why DNA is indispensable and that the other evidence produce on record is not sufficient to draw an inference or adverse inference in favour or against either of the parties.\n\nMoreover, the child and his mother were not represented in the proceedings and the impugned order was passed behind their back clearly in violation of the principles of natural justice.  The court cannot direct DNA or any such test without hearing the persons concerned irrespective of the fact whether he is minor or major.  If such a person is minor, he should be heard through natural guardian. [Para 5,6,7,8]"

In pending proceedings even at the instance of the second wife in a void bigamous marriage, the court is empowered to make an attempt for re-conciliation, to pass necessary orders with regard to the custody of children and disposal of the property exchanged at the time of marriage.  The court has also power in such proceedings to make an order of permanent alimony or maintenance under Section 25 of the Act.  The Act confers wide powers on the matrimonial Court so as to regulate matrimonial relationship between the parties and such powers are to be exercised by the court even in a case of alleged or proved bigamous marriage.  In enacting Section 24 a special provision is made for ordering interim maintenance and the expenses of litigation to be provided for the contesting husband or wife if he or she had no independent sufficient income.  Therefore, there is no reason why the words \"wife\" or \"husband\" used in Section 24 should not be interpreted so as to include a man and woman who have gone through a ceremony of a Hindu marriage which would have been valid but for the provisions of Section 11 read with clause (i) of Section 5 of the Hindu Marriage Act.  These words have been used as convenient terms to refer the parties who have gone through a ceremony of marriage whether or not that marriage is valid or subsisting, just as the word \"marriage\" has been used in the Act to include a purported marriage which is void ab initio.

If misconduct of the spouse seeking maintenance pendente lite could be relevant factor, in no proceeding of divorce or dissolution of marriage or judicial separation, the, opponent spouse unable to maintain could seek interim maintenance since there would always be allegation of matrimonial misconduct against him or her in such proceeding. This was never and is not legislative intention of Section 24. While enacting Section 24, the legislature has provided the interim measure to the spouse having no means or inadequate means to seek maintenance from the spouse who has means to pay the same since because of matrimonial dispute till its resolution by the court, such affected party must be able to maintain herself or himself and contest the proceedings. The proceedings under section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act are summary in nature and at this stage, the court cannot embark upon the enquiry about misconduct of the spourse claiming maintenance or commission of marital offence.  [Para 7]\n\nIt is true that granting interim maintenance under section 24 of Hindu Marriage Act is a matter of discretion but like all other discretions exercisable by the court, this discretion too has to be exercised judicially and in accordance with law. The consideration of a factor which does not flow from a statutory provision if taken into consideration while exercising discretion, such exercise of discretion cannot be said to have been exercised in accordance with law.

The Family Court was not right in taking into consideration the allegation of fraud and deception made in the petition for the purpose of deciding the prayer of interim alimony. The fact that there is a strong possibility of the marriage being declared as a nullity is no ground for declining even the basic right to claim interim alimony and expenses of the litigation. The family Court was clearly wrong in postponing the determination of interim alimony till the trial of the main petition.

It is maintainable against a judgment. It is also maintainable against an order if it is not an interlocutory order.\n\n\tAs per the decision of the Supreme Court in Shah Babulal Khimji V/s Jayaben D.Kania [1981 SC 1786], an order and for that matter even an interlocutory order would be a 'judgment' if it has the quality of finality attached to it.\n\n\tWhat is noticeable in sub-section (1) of Section 19 of the Family Courts Act, 1984 is that it has deviated from Section 96 of the Code of Civil Procedure and from sub-section (1) of Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, in that, it provides for appeals against judgment. The Code of Civil Procedure does not provide for an appeal against judgments. It provides for an appeal against decrees and orders. Likewise Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 also does not provide for appeals against judgment. It provides for appeals against decrees and certain orders.\n\n\tAn order passed under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 though limited in its duration till the main proceedings are decided, is a final order. Indeed, the order would be a judgment because it decides matters of moment and which affects a valuable right of the parties. The expression 'some right or liability' is not restricted to the right in controversy in the main proceeding itself. It may be an order which is of an ancillary nature but is determinative of the rights and liabilities for the reason a spouse who is not able to maintain himself/herself without maintenance being awarded would be handicapped in litigating and per contra if the maintenance awarded is beyond the means of the other spouse and the spouse cannot pay the same the proceedings can be halted.\n\n\tThe reference is answered by holding that an appeal shall lie under Section 19(1) of the Family Courts Act, 1984 against an order passed by a Family Court under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.\n\n2005(23) LCD 1, AIR 2010 Utr 67, 192 (2012) DLT 714, 1981 SC 1786 Ref. to.

This is a jurisdiction to be exercised by the Court.  The parties, therefore, cannot by an agreement between themselves, agree to oust the jurisdiction of the Court which otherwise Parliament has conferred.  The second aspect of the matter is that permanent alimony and maintenance are a larger part of the right to life.  These provisions have been included to enable a person unable to maintain herself to be protected.  Therefore, any clause in a contract or consent terms providing to the contrary would be against public policy. [Para 8]\n\nIn this case, clause 4 of the consent terms provided that both parties undertake not to initiate any proceedings against each other in future and clause 5 provided that wife will not claim any maintenance or alimony in future.  Held, Clause 5 of the consent terms is clearly severable from the other terms of the consent terms.  Clause 5 would be contrary to public policy and consequently that clause will have to be treated as nonest.  The only question is whether Clause 4 would bar the appellant herein from so applying.  The very fact that clause 5 was placed differently from clause 4 will indicate that it ought to cover situations other than those covered by clause 5.  Even otherwise clause 4 to the extent that prohibits a party from claiming maintenance would also suffer similar consequences as Clause 5 of being against public policy.  Hence the appellant was not barred from applying under S.25(1) for maintenance.  [Para 8]"

The question is as to whether medical expenses incurred by the claimant can form part of an application under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act. The word \"support\" has not been defined under the Hindu Marriage Act. We will have to only look at the definition as given in the dictionary or as understood in general parlance. However, we can draw inspiration from the word \"maintenance\" which has been defined under the provisions of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. Section 3(b)(i) of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act defines maintenance to be inclusive of provision for food, clothing, residence, education and medical attendance and treatment. The definition here is also not an extensive definition, but inclusive one and nevertheless specifically mentions about medical attendance and, treatment. The meaning attributed to the word \"maintenance\" and as defined under Section 3(b)(i) can be taken to be the meaning even under the word \"support\" used under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act.

The spouses cannot dissolve the marriage on their own by entering into any sort of agreement and such type of agreement cannot be recognised by the court of law unless satisfactory evidence is led before the court, that by virtue of custom, a customary divorce has been obtained by them.

Unless there is any evidence in this behalf, an agreement produced before the court was nothing but a mere piece of paper which has no evidentiary value at all. By entering into such an agreement, a marriage can never be said to be dissolved in any manner. The Judge, therefore, committed an error in coming to the conclusion that in view of the agreement between the parties there was no subsisting marriage between the appellant and respondent at the time of filing of the application and that such marriage stood dissolved at the time of filing of this application. No weightage can be given to such an agreement by the court and therefore it can be said that the marriage was subsisting irrespective of such an agreement on the date of filing of the application.

Consequently, the petitioner-husband suffered mental cruelty and he has established and proved the same by acceptable evidence.

It has to be shown that other spouse has deserted. Therefore, it would have to be shown that respondent had willfully abandoned the company of petitioner as a distinct event, subsequent to the filing of second petition. It may at least have to be shown that the appellant had made an attempt to seek return of respondent to matrimonial home after first petition was filed and that such attempt was thwarted, giving rise to a fresh cause of action. Mere continuance of separate residence since before the filing of first petition till second petition was filed would not constitute a separate cause of action for seeking decree on the ground of desertion.   [Para 8]\n\nThe appellant through out was litigating in the hierarchy of courts and there was no occasion for the respondent to take a conscious decision of withdrawing from the company of appellant, from the day the first petition was dismissed till the second petition was filed, the respondent must be held to have lacked the necessary animus deserendi and therefore, it can not be said that there is any fresh cause of action for filing petition.   [Para 9]\n\nIn the circumstances since the respondent wife could not have had any opportunity for resuming cohabitation during the period the appellant was fighting with the respondent in the hierarchy of courts, there is no question of the respondent bearing animus deserandi ruling out any cause for the appellant to seek divorce on the ground of desertion.

Having regard to the nature of the proceedings in the main O.P., undoubtedly the issue of paternity of the child is also a necessary issue for effective adjudication of the controversy in between the parties. May be that the DNA test, even if reveals that the child was not born to the husband, would not decide the core question in the main O.P. whether the wife was pregnant by some other person at the time of marriage itself. It is also true that the DNA test by itself would not discharge the burden of proof placed on the husband under Section 12(1)(d) of the Hindu Marriage Act. However, undoubtedly, it is a piece of evidence to establish the case of the husband. Hence, it is a deserving case where the DNA test could be directed to be conducted. It is not contrary to the conclusive proof enjoined under Section 112 of the Evidence Act and does not suffer from any error of law or fact.

All said and done, finding on the question of cruelty can not be rendered without there being appropriate pleadings and required quantum of proof. The petitioner did not give specific instances regarding inhuman conduct of the husband. Indeed, he did not object for her further education and she completed graduation in Arts while in the matrimonial house. It is pleaded by the petitioner that all ornaments which were given by her parents were taken away by the respondent-husband. Not only that she failed to state the nature of ornaments and the period with reference to date and time of alleged incident regarding taking away of her ornaments by him but there is no whisper in her deposition regarding such incident. It appears that such allegations have been made without any substratum and just to carve out some incident regarding the ground of cruelty. It cannot be ignored that the statutory requirement of proof regarding alleged cruelty and necessity of pleading with required particulars can not be done away with, though some flexibility in this behalf is available in so far as matrimonial cases are concerned. 2005(5) ALL MR (S.C.) 313 - Rel.on.

                "description": "Cruelty - Non-consumation of marriage - Husband suffering from paranoid Schizophrenia and had attempted to commit suicide - Wife was 24 years of age when got married and marriage lasted for four to five months only when she was compelled to live matrimonial home - Parties have since been living separately for 13 years - Both of them crossing the point of no return and wife's stay with respondent would be injurious to her health - Wife had done her Ph.D. and husband was not gainfully employed anywhere - Husband refused to submit to medical examination and left his deposition incomplete during trial and did not appear before trial court or High Court - Held, this was a fit case for interference and reversal of findings of courts below in order to relieve appellant from shackles and chain of respondent and let her live her own life, if nothing less but like a human being.\n\nThe legal concept of cruelty which is not defined by statute is generally described as conduct of such character as to have caused danger to life, limb or health (bodily and mental) or to give rise to reasonable apprehension of such danger. The general rule in all questions of cruelty is that the whole matrimonial relations must be considered, that rule is of a special value when the cruelty consists not of violent act but of injurious reproaches, complaints, accusations or taunts. It may be mental such as indifference and frigidity towards wife, denial of a company to her, hatred and abhorrence for wife or physical, like acts of violence and abstinence from sexual intercourse without reasonable cause. It must be proved that one partner in the marriage however mindless of the consequences has behaved in a way which the other spouse could not in the circumstances be called upon to endure, and that misconduct has caused injury to health or a reasonable apprehension of such injury. There are two sides to be considered in case of cruelty. From the appellant's side, ought this appellant to be called on to endure the conduct? From the respondent's side, was this conduct excusable? The court has then to decide whether the sum total of the reprehensible conduct was cruel. That depends on whether the cumulative conduct was sufficiently serious to say that from a reasonable person's point of view after a consideration of any excuse which the respondent might have in the circumstances, the conduct is such that the petitioner ought not be called upon to endure. As to what constitutes the required mental cruelty for purposes of the said provision, will not depend upon the numerical count of such incidents or only on the continuous course of such conduct but really go by the intensity, gravity and stigmatic impact of it when meted out even once and the deleterious effect of it on the mental attitude, necessary for maintaining a conducive matrimonial home.   [Para 37,38]\n\nWhere the parties are young and the mental disorder is of such a type that sexual act and procreation of children is not possible it may furnish a good ground for nullifying the marriage because to beget children from a Hindu wedlock is one of the principal aims of Hindu Marriage where sanskar of marriage is advised for progeny and offspring. Spouses owe rights and duties each to the other and in their relationship they must act reasonably. In every case where cruelty exists it is possible to say that the spouse at fault has been unreasonable. The list of cruelty, therefore, should be breach of the duty to act reasonably, whether in omission or commission, causing injury to health. Such a list avoids imputing an intention where in fact none may exist. Further all such matters are foresight, desires, wishes, intention, motives, perception, obtuseness, persistence and indifference would remain relevant but merely as matter of evidence bearing upon the requirement to act reasonably or as aggravation of the matters charged.\t\t\t\t\t          [Para 43,45]"

In such matters, the paramount consideration should be the welfare of the family. The provisions of Hindu Marriage Act are wide enough to provide legal justification for the same. We can resort to principle of cruelty enunciated in sub-clause (1-a) of Clause 1 of Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and it could be said that the conduct of the wife was cruel enough to give rise to such suspicions and misgivings on the part of the husband. We need not be categoric or specific about it, but the husband had, his own reasons to suspect the fidelity of his wife. He even denied the legitimacy of the son born to her with the allegations that he has not visited his wife for more than a year before the birth of the son.   [Para 12,13]"

The two parties in this case must reconcile and if the appellant so feels that the respondent is still suffering, then she must be given the right treatment.

S.14 is applicable to a petition for divorce which is filed under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act and not a petition for nullity under S.11 or 12. Nullity of marriage is altogether of different status than divorce. Therefore, if there is a prayer for nullity of marriage, the petition is to be presented within one year as sub-Section 2 of S.12 lays down that no petition for annuling a marriage on the ground specified in Clause (c) of Sub-Section 1 shall be entertained if (i) petition is presented more than one year after the force has ceased to operate or as the case may be, the fraud has been discovered. Thus, the petition was filed not under Section 13 for divorce but, for nullity under S.12. Filing of the petition within one year from the discovery of the fraud or after the force has been ceased to operate is mandatory and, therefore, the petition was rightly filed within time under Section 12. However, in the said petition, there is an alternative prayer for divorce on the ground of cruelty. In the petition, there are averments in respect of the instances of cruelty and, therefore, alternative relief of divorce is prayed as the marriage was consummated between the parties. Alternative prayer of divorce in the petition for nullity is neither contrary nor inconsistent and can be entertained by the Court. In the instant case, Family Court is not found at fault taking view that the Court when heard the matter and the evidence of the parties was recorded found that the parties were residing separately since March-2007, i.e. for more than four years so bar under Section 14 will not come in the way, though petition was presented within one year from the date of the marriage. One important point is also to be noted that if a party wants to seek an alternative relief for grant of decree of divorce in a petition for nullity of marriage filed within one year, then it will be cumborsome for the party to file another petition for divorce after one year. This leads to multiplicity of the proceedings. Hence, the prayer for divorce can be made alternatively in the petition for nullity if filed within one year. If nullity prayed, itself makes an exceptional hardship. Needless to mention that after all it is left to the Judge, Family Court to consider whether the parties have an exceptional hardship and primafacie the petition can be entertained for nullity under Section 12(1)(c). There should not be routine practice to file a petition for nullity and put an alternative prayer for divorce under Section 13 giving a go-bye to the statutory provision under S.14 of the Hindu Marriage Act.\nAIR 1992 Karnataka 372 Disting.

It is not the better right of the either parent that would require adjudication while deciding their entitlement to custody. The desire of the child coupled with the availability of a conducive and appropriate environment for proper upbringing together with the ability and means of the concerned parent to take care of the child are some of the relevant factors that have to be taken into account by the Court while deciding the issue of custody of a minor. What must be emphasized is that while all other factors are undoubtedly relevant, it is the desire, interest and welfare of the minor which is the crucial and ultimate consideration that must guide the determination required to be made by the Court.     [Para 14]\n\nThe children having expressed their reluctance to go with the mother, even for a short duration of time, we are left with no option but to hold that any visitation right to the mother would be adverse to the interest of the children.

It was agreed between the parties that both the children would be in the custody of respondent/wife. It was also recorded that it was difficult for them to cohabit as husband and wife since they were living separately for more than 5-6 years.\n\nHeld that in the aforesaid circumstances, petition filed for divorce by consent under S.13-B need not be kept in abeyance for a minimum period of six months. The said period of six months can be waived when an application for divorce by mutual consent is filed during the pendency of the appeal. The intention of the Legislature was to provide minimum period of six months for re-thinking of the parties. If the said provision is made applicable to the appellate court, it would be powerless to grant that relief on the basis of the application filed in the lower court because 18 months must have elapsed by the time the matter reached the appellate forum although the parties are still fighting relentlessly in the appellate Court and, therefore, the said waiting period of six months can be waived in a suitable case by the appellate court because it could not have been the intention of section 13-B(2) that the appellate court should, in each case, insist that the parties should go through the futile and meaningless ceremony of again waiting for completion of six months.\n\nConsequently, when the appellate court is fully satisfied on the proved facts that marriage tie should be severed by mutual consent immediately since the parties have been living separately for more than the time prescribed under section 13B and that they have been fighting for sufficiently long period and, in such a case, section 13B does not impose any fetter on the powers of the court to grant instant decree of divorce.\n\nAIR 1986 A.P. 167 Foll.\n\n2008 (4) Bom.

He has gone to the extent of naming the person, who was the father of the male child born to the appellant-wife. It is in the process of substantiating his allegation of infidelity, that the respondent husband had made an application before the Family Court for conducting a DNA test, which would establish whether or not, he had fathered the male child born to the appellant-wife. The respondent feels that it is only possible for him to substantiate the allegations levelled by him through a DNA test. But for the DNA test, it would be impossible for the respondent-husband to establish and confirm the assertions made in the pleadings. The direction issued by the High Court, was fully justified. DNA testing is the most legitimate and scientifically perfect means, which the husband could use, to establish his assertion of infidelity. This should simultaneously be taken as the most authentic, rightful and correct means also with the wife, for her to rebut the assertions made by the respondent-husband, and to establish that she had not been unfaithful, adulterous or disloyal. If the appellant-wife is right, she shall be proved to be so. In case, she declines to comply with the direction issued by the High Court, the allegation would be determined by the concerned Court, by drawing a presumption of the nature contemplated in Section 114 of the Indian Evidence Act, especially, in terms of illustration (h) thereof. This course has been adopted to preserve the right of individual privacy to the extent possible. Of course, without sacrificing the cause of justice. By adopting the above course, the issue of infidelity alone would be determined, without expressly disturbing the presumption contemplated under Section 112 of the Indian Evidence Act. Even though, undoubtedly the issue of legitimacy would also be incidentally involved.            [Para 11,12]"

It seems that the petitioner-wife agreed for divorce by mutual consent on the condition that the respondent-husband will pay her Rs.12,50,000/- as full and final settlement. The petitioner-wife is suffering from such a disease which has compelled her to agree for the mutual consent divorce. The fact that petitioner-wife is ready for the mutual consent divorce after knowing about her medical condition raises a suspicion as to whether the consent obtained from the petitioner-wife is free as required by law for granting the decree of divorce by mutual consent. The Contract Act provides that consent is said to be free when it is not caused by \"undue influence\" as defined in Section 16 of the Act. The contract is said to be induced by \"undue influence\" where the relations subsisting between the parties are such that one of the parties is in a position to dominate the will of the other and uses that position to obtain an unfair advantage over the other. The principle of pre-exiting duty states that if a party to a contract is under a pre-existing duty to perform, then no consideration is given for any modification of the contract and the modification is therefore voidable. After the petitioner is fully cured from the disease or within six months whichever is earlier, the Family Court at Hyderabad, where the divorce petition is ordered to be transferred, shall take up the case along with a fresh application that may be filed by the parties under Section 13B for divorce by mutual consent.

However, the 'Cruelty' can either be physical or mental or both. Physical cruelty is easy to prove but the mental cruelty depends on various factors. It is the total behavior, which is to be taken into account. If one spouse's consistent behavior shows lack of respect, understanding, faith and also reveals acts intended to- and which have caused pain, discomfort or brought disrespect or disrepute, to the other spouse, such behavior would constitute cruelty. Trust, mutual respect, understanding and commitment sustain marriages. A certain level of tolerance and accommodation to each other's propensities, preferences and habits is expected. One cannot and should not expect one's spouse to possess identical tastes, temperament and behavioral traits as oneself or one is used to with one's family members. Over sensitivities to innocent behavior, attitudes of having one's way only cannot but result in mismatch and matrimonial discord. Spouses are expected to be supportive to each other and pillars of strength in adversities.  [Para 21,23]\n\nThe respondent was posted to Kashmir, at the time when that state bristled with terrorism. The husband as a senior officer of CRPF was expected to shoulder his official responsibilities. In this context the wife's letters to his seniors telling them that he had an inclination towards a Kashmiri family, leading to inquiries and his transfer to Assam, caused him serious trouble and embarrassment. It could be reasonably assumed that it affected his standing in the eyes of his staff and colleagues, and this bound to cause him humiliation and anguish, as there was no truth in the complaint. Beside this the undertaking given by appellant in police station that \"she will not fight\" is the admission of the appellant of her conduct.  [Para 24]\n\nIn this case the contemporaneous evidence on record is thus important to ascertain the conduct of the appellant towards the husband. The false complaints leading to enquiries, transfers, face loss in front of seniors and staff and subordinates, clearly show that this behavior of the appellant had lowered the husband's reputation and professional standing. There was absence of trust, faith and respect for respondent. Appellant has been persistently cruel towards her husband not only during their stay together but also during the divorce proceedings which is apparent from the fact that she had leveled the unsubstantiated charges of adultery against him. 2000(1) ALL MR 83 (S.C.), 2002(1) ALL MR 953 (S.C.)

Section 13-B contemplates a Petition initially filed by the parties. It would be filed upon the premise that the parties have decided that they could not and hence have not lived together but have lived separately.\n\nThe provision under Section 13-B(2) is the respite period granted to such parties to reconsider their decision to dissolve their marriage. The provision lays down what a Judge is required to do if the Petition is not withdrawn before 6 months to 18 months statutory period when it remains on the file of the Court. If a Petition under Section 13 has remained on the file of the Court for as long as 3 years as in this case, the parties require no respite period to reconsider their decision to dissolve a broken marriage in which various allegations based upon the grounds under Section 13 have been made and later withdrawn upon seeing reason.\n\nThe parties, who settle their dispute, are not required to be penalised for settling their disputes. They have gone through the process of divorce in the Court for more than 6 months when the Petition remained  pending. They have only modified their views upon settlement of the dispute. Hence such a Petition, though for divorce by mutual consent which would be granted to both parties and not for divorce upon the  grounds under Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, has lived through 6 months period in the Family Court already. Consequently, that period of 6 months, which the law requires the parties to undergo while the Petition remains pending, is undergone; only the acrimonious allegations are withdrawn so that the divorce can be granted amicably to both rather than to  one of the spouses. \t\t [Para 6,7,11]"

Cruelty must be a voluntary act of person who visits cruelty on the other. If a woman refuses sexual access, there are authorities to the effect that such a voluntary refual would itself constitute a cruelty and afford a ground for divorce. This is not a case where the woman is complained of as having denied sexual access to the husband. On the other hand, the apprehension of the petitioner is that if he has access to the wife, he will get infected with Hepatitis B. Section 13 provides for certain forms of illnesses in a spouse as affording a ground for divorce which include under Clause (iv) where the person has been suffering from a virulent and incurable form of leprosy and clause (v) states that a person has been suffering from venereal disease in communicable form. Both could be illnesses which could be transmitted by sexual access. These are the only two instances of illnesses, apart from mental illness, which afford a ground for a spouse to seek for divorce. A person suffering from Hepatitis B which could be communicated by sexual access is not a ground which is available under Section 13. \t [Para 3]"

Such aspersions of perfidiousness attributed to the wife, viewed in the context of an educated Indian wife and judged by Indian conditions and standards would amount to worst form of insult and cruelty, sufficient by itself to substantiate cruelty in law, warranting the claim of the wife being allowed. That such allegations made in the written statement or suggested in the course of examination and by way of cross examination satisfy the requirement of law has also come to be firmly laid down by Apex Court. \t\t [Para 7]\n\nIt is futile to claim on behalf of the appellant that the withdrawal of allegations unilaterally by the husband, by filing an application for amendment of the written statement wiped out completely all those allegations for all purposes.\t  [Para 10]\n\nThat apart, even the fact that the application for amendment seeking for deletion of the accusations made in the written statement was ordered and amendments carried out subsequently does not absolve the husband in this case, from being held liable for having treated the wife with cruelty by making earlier such injurious reproaches and statements, due to their impact when made and continued to remain on record. To satisfy the requirement of clause (i-a) of sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Act, it is not as though the cruel treatment for any particular duration or period has been statutorily stipulated to be necessary. As to what constitutes the required mental cruelty for purposes of the said provision will not depend upon the numerical count of such incidents or only on the continuous course of such conduct, but really go by the intensity, gravity and stigmatic impact of it when meted out even once and the deleterious effect of it on the mental attitude, necessary for maintaining a conducive matrimonial home. If the taunts, complaints and reproaches are of ordinary nature only, the Courts perhaps need consider the further question as to whether their continuance or persistence over a period of time render, what normally would, otherwise, not be a so serious an act to be so injurious and painful as to make the spouse charged with them genuinely and reasonably conclude that the maintenance of matrimonial home is not possible any longer. A conscious and deliberate statement levelled with pungency and that too placed on record, through the written statement, cannot so lightly be ignored or brushed aside, to be of no consequence merely because it came to be removed from the record only. The allegations levelled and the incidents enumerated in the case on hand, apart from they being per se cruel in nature, on their own also constitute an admission of the fact that for quite some time past the husband had been persistently indulging in them, unrelented and unmindful of its impact. That the husband in this case has treated the wife with intense cruelty is a fact, which became a fait accompli the day they were made in the written statement. [Para 11]"

When the status of a woman as \"wife\" is not recognized by provisions of the Act, which confers the right for permanent alimony, she can not be entertained for grant of relief in the absence of recognition of her status by the Act.\n\nIf the construction of word \"wife\" is not accepted uniformly, for the purpose of same remedy provided in special legislation [Section 125 of Cr.P.C., 1973] and personal law, anomalous position may occur.  A woman who has been denied maintenance in a petition under Section 125 of Cr.P.C., 1973, for the reason that she is not \"legally wedded wife\", would successfully pray and obtain permanent alimony in total disregard of earlier judicial pronouncement, as also, provisions regarding legitimacy of marriage as contained in personal law.\n\nEven while considering Section to be a \"welfare legislation\", it cannot be ignored that such a liberal construction, although may benefit the second wives, who are drawn into the form of marriage by keeping them ignorant about illegitimacy of the same, may encourage bigamous marriages with full knowledge and inspite of existence of a legislation in the field, preventing bigamous marriages.\n\nFor the reasons discussed above, with due respect, it is held that the decisions of the Bombay High Court, upholding right of maintenance to \"illegitimate wife\" [or \"faithful mistress\"] by liberal construction of word \"wife\" as contained in Section 25 of H.M. Act, cannot be said to be a good law and are required to be overruled to that extent. AIR 1988 SC 644 - Followed.  1987 Mh.L.J. 179 and AIR 1999 Bom. 127 Overruled.  [Para 21,24]"

If the wife is directed to be paid maintenance despite the said decree, reluctance of the wife to join the husband would be further strengthened and she would be encouraged to stay away from the husband despite the decree passed by the Court. The decree for restitution of conjugal rights would be rendered inoperative and for such an act of the wife, the husband would be penalized to pay the maintenance to the wife, who does not subject to the decree passed by the Court. Such a direction would be incentive to frustrate the decree passed under Section 9 of the Act.

Conjoint reading of Sections 10, 13 and 13-A , makes it clear that a discretion is given to the Court to grant alternate relief of judicial separation in the event, the petitioner makes out a case for grant of decree of dissolution of marriage/divorce in his favour. It is only then that the Court can exercise discretion taking into consideration the circumstances of the case and instead of passing a decree of divorce, pass a decree of judicial separation.\n\tThe issue in the present case is of propriety on the part of the Family Court in granting such alternate relief in absence of any material to justify the grant of such relief. Coming to the facts of the case in hand, the Family Court rejected the prayer of the respondent for grant of decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty, by coming to the conclusion that he has failed to prove the cruelty. In the Family Court, the parties did not lead any evidence in respect of judicial separation. Thus in absence of any material on record, the Family Court granted a decree of judicial separation in favour of the respondent, merely for asking. The Family Court has misread and misconstrued the provisions of Sections 10, 13 and 13-A of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and has erred in granting decree of judicial separation particularly in the light of the finding that the respondent failed to prove his case for divorce on the ground of cruelty. The material on record indicates that the allegations made by the respondent against the appellant were vague and general and at the most they can be termed as normal wear and tear of married life. Admittedly, the appellant is staying in the matrimonial home. In these circumstances, there was no occasion for the Family Court to abruptly come to a conclusion that it was difficult for the parties to cohabit together and therefore the decree of judicial separation was required to be passed to avoid complications. The said findings of the Family Court are based on wrong interpretation of relevant provisions as well as wrong appreciation of evidence on record. The Family Court has drawn unwarranted inferences.\nAIR 2008 Bombay 129 Foll.\t(Paras 21, 22)"

In the instant case, in the application at Exh.5, the wife had claimed that the husband was working with a Company called Bindview Pvt. Ltd. at Pune as a Senior Technical Lead and was drawing a monthly salary of Rs.62,000/-.  In the application at Exhibit-50, the husband came out with a case that he lost the said job and the subsequent job due to the acts of the wife and he remained unemployed for ten months.  Thereafter, he came to be employed with S.I. Services (I) Pvt. Ltd.  He joined the said company on 01-08-2004 and the Salary Certificate placed on record reflected that his gross salary was Rs.15,528/- per month with the said Company.  His net pay came to Rs.14,697/- per month.  When the application at Exh.40 was rejected, his employment with Vmoksha Technoligies Pvt. Ltd. on a gross salary of Rs.25,454/- for December, 2003 was taken into consideration by the Family Court.  Thus, the husband had made out a case for alteration of the maintenance amount on the basis of the subsequent change in employment and his monthly salary with M/s. S. I. Services (I) Pvt. Ltd.  The Family Court rightly entertained the application at Exh.50 and it cannot be accepted that the order passed below Exh.50 was without jurisdiction or powers.  If the circumstances change in the future in respect of either of the parties i.e. if the husband gets more salary or the wife starts earning, either of them may apply for alteration of the interim maintenance amount.

(1973), S.125 - Maintenance - Right of second wife - Second marriage during subsistence of first one is void ipso jure being in contravention of S.5(i) of Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 - A woman entering into such Marriage is not a \"wife\" within the meaning of either Hindu Marriage Act or Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act or S.125 of Cr.P.C. - Hence cannot claim maintenance under any of these statutes.\n\nA marriage contravening S.5(i) of Hindu Marriage Act is void ipso jure and the woman entering into such a marriage is not a \"wife\" within the meaning of either Hindu Marriage Act or S.125 of Cr.P.C.  The expression \"wife\" used in both statutes means only a legally wedded wife.  The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act cannot be treated differently for the meaning to the expression \"wife\" used therein.  The expression must be given the meaning in which it is understood in law applicable to the parties.  Since the institution of Marriage and the very relationship of husband and wife originates from personal law applicable to the parties, there can be no escape from reference to personal law while understanding the expression \"husband\" and \"wife\" used in different statutes.  As far as Hindus are concerned, the law relating to Marriage amongst Hindus is codified by Hindu Marriage Act and therefore unless the marriage is valid under the provisions of Hindu Marriage Act the parties entering into such a Marriage cannot describe themselves as \"husband\" and \"wife\" for the purposes of application of different statutes or for deriving the benefits available under different statutes.\n\nAs regards the argument based on S.18(2)(d) of Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act (which enables a wife to live separately and claim maintenance if her husband has any other wife living) is concerned, such a provision can obviously exist only in case of Marriages solemnized before Hindu Marriage Act came into operation.  Had the Hindu Marriage Act not laid down monogamy as a rule of law and that Hindu husband cannot marry another wife after the commencement of that Act, clause (d) could not have been included in S.18(2) of Hindu Adoption & Maintenance Act.  Further, a bigamous marriage contracted after coming into force of Hindu Marriage Act being null and void, question of having another wife cannot arise after the Hindu Marriage Act came into operation.  Therefore, it can be applicable only in cases where a husband has entered into two Marriages prior to coming into operation of Hindu Marriage Act.\n\nTherefore, the expression \"Hindu wife\" used in S.18 of Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, means legally wedded Hindu wife and no less. A second wife not being the legally wedded wife cannot resort to S.18 to claim maintenance.  AIR 1999 AP 19 - Rel. on.

Section 24 of the Act fundamentally deals with an ancillary or incidentally relief and is an enabling provision to empower either of the spouses to put forth the defences in the main proceeding. Section 23(2) and Section 24 co-exist in harmony and in fact if the context and subject-matter are appreciated in proper perspective, there is no anomaly in between the two provisions. Section 23(2) is not mandatory and does not operate in absolute terms. Any order passed without compliance under Section 23(2) as has been held in the case of Dharmendra Kumar would be an irregularity and not an illegality. Grant of pendente lite maintenance under Section 24 of the Act is not to be construed in a narrow compass. The jurisdiction of the Court to pass the order arises at the stage of institution of proceedings and continues till the proceeding is concluded.\t\tThe maintenance and the entitlement under section 24 of the Act can be made available even in a proceeding pertaining to setting aside of an ex parte decree and restoration of the main suit.

Next day wife handing over custody of her three year old son but refusing to return home - Held wife was guilty of desertion within meaning of S.13(1)(ib).\n\nIt may be that in the absence of the husband, the father in law of the wife ought not to have found fault with her paying Rs.110/- for a silver trinket if the father-in-law thought that the price was excessive. But this, did not justify the wife deserting the matrimonial home. Such differences of opinion, and perhaps insults, are a part of day today wear and tear of matrimonial life. The father in law might have honestly believed that the price paid was excessive. But this did not provide her a justification to leave matrimonial home and to quietly hand over custody of the child the next day when the husband met her.  [Para 20]\n\nFor the offence of desertion so far as the deserting spouse is concerned, two essential conditions must be there. (i) the factum of separation and (ii) the intention to bring cohabitation permanently to an end (animus deserendi). Looking to the evidence of the two spouses and the father of the husband there is clear evidence of factum of separation and of the intention to bring cohabitation permanently to an end. Conduct of the wife as also the conduct of her parents in not bothering to bring about any reconciliation leaves us with no choice but to conclude that the wife had deserted the matrimonial home with an intention to bring cohabitation permanently to an end. She willingly parted company of her son though the child was of a tender age of just 3 years and needed the mother's care most. The offence of desertion commences when the fact of separation and the animus deserendi co-exist. But it is not necessary that they should commence at the same time. The de facto separation may have commenced without the necessary animus or it may be that the separation and the animus deserendi coincide in point of time. In the present case both the conditions existed namely the factum of separation and the intention to bring cohabitation permanently to an end. Hence, the appellant-wife is guilty of desertion and this would be ground for the husband to obtain divorce under clause (ib) of sub-sec. (1) of sec.13 of the Hindu Marriage Act.  [Para 22]"

The legislative scheme clearly shows that the specified periods are not optional for the parties to be complied with because the cause of action is completed only upon conclusion of the period and clearly mandates the court to satisfy the requirements of law before passing a decree.\n\nSection 13-B is a complete code in itself. It provides for cause of action, grounds and reasons which are required to be satisfied by the parties, the procedure to be followed by the court and the premise which ought to be taken into consideration by the court before it passes a decree of divorce on the ground of mutual consent. The Act contemplates different remedies which are available to a spouse to a marriage under different circumstances. For availing of that relief, it is mandatory for the parties to satisfy the requirement and grounds specified under that provision. For example, seeking a decree for judicial separation, the parties must satisfy the grounds spelt out by the legislature under section 10 of the Act wherefrom, the parties seek a decree of divorce. They are expected to comply with the statutory requirements and establish and prove by due and cogent evidence either of the grounds stated in sub-clauses 13(1)(i) to (vii) and the other provisions of that section. Unless the court is satisfied that either of the grounds stated under section 13 of the Act is satisfied, the court obviously cannot pass a decree dissolving the marriage between the parties by passing a decree of divorce. In other words, the jurisdiction of the court to grant a relief under the provisions of the Act is controlled by legislative limitation of the respective provisions. To enact law is a matter in the domain of the legislature.  2005(1) DMC 571 - Not agreed.   [Para 10,13]"

In terms of section 13-B, there is hardly any burden of proof on either of parties as the foundation thereof is by mutual consent. The court is granted power to dissolve the marriage between the parties by a decree of divorce on the ground of mutual consent. In fact, it is an exception to the proceedings under any other provision before the court of competent jurisdiction for dissolving the marriage between the parties.  \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 14]"

The court has not been vested with any specific or even general power to condone the delay or waive the period stipulated either under section 13-B(1) and for that matter, under section 13-B(2). The legislature in its wisdom allowed the parties a limited right to seek divorce by mutual consent provided the parties present the petition in the court of competent jurisdiction on the ground that they have been living separately for a period of one year or more, they have not been able to live together and that they have mutually agreed that the marriage should be dissolved. Once such a petition is filed, the court has to satisfy itself of these requirements and thereafter, the parties are expected to take out a second motion which again has to be a joint motion but not earlier than six months and later than 18 months. Still the parties have to satisfy the court that the said petition was not withdrawn and the court is expected to record its satisfaction after hearing the parties and on making such enquiry as it thinks fit that the averments in the petition are true, court may pass a decree declaring the marriage to be dissolved on the ground of mutual consent. Apparently, the decree for divorce by mutual consent is dependent on fulfillment of the requirements afore-noticed and due satisfaction of the court. This cannot be termed as merely directory as the statute does not even impliedly indicate such intent of the legislature. The provision of a statute must be given its plain meaning and requirement of law stated under those provisions should be satisfied before the relief under the specific provision can be granted to the parties.

This is the significance of the provisions of section 13-B(2) of the Act. It will not only be unjust but would be impermissible on accepted norms of statutory interpretation that this period of six months is treated as optional, condonable or could be waived at the request of the parties. The law must be given a meaning that would be applicable and acceptable generally and not to a particular case. Firstly, the legislature has not provided any power of relaxation to the court in regard to the stated period of six months under section 13-B(2). Secondly, if this procedure is adopted at the behest of the parties by the court, it will amount to denial of a statutory benefit of rethinking. The period of six months is the product of the legislature and the courts have always upheld its validity. To waive or abolish by judicial dictum a specific provision of the legislature would amount to negating a statutory provision which is otherwise constitutional and cannot easily be dropped in reality. No prejudice is caused to the parties by merely waiting for a short period of six months before they take a vital and pertinent decision in regard to their marriage which is a social sacrament coupled with civil rights and obligations and which they had entered upon voluntarily and happily. Impulsive and impatient decisions rarely guide the parties to the logical and correct decision. They must have time to ponder over their decision and reassure themselves that the decision of dissolving their marriage is correct and needs to be implemented. For arriving at such a vital decision, the period of six months is to be held as mandatory and in conformity with the legislative intent expressed in no uncertain terms in the relevant provisions.

An apprehension is gaining ground that the provisions relating to divorce in the Hindu Marriage Act, 1950 has led to such a situation. In other words, the feeling is that the statute is facilitating breaking of homes rather than saving them. This may be too wide a view because actions are suspect. But that does not make the section invalid. Actions may be bad, but not the Section. The provisions relating to divorce categorise situations in which a decree for divorce can be sought for. Merely because such a course is available to be adopted, should not normally provide incentive to persons to seek divorce, unless the marriage has irretrievably broken. Effort should be to bring about conciliation to bridge the communication gap which lead to such undesirable proceedings. People rushing to courts for breaking up of marriage should come as a last resort, and unless it has an inevitable result, courts should try to bring about conciliation. The emphasis should be on saving marriage and not breaking it. As noted above, this is more important in cases where the children bear the brunt of dissolution of marriage. One must not lose faith in humanity. It is an ocean; if a few drops of the ocean are dirty, the ocean does not become dirty. If nothing ever went wrong in one's life, he or she would never have a chance to grow stronger. One should never forget that today well lived makes every yesterday a dream of happiness and tomorrow a vision of hope. Marital happiness depends upon mutual trust, respect and understanding. A home should not be an arena for ego clashes and misunderstandings. There should be physical and mental union. Marriage is something, Ibsen said in \"The League of Youth\" you have to give your whole mind to. If marriages are made in Heaven as Tennyson said in Ayloner's Field, why make matrimonial home hell is a big question.   [Para 50,51]"

                "description": "Desertion - Is a matter of inference to be drawn from facts and circumstances of each case - Essence of desertion means intentional permanent abandonment of one spouse by other without that other's consent and without reasonable cause.\n\nDesertion is a matter of inference to be drawn from the facts and circumstances of each case. What amounts to desertion in a particular case depends upon the circumstances and mode of life of the parties. In any case mere physical separation between spouses for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition would not constitute desertion. The factum of desertion and the intention of a party to bring cohabitation permanently to an end are the essential ingredients of legal desertion. In other words, the essence of desertion means the intentional permanent abandonment of one spouse by other without that other's consent and without reasonable cause. Insofar as burden is concerned it is always on the petitioner in proving the factum of desertion as well as animus deserendi, which the petitioner has to establish to the satisfaction of the court. Even if the wife, where she is a deserting spouse, does not prove just cause for her living apart, the petitioner-husband has still to satisfy the court that the desertion was without cause. Therefore, in a petition for divorce by the husband on the ground of desertion, it is not enough if it is established that the wife left the matrimonial home without reasonable excuse and against wishes of husband but indeed, it must further be shown that the intention was to bring cohabitation permanently to an end.  In the present case, it was apparent from the overall facts and circumstances of the case that the petitioner did not care for the respondent wife and his daughter or care to maintain his daughter after 11.7.1997. He never made any attempt to bring them back. There was no material on record to show that he made any attempts to meet his daughter either through mediator or through court or through his sister and her husband who were known to be the friends of the respondent. This conduct of the petitioner speaks volumes. If he genuinely wanted to patch up and bring the respondent and daughter back home, he could have done so either through the mediator or by giving her notice or by filing a petition for restitution of conjugal rights. He did none.  It is not sufficient for a husband to show that his wife had left him without an intention to return and that he is willing to keep the wife but she without any reasonable cause was avoiding his company. In order to support his case or to shift the burden, he must further show that the attempts were made by him to get back the wife to the matrimonial home. Further not only he should make attempts but the attempts should seem to be honest and genuine. This is exactly what is lacking in the present case. None of the attempts made by the petitioner, were honest and genuine.  Though the petitioner and the respondents are living separately from 11.7.1998 but essential parameter of the act of desertion, that is, animus deserendi is not proved by the petitioner against the respondent. On the other hand it seems from the material on record that the petitioner, who felt \"relieved\" when the respondent left on 11.7.1998, never wanted the respondent to come back and was waiting for two years period to get over to seek divorce on the ground of desertion. No inference on the basis of material on record can be drawn that the respondent ever intended to bring cohabitation permanently to an end. Thus, the ground of desertion has not been proved by the petitioner in the present case. The trial Court has not considered the evidence in proper perspective and as a result of which wrong conclusions on the point of desertion have been drawn. The finding of the trial Court that the respondent deserted the petitioner without any reasonable cause for two years preceding the presentation is, therefore, liable to be set aside as it is not supported from the evidence on record.\t [Para 29,30,31]"

When the legislature has used such wide expression as 'at the time of passing of any decree,' it encompasses within the expression all kinds of decrees such as restitution of conjugal rights under Section 9, judicial separation under Section 10, declaring marriage as null and void under Section 11, annulment of marriage as voidable under Section 12 and Divorce under Section 13.  [Para 18]\n\nIt is well known and recognized legal position that customary Hindu Law like Mohammedan Law permitted bigamous marriages which were prevalent in all Hindu families and more so in royal Hindu families. It is only after the Hindu Law was codified by enactments including the present Act that bar against bigamous marriages was created by Section 5(i) of the Act. Keeping into consideration the present state of the statutory Hindu Law, a bigamous marriage may be declared illegal being in contravention of the provisions of the Act but it cannot be said to be immoral so as to deny even the right of alimony or maintenance to a spouse financially weak and economically dependant. It is with the purpose of not rendering a financially dependant spouse destitute that Section 25 enables the court to award maintenance at the time of passing any type of decree resulting in breach in marriage relationship.  [Para 20]\n\nSection 25 is an enabling provision. It empowers the Court in a matrimonial case to consider facts and circumstances of the spouse applying and decide whether or not to grant permanent alimony or maintenance.  [Para 21]"

[Para 17]\n\nIt cannot be permitted to defendant to make charges and then get away by saying that the petitioner must prove that those charges are false.  That apart, the court is not concerned in such cases so much with the strict construction of the definitions of the concept \"proved\", \"not proved\" and \"disproved\". It is concerned with a matrimonial dispute where one party has already come to the court and alleged that the other party has indulged in a cruel behaviour and thereby caused agony to him and that the petitioner can no longer live with the other party. The defence of such a respondent cannot be to make further allegations against the petitioner and then to tell him that he or she must prove that those allegations are false. The moment such serious allegations are made in a written statement, the problem gets compounded.  It is undoubtedly true that when the petitioner approaches the court seeking divorce on certain grounds, the court has to consider as to what is the substance in his grievances and the burden of proving the allegations made by him in his petition is on him or her, but in a situation where the respondent comes not merely with a defence to the allegations made in the petition so as to continue the marriage but makes counter allegations against the petitioner, it would certainly be open to the petitioner to contend that those further allegations have caused cruelty to him or her and that the respondent must prove those allegations. That apart, it would also be open to him to contend that the moment such false allegations are made, one must look at them in the context of the matrimonial harmony and the question of continuation of marriage. The problem cannot be merely looked at as a problem of making allegations and counter-allegations and as to whose allegations are true or false. The moment such allegations are made in a written statement, it becomes clear that there is an irretrievable break down of the marriage. That would certainly be a factor to be considered while deciding the plea of cruelty raised by the petitioner.   [Para 28]\n\nIt is no use making allegations if one is not in a position to prove them and, the court is concerned with the consequence of such allegations on the other party whether they are proved or not.   [Para 28]\n\nWhen the petitioner husband as well as his mother both have deposed that the allegations of cruelty against them are/were false and they have caused them a severe agony it could not be said that they have taken those allegations in strides.  They could not be driven to amend the petition and then lead evidence thereafter. This will only mean prolonging the agony which both the parties are already undergoing.  It is no doubt true that as provided under section 23(1)(a) of the Hindu Marriage Act, one is not to be permitted to take advantage of his or her wrong, but that has got to be established, and unless established it cannot be contended that the petitioner is trying to take advantage of his own wrong.   [Para 28]\n\nWhen one party to the petition has sought divorce on some ground and the respondent to that petition does not merely defend it to get it defeated, but makes further serious allegations against the Petitioner, it becomes a clear step towards the dissolution of the marriage.As a normal rule whether cruelty as a matrimonial wrong has been established is a question of fact and in which case it will have to be determined by taking into account the particular individual's conduct and the circumstances of the case and there cannot be any general rule. At the same time, where the Petitioner makes the grievance of cruelty on the basis of some instances and fails to establish the same, but the respondent comes up with serious allegations (such as adultery, insanity or unchastity), and fails to prove the same, it will amount by itself to cruelty by the respondent. It will not be necessary in such case for the Petitioner to amend his petition in view of those allegations in the written statement and send him back to the Trial Court when on the face of it those allegations constitute cruelty and particularly when the respondent produces no credible evidence in support thereof.  [Para 28]\n\nIn the instant petition for divorce by husband, the respondent wife made serious allegations against the husband such as adultery in her written statement but failed to prove the same, though the onus lay upon her, the allegations were found to be false, baseless and constituted cruelty. Therefore, the petitioner husband was entitled to decree for divorce.\t\t\t [Para 31,32]"

Criminal P.C. (1973), S.125.\n\nIn the present case, the evidence adduced by the wife shows that although on the date of her marriage with the husband on 2-6-1978 the first marriage of the husband was subsisting, the first marriage of the husband had come to an end with the execution of Deed of Divorce dated 7-4-1980.  It was contended on behalf of the wife that since the husband has not led any evidence to establish the subsistence of his first marriage, her testimony as well as her tendering xerox copy of the divorce deed does neither conclusively establish the validity of the first marriage of the husband nor its dissolution.  Before the Family Court, no such issue was framed and there is no finding to that effect.  Moreover, the husband instead of rebutting the above contentions, has in fact chosen to make capital out of it.  Therefore, court proceeded on the footing that the first marriage of the husband was subsisting on 2-6-1978.  If the first marriage of the husband was subsisting on the date of the second marriage, then as per law and as per the judicial decisions of the Apex Court the second marriage is null and void.  But the question in the present case is, if the first marriage has come to an end by a Divorce deed dated 7-4-1980 and both the parties to the second marriage continue to live together as husband and wife after the dissolution of the first marriage, whether the second wife can be deprived of the status of a wife ? Even though the second marriage of the husband during the subsistence of the first marriage was null and void, on the dissolution of the first marriage, if the parties to the second marriage continued to live together as husband and wife, then there is no impediment in conferring the status of 'wife' to the second wife. In other words, even if the second marriage was null and void when solemnised on account of the subsistence of the first marriage of the husband, if the parties to the second marriage continue to live as husband and wife even after the divorce of the first marriage then the second wife would be entitled to the status of a wife and consequently has a right to claim maintenance.   [Para 16]\n\nWith the ever increasing matrimonial offences, time has come for the Parliament to have a fresh look and see whether the existing laws strike a balance in the matter of rights and obligations cast upon the husband and wife in preserving the sanctity of the sacred institution of marriage.  Luckily in the present case, the first marriage of the husband ended in a divorce, as a result whereof maintenance could be granted to the wife.  But in a given case, if the wife is an innocent victim and it is only after the marriage, she realises that the husband has cheated her by not disclosing the existence of a living spouse, should the wife be at the mercy of the husband and stay with him as a concubine ? Should there be no legislation granting some protection for her to live independently in a dignified way by seeking maintenance from the husband ? In a society where the marriage between a man and woman is considered to be sacred and supposed to last beyond the existence of the physical body and extend for generations, whether the existing legislations strike a balance in the matter of matrimonial offences committed by man or a woman?  It is for the legislature to consider and take appropriate measures.  AIR 1965 SC 1564 and AIR 1975 SC 83 - Referred to.\t [Para 18]"

Cruelty may be physical or corporeal or may be mental. In physical cruelty, there can be tangible and direct evidence, but in the case of mental cruelty there may not at the same time be direct evidence. In cases where there is no direct evidence, Courts are required to probe into the mental process and mental effect of incidents that are brought out in evidence. It is in this view that one has to consider the evidence in matrimonial disputes.   [Para 9]"

Even assuming that the provision extends to both petitioner as well as the respondent it does not vest any absolute right in the petitioner or the respondent not to make any attempt for cohabitation with the other party after the decree for judicial separation has been passed. As the provision clearly provides the decree for judicial separation is not final in the sense that it is irreversible; power is vested in the Court to rescind the decree if it considers it just and reasonable to do so on an application by either party. The effect of the decree is that certain mutual rights and obligations arising from the marriage are as it were suspended and the rights and duties prescribed in the decree are substituted therefor. The decree for judicial separation does not sever or dissolve the marriage tie which continues to subsist. It affords an opportunity to the spouse for reconciliation and readjustment. The decree may fall by a conciliation of the parties in which case the rights of respective parties which float from the marriage and were suspended are restored. Therefore the impression that Section 10(2) vests a right in the petitioner to get the decree of divorce notwithstanding the fact that he has not made any attempt for cohabitation with the respondent and has even acted in a manner to thwart any move for cohabitation does not flow from a reasonable interpretation of the statutory provisions.\t\t [Para 17]"

In that view of the matter accepting the contention raised on behalf of the appellant would, defeat the very purpose of passing the decree for judicial separation. The decision of the Gujarat High Court in AIR 1979 Guj. 209 does not lay down the correct position of law. On the other hand the decision of the Madras High Court in the case of Soundarammal v. Sundara Mahalinga Nadar, AIR 1980 Madras 294, in which a single Judge took the view that the husband who continued to live in adultery even after decree at the instance of wife could not succeed in petition seeking decree for divorce and that Section 23(1)(a) barred the relief, has our approval.

A Hindu wife removes her Mangalsutra only after the death of her husband. But here we are not concerned with a case where a wife after tearing her Mangalsutra threw at her husband and walked out of her husband's house. Here is a case where a wife while in privacy, occasionally has been removing her Mangalsutra and bangles on asking of her husband with a view to please him. If the removal of Mangalsutra was something wrong amounting to mental cruelty, as submitted by learned counsel for the appellant, it was the husband who instigated his wife to commit that wrong and thus was an abettor. Under such circumstances the appellant cannot be allowed to take advantage of a wrong done by his wife for which he himself was responsible. In such a case the appellant cannot be allowed to complain that his wife is guilty of committing an act of mental cruelty upon him, and further by such an act, has suffered mental pain and agony as a result of which married life has broken down, and he is not expected to live with his wife. It also appears to us that, whenever the appellant asked her wife for removal of her Mangalsutra, the respondent never comprehended that her husband at any point of time would react to such occurrences in the way he did. Under such circumstances, the appellant was not expected to have made an issue out of it. We are, therefore, of the view that removal of Mangalsutra by the respondent would not constitute mental cruelty within the meaning of Section 13(1)(ia) of the Act.  [Para 8]"

We also find that if the wife had any intention to use copies of those letters she would have filed the same before the trial Court. Excepting filing a counter-affidavit the respondent-wife did not file any copy of the letters sent to her husband, whereas the husband has filed all the letters sent to him by his wife in the Court which were exhibited. The respondent-wife in her testimony stated that she wrote several letters to her husband, but her husband did not reply any of them and as such she started preserving the copies of the letters sent by her to her husband. This act of the respondent, according to us, is a most natural behaviour of human being placed in such circumstances. Thus, we find mere preserving the copies of the letters by the wife does not constitute an act which amounts to mental cruelty, and as a result of which it becomes impossible for the husband to live with his wife.

Desertion, as a ground for divorce, was inserted to Section 13 by Act 68/1976. Prior to the amendment it was only a ground for judicial separation.\n\nFor the offence of desertion so far as the deserting spouse is concerned, two essential conditions must be there (1) the factum of separation, and (2) the intention to bring cohabitation permanently to an end (animus deserendi). Similarly two elements are essential so far as the deserted spouse is concerned: (1) the absence of consent, and (2) absence of conduct giving reasonable cause to the spouse leaving the matrimonial home to form the necessary intention aforesaid. For holding desertion as proved the inference may be drawn from certain facts which may not in another case be capable of leading to the same inference; that is to say the facts have to be viewed as to the purpose which is revealed by those acts or by conduct and expression of intention, both anterior and subsequent to the actual acts of separation.

It varies from individual to individual, from society to society and also depends on the status of the persons. What would be a mental cruelty in the life of two individuals belonging to particular strata of the society may not amount to mental cruelty in respect of another couple belonging to a different stratum of society. The agonized feeling or for that matter a sense of disappointment can take place by certain acts causing a grievous dent at the mental level. The inference has to be drawn from the attending circumstances. In this case allegations were made against him which were not correct; his relatives were dragged into the matrimonial controversy, the assertions in the written statement depict him as if he had tacitly conceded to have harboured notions of gender insensitivity or some kind of male chauvinism, his parents and he are ignored in the naming ceremony of the son, and he come to learn from others that the wife had gone to Gulbarga to prosecute her studies. That apart, the communications, after the decree for restitution of conjugal rights, indicate the attitude of the wife as if she is playing a game of Chess. The launching of criminal prosecution can be perceived from the spectrum of conduct. The learned Magistrate has recorded the judgment of acquittal. The wife had preferred an appeal before the High Court after obtaining leave. After the State Government prefers an appeal in the Court of Session, she chooses to withdraw the appeal. But she intends, as the pleadings would show, that the case should reach the logical conclusion. The sanguine concept of marriage presumably has become illusory and it would not be inapposite to say that the wife has shown anaemic emotional disposition to the husband. Therefore, the decree of divorce granted by the High Court deserves to be affirmed singularly on the ground of mental cruelty.           [Para 37,38]"

But all these elements are questions of fact. The circumstances that the deserting spouse has physically stayed away from the matrimonial home; that there is absence of consent for such stay from the deserted spouse; that there is a failure to substantiate any reason for such stay; and that there is a clear omission to demonstrate readiness and willingness to discharge the continuing obligation to return to the matrimonial home, taken together, may be sufficient to draw a conclusion that there was an animus deserendi and the same was without a reasonable cause. Once such desertion is established, there is no obligation on the deserted spouse to appeal to the deserting spouse to change his or her mind or actually take steps to effect a reconciliation or bring the deserting spouse back to the matrimonial home.

In every condonation there is an implied condition that the excused spouse will not repeat or commit matrimonial wrongs in future. No wrong is permanently wiped out by condonation; but is only hibernated. The reunion of spouses for a temporary period during the pendency of the proceeding for divorce pursuant to settlement of matrimonial issues will not defeat the claim for dissolution of marriage on the ground of alleged condonation of cruelty nor will it bar continuance of the proceeding when their relationship is again estranged. The alleged condonation can put an end to the proceeding only when the complaining spouse has led a normal and intimate life uninfluenced by the conduct of the offending spouse, in such a manner that the wronged spouse has pardoned and restored the offending spouse to the original status. Nothing of that sort happened in present case. The reunion lasted only for a temporary period and the spouses failed to carry on a normal and harmonious life. Therefore, the plea raised by the learned counsel for the respondent for dismissal of the original petition on the ground of alleged condonation of cruelty is liable only to be refused.\t(Paras 24, 25)"

                ],
                "description": "Appeal in matrimonial cases - Period of limitation - S.19(3) of Family Courts Act provides for limiting period of 30 days - Whereas by virtue of 2003 Amendment, limiting period in Hindu Marriage Act raised to 90 days - Held, limitation of 90 days would apply considering object of 2003 Amendment - No need to invoke non obstante provision under Family Courts Act as there is no direct conflict between two statutes.\n\nThe provisions of Section 28 (4) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 came to be amended in the year 2003 consequent to the suggestion given by the Apex Court in Savitri Pandey's case [AIR 2002 SC 591]. Therefore, the purpose and object behind amending the said Act is required to be considered. While amending the provisions, the Parliament was aware of the existence of the provisions under Family Courts Act, 1984. It is presumed that the Parliament was conscious of the existence of another statute relating to the subject, prescribing forum and procedure and period of limitation. Therefore, a harmonious interpretation which would advance the object and purpose of the legislation will have to be adopted.\n\nAs the Act of 1955 was amended by the Parliament in the year 2003, in that sense, the period of limitation of ninety days was prescribed by a later law which would override the provisions relating to period of limitation prescribed in the earlier enactment i.e. Act of 1984. The substantive provision of law was amended at a later stage and the same shall prevail being later in point of time.\n\nEven if both the Acts are considered on certain subjects and situations to be special and general, even then, as a matter of sound interpretation and keeping in view the purpose for providing a larger period of limitation, it must be construed that the appeals arising out of the judgment and orders passed by the Family Court shall be governed by a larger period of limitation prescribed under Section 28(4) of the Act of 1955. Any contrary interpretation would frustrate the very object of the enactment which was made on the suggestion of the Apex Court in the case of Savitri Pandey.\n\nIt needs to be considered that we are a country of vast population, millions of people face financial hardship for litigating a matter, people have to spend considerable amount of time, money and energy. The geographical conditions further make easy access to justice difficult and taking into consideration all these circumstances, coupled with the peculiar situation faced by the parties while litigating matrimonial, family related issues, Apex Court made certain observations in the case of Savitri Pandey which suggestion was accepted by the Parliament and accordingly the law was amended.\n\nIf the two statutes are construed and understood in its proper sense, then there is no conflict between the two laws and, therefore, no question arises of invoking non obstante provision in Section 20 of the Act of 1984. The enactment of the Act of 1984 or non obstante provision in Section 20 is not intended to impliedly repeal provisions made in the Act of 1955. The Act of 1984 provides for a special forum relating to matrimonial disputes and with that view, special procedure was devised for expeditious adjudication of the cases. It is in that context the non obstante provision of Section 20 is required to be construed.\n\nIt would also not be appropriate to apply different period of limitation, one in case of orders passed by the Family Courts and in another by the regular Civil Courts. Such an approach would frustrate very purpose of legislation. For the reasons stated above, for an appeal filed under sub-section (1) of Section 19 of the Family Courts Act, 1984, period of limitation prescribed under sub-section (4) of Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 shall apply. 2002(3) ALL MR 250 (S.C.)

                "description": "Proceedings for divorce - Ground of desertion - What must be proved by the petitioner.\n\n\"Desertion\" in the context of matrimonial law represents a legal conception. It is difficult to give a comprehensive definition of the term. The essential ingredients of this offence in order that it may furnish a ground for relief are:\n\n1. The factum of separation\n\n2. The intention to bring cohabitation permanently to an end - animus deserendi;\n\n3. The element of permanence which is a prime condition requires that both these essential ingredients  should continue during the entire statutory period;\n\nThe clause lays down the rule that desertion to amount to a matrimonial offence must be for a continuous period of not less than two years immediately preceding the presentation of the petition. This clause has to be read with the Explanation. The Explanation has widened the definition of desertion to include 'wilful neglect' of the petitioning spouse by the respondent. It states that to amount to a matrimonial offence desertion must be without reasonable cause and without the consent or against the wish of the petitioner. From the Explanation it is abundantly clear that the legislature intended to give to the expression a wide import which includes wilful neglect of the petitioner by the other party to the marriage. Therefore, for the offence of desertion, so far as the deserting spouse is concerned, two essential conditions must be there, namely, (1) the factum of separation, and (2) the intention to bring cohabitation permanently to an end (animus deserendi). Similarly, two elements are essential so far as the deserted spouse is concerned: (1) the absence of consent, and (2) absence of conduct giving reasonable cause to the spouse leaving the matrimonial home to form the necessary intention aforesaid. The petitioner for divorce bears the burden of proving those elements in the two spouses respectively and their continuance throughout the statutory period. [Para 6]"

In the meantime, father of the appellant expired some time in 1988, putting an end to the so-called reason of misbehaviour of her father-in-law. There is nothing on record that thereafter she expressed her desire to join her husband at the matrimonial home. The appellant is the only son of his parents and as expected, he was not willing to establish a separate residence leaving his parents to live alone in their old age. The cumulative effect of the circumstances and the conduct of the respondent is that she had given expression of animus deserendi. Thus, the two ingredients of the matrimonial offence of desertion i.e. separation in fact and animus deserendi have been established by the appellant. The finding recorded by the High Court that the wife was not guilty of deserting her husband cannot be sustained. The failure on the part of the wife to substantiate a  serious allegation of infamous conduct of indecent advances said to have been made to her by the father-in-law, taken together with the absence and omission from her side to demonstrate her readiness and willingness to discharge her continuing obligation to return to the matrimonial home, establish sufficiently the animus deserendi, necessary to prove legal desertion as required under section 13(1) (ib). The conduct of the wife seems to be more indicative of a firm determination not to return to the marital home and discharge the obligations attendant thereto. Therefore, the judgment of the High Court is unsustainable and has to be set aside.\t\t [Para 12]"

'Cruelty' is not defined in the Act. Some of the provisions of the Hindu Marriage Act were amended by Hindu Marriage Laws (Amendment) Act, 1976. Prior to the amendment, 'cruelty' was one of the grounds for Judicial separation under Section 10 of the Act. Under that Section, \"cruelty\" was given an extended meaning by using an adjectival phrase, viz. \"as to cause reasonable apprehension in the mind of the petitioner that it will be harmful or injurious for the petitioner to live with the other party.\"\t [Para 9]\n\nThe omission of the words, which described 'cruelty' in the unamended Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act, has some significance in the sense that it is not necessary to prove that the nature of the cruelty is such as to cause reasonable apprehension in the mind of the petitioner that it would be harmful for the petitioner to live with the other party. English Courts in some of the earlier decisions had attempted to define \"cruelty\" as an act which involves conduct of such a nature as to have caused damage to life, limb or health or to give rise to reasonable apprehension of such danger. But we do not think that such a degree of cruelty is required to be proved by the petitioner for obtaining a decree for divorce. Cruelty can be said to be an act committed with the intention to cause suffering to the opposite party. Austerity of temper, rudeness of language, occasional outburst of anger, may not amount to cruelty, though it may amount to misconduct.\t [Para 10]"

Mental cruelty is a state of mind and feeling with one of the spouses due to the behaviour or behavioral pattern by the other. Unlike the case of physical cruelty the mental cruelty is difficult to establish by direct evidence. It is necessarily a matter of inference to be drawn from the facts and circumstances of the case. A feeling of anguish, disappointment and frustration in one spouse caused by the conduct of the other can only be appreciated on assessing the attending facts and circumstances in which the two partners of matrimonial life have been living. The inference has to be drawn from the attending facts and circumstances taken cumulatively. In case of mental cruelty it will not be a correct approach to take an instance of misbehavior in isolation and then pose the question whether such behaviour is sufficient by itself to cause mental cruelty. The approach should be to take the cumulative effect of the facts and circumstances emerging from the evidence on record and then draw a fair inference whether the petitioner in the divorce petition has been subjected to mental cruelty due to conduct of the other.

The appellant even refused to subject herself to medical test as advised by the doctor. After 21st June, 1987 she stayed away from the matrimonial home and the respondent was deprived of her company. In such circumstances, the respondent who was enjoying normal health was likely to feel a sense of anguish and frustration in being deprived of normal cohabitation that every married person expects to enjoy and also social embarrassment due to the behaviour of the appellant. Further, the conduct of the appellant in approaching the police complaining against her husband and his parents and in not accepting the advice of the superior judicial officer and taking a false plea in the case that she had conceived but unfortunately there was miscarriage are bound to cause a sense of mental depression in the respondent. The cumulative effect of all these on the mind of the respondent, in our considered view, amounts to mental cruelty caused due to the stubborn attitude and inexplicably unreasonable conduct of the appellant.

Cruelty can be physical or mental. Cruelty which is a ground for dissolution of marriage may be defined as willful and unjustifiable conduct of such character as to cause danger to life, limb or health, bodily or mental, or as to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of such a danger. The question of mental cruelty has to be considered in the light of the norms of marital ties of the particular society to which the parties belong, their social values, status, environment in which they live. Cruelty, as noted above, includes mental cruelty, which falls within the purview of a matrimonial wrong. Cruelty need not be physical. If from the conduct of his spouse same is established and/or an inference can be legitimately drawn that the treatment of the spouse is such that it causes an apprehension in the mind of the other spouse, about his or her mental welfare then this conduct amounts to cruelty. In delicate human relationship like matrimony, one has to see the probabilities of the case. The concept, a proof beyond the shadow of doubt, is to be applied to criminal trials and not to civil matters and certainly not to matters of such delicate personal relationship as those of husband and wife. Therefore, one has to see what are the probabilities in a case and legal cruelty has to be found out, not merely as a matter of fact, but as the effect on the mind of the complainant spouse because of the acts or omissions of the other. Cruelty may be physical or corporeal or may be mental. In physical cruelty, there can be tangible and direct evidence, but in the case of mental cruelty there may not at the same time be direct evidence. In cases where there is no direct evidence, Courts are required to probe into the mental process and mental effect of incidents that are brought out in evidence. It is in this view that one has to consider the evidence in matrimonial disputes.   [Para 10]"

The cruelty may be mental or physical, intentional or unintentional. If it is physical, the Court will have no problem in determining it. It is a question of fact and degree.

Ultimately, it is a matter of inference to be drawn by taking into account the nature of the conduct and its effect on the complaining spouse. However, there may be a case where the conduct complained of itself is bad enough and per se unlawful or illegal. Then the impact or injurious effect on the other spouse need not be enquired into or considered. In such cases, the cruelty will be established if the conduct itself is proved or admitted.

It must be something more serious than 'ordinary wear and tear of married life'. The conduct, taking into consideration the circumstances and background has to be examined to reach the conclusion whether the conduct complained of amounts to cruelty in the matrimonial law. Conduct has to be considered, as noted above, in the background of several factors such as social status of parties, their education, physical and mental conditions, customs and traditions. It is difficult to lay down a precise definition or to give exhaustive description of the circumstances, which would constitute cruelty. It must be of the type as to satisfy the conscience of the Court that the relationship between the parties had deteriorated to such an extent due to the conduct of the other spouse that it would be impossible for them to live together without mental agony, torture or distress, to entitle the complaining spouse to secure divorce. Physical violence is not absolutely essential to constitute cruelty and a consistent course of conduct inflicting immeasurable mental agony and torture may well constitute cruelty within the meaning of Section 10 of the Act. Mental cruelty may consist of verbal abuses and insults by using filthy and abusive language leading to constant disturbance of mental peace of the other party. The Court dealing with the petition for divorce on the ground of cruelty has to bear in mind that the problems before it are those of human beings and the psychological changes in a spouse's conduct have to be borne in mind before disposing of the petition for divorce. However, insignificant or trifling, such conduct may cause pain in the mind of another. But before the conduct can be called cruelty, it must touch a certain pitch of severity. It is for the Court to weigh the gravity. It has to be seen whether the conduct was such that no reasonable person would tolerate. It has to be considered whether the complainant should be called upon to endure as a part of normal human life. Every matrimonial conduct, which may cause annoyance to the other, may not amount to cruelty. Mere trivial irritations, quarrels between spouses, which happen in day-to-day married life, may also not amount to cruelty. Cruelty in matrimonial life may be of unfounded  variety, which can be subtle or brutal. It may be words, gestures or by mere silence, violent or non-violent.   [Para 12,13]"

For example in her evidence respondent clearly accepted that she had said five things to be followed by him. Surprisingly, most of them related to ladies working in the hospital. Though respondent tried to show that they were simple and harmless advice, yet on a bare reading thereof it was clear that there were clear manifestations of her suspecting the husband's fidelity, character and reputation. By way of illustration, it may be indicated that the first so called advice was not to ask certain female staff members to come and work on off-duty hours when nobody else was available in the hospital. Second was not to work behind the closed doors with certain members of the staff. Contrary to what she had stated about having full faith in her husband, the so called advices were nothing but casting doubt on the reputation, character and fidelity of her husband. Constant nagging on those aspects, certainly amounted to causing indelible mental agony and amounted cruelty. The respondent was not an ordinary woman. She was a doctor in the hospital and knew the importance of the nature of duty and the necessity of members of the staff working even during off hours and the working conditions. Further after filing of the divorce petition a suit for injunction was filed, and the respondent went to the extent of seeking detention of the appellant husband for alleged disobedience of order of injunction. She filed a petition for maintenance which was also dismissed. Several caveat petitions were lodged with wrong address. The respondent in her evidence clearly accepted that she intended to proceed with the execution proceedings, and prayer for arrest till the divorce case was finalized. When the respondent gives priority to her profession over her husband's freedom it points unerringly at disharmony, diffusion and disintegration of marital unity, from which the Court can deduce about irretrievable breaking of marriage. Although irretrievable breaking of marriage is not one of the statutory grounds on which Court can direct dissolution of marriage, with a view to do complete justice and shorten the agony of parties, Appellant was granted a decree of divorce.

There cannot be any allergy to look into such material, provided it has a reasonable nexus and credibility.  It is true that one has to be careful in looking and evaluating such material.  The essence of judicial approach is objectivity, exclusion of extraneous matters from consideration and observance of rules of natural justice.\t\t\t [Para 21]\n\nIn view of this position, the Respondent husband cannot be denied the opportunity of submitting that the learned Judge was wrong in not looking into the fact that a Complaint under S.498-A, IPC had been filed leading to his harassment. It is a relevant factor in considering the plea of cruelty.  The aloofness of the Appellant and not having the physical relations coupled with a rude behaviour and filing of Complaint under Section 498-A of Indian Penal Code will have to be all considered together.  On the other hand, the Respondent tried his level best for a reconciliation after the Appellant walked out of his house in February, 1994.  He went to a social institution for intervention.  That having failed, also he waited for good time and the present proceeding was filed nearly one year thereafter i.e. on 15th January, 1995.  As far as the Appellant is concerned, she did not file any proceeding for restitution of conjugal rights.  On the other hand, she chose to file a Complaint under Section 498-A which was found to be false and came to be dismissed.  The effect of all these factors will have to be considered together.\t\t\t\t\t [Para 22]\n\nThe case for divorce under Section 13(1)(ia) of the said Act was, therefore, made out.

The said complaint has not yet been decided and is still pending. When the said case is pending before the competent court, the learned trial Judge should not have given so much weightage about the factum of filing of such complaint and trying to find out as to whether the allegations in the said complaint are correct or not. If ultimately the said complaint is dismissed, naturally one can presume that the wife is guilty of filing false cases and making reckless allegations against the husband. When the Act permits the wife to approach the Court under the provisions of Domestic Violence Act and if that remedy is availed of, such act should not be treated as an act of cruelty, otherwise in no case a lady can file any complaint, if the filing of complaint is to be treated as an act of cruelty. Simply because the wife in her cross-examination admitted that she did not want to live an animal life and that she is not interested in marital life, one cannot jump to a conclusion that the wife is at wrong. A wife is also entitled to have her own freedom after marriage. In the instant case, even during the time of pregnancy, she was serving and was required to do household work after coming from the office. It is the case of the appellant that she was never treated as a family member of the respondent or her in-laws. The allegation regarding strangulation made by the appellant against the father-in-law is the subject matter of case under the Domestic Violence Act. The trial Judge has gravely erred in coming to the conclusion that since there is no police complaint filed by her or medical report regarding strangulation and that being a serious allegation, the genuineness of the said case cannot be believed. Whether the allegation is false or not is a matter of investigation before other competent court. The trial Judge has erred in holding that if the appellant was subjected to inhuman treatment being an educated lady she would file police complaint and would go for medical examination for herself.

It is too much to hold that out of jealousy perhaps such reckless allegations have been made. In such type of matters, there may not be any independent witnesses present but the appellant can be said to be the best witness because the wife is required to spend more time and is required to know details of the husband more minutely than anyone else in the family. The trial Judge has also found on appreciation of evidence that the allegation of the respondent that the parents wanted a ghar jamai is false. The trial Judge also found that lodging a complaint with Stree Adhar Kendra by the appellant does not mean that the respondent and his family members are defamed. The Judge also held that a woman look for various sources or women organisations to seek support and resolve their disputes. The trial judge has erred in going in detail about the complaint filed under the Domestic Violence Act for coming to the conclusion that there is a contradiction in the allegations of the appellant in her complaint under the Act and her admission in the cross-examination. In para 58 of the order, the trial Judge found that there are allegations and counter allegations but the submission of the advocate for the respondent is corroborated by the allegations made by the appellant in her complaint under the Domestic Violence Act. It is required to be noted that in spite of the aforesaid fact the appellant, in order to save her matrimonial home as well as for the benefit of their daughter has submitted that she is willing to go and reside with the husband and she is even ready to tolerate his relationship with other lady. It may not amount to an act of cruelty which can be attributed to the wife. In a given case, if the circumstances so warrant, wife may have some suspicion about the act and behaviour of her husband. In a given case, if the wife is having some suspicion, that itself may not amount to an act of cruelty as the act of cruelty depends upon the facts and circumstances of each and every case. In a given case if ill-treatment is meted out by in-laws and when the law has provided remedy, there is nothing wrong if a complaint to that effect is filed even against in-laws.

It is his case that there is a failure of marriage and he seeks to point it out by invoking a ground available under the law. The respondent, in order to oppose the prayer for divorce, made a counter allegation in the written statement which would clearly show a failure of the marriage. Parties have led their evidence on the allegations made by them in their pleadings. Insofar as the allegations made by the appellant in her written statement are concerned, at no point of time before filing the complaint under section 498-A, were made against the respondent or his family members. The appellant started making such allegations only after the respondent filed the petition for divorce on the ground of cruelty. If these allegations were true, neither the appellant nor her father would have kept quite for such a long time. The Judge was right in coming to the conclusion that these allegations were baseless and false. He was, therefore, right in granting the decree of divorce on the ground of cruelty. Even if it is assumed that the allegations made by the appellant in her written statement cannot be relied upon to hold that they constitute cruelty. The allegations made by the respondents in the petition and in his evidence are also sufficient to hold that the ground of cruelty has been proved. The conduct of the appellant clearly shows that she had made the life of the respondent and his family members miserable. The manner in which she used to lodge criminal complaints one after another against the respondent undoubtedly would constitute mental cruelty.

In a given case, if the husband and wife apply for mutual divorce, that stands on a different footing but if one of the spouses is not willing to give consent divorce, then only statutory grounds available in the Act are required to be considered by the Court of law and to find out as to whether any such grounds exist for dissolving the marriage as provided by law.  [Para 23]\n\nThe institution of marriage occupies an important place and plays an important role in the society in general and, therefore, it would not be appropriate to apply the doctrine of irretrievable breakdown of marriage as a straitjacket formula for dissolving the marriage. This aspect has to be considered in the background of other facts and circumstances of the case. The sanctity of marriage cannot be left at the whims of one of the annoying spouses. Irretrievable breakdown of marriage is not a ground by itself to dissolve the marriage. It is only in extreme circumstances that the court may use this ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage of divorce. Marriage results in unity of marital relation between husband and wife. Even otherwise, the powers of the Supreme Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India are different and, therefore, the decision of the Supreme Court under Article 142 of the Constitution of India cannot be straightaway made applicable so far as proceedings before the High Courts are concerned, as the High Court in an appeal is required to find out as to whether any statutory ground is available for passing a decree of divorce. In any event of the matter, this Court while considering the case as to whether divorce should be granted or not is required to consider the statutory grounds provided under Section 13 of the Act. The Act is enacted keeping in view the social, economic and political changes in the Country. The Act brings about a number of important changes in the field of Hindu marriage and divorce law in the country. Cruelty has been made a ground for divorce as well as judicial separation. The Legislature has provided decree of dissolution of marriage by way of mutual consent under Section 13-B of the Act. However, if either side is not willing to give any consent, the Court is required to see the statutory ground available as provided under Section 13 of the Act for dissolving the marriage.

A marriage in contravention of this condition, therefore, is null and void. By reason of the overriding effect of the Marriage Act as mentioned in section 4, no aid can be taken of the earlier Hindu law or any custom or usage as a part of that law inconsistent with any provision of the Act. So far as Section 12 is concerned, it is confined to other categories of marriages and is not applicable to one solemnised in violation of Section 5(i) of the Act. Sub-section (2) of Section 12 puts further restrictions on such a right. The cases covered by this section are not void ab initio, and unless all the conditions mentioned therein are fulfilled and the aggrieved party exercises the right to avoid it, the same continues to be effective. The marriages covered by Section 11 are void ipso jure, that is, void from the very inception, and have to be ignored as not existing in law at all if and when such a question arises. Although the section permits a formal declaration to be made on the presentation of a petition, it is not essential to obtain in advance such a formal declaration from a court in a proceeding specifically commenced for the purpose. Sub-section (1) of S.16, clearly implies that a void marriage can be held to be so without a prior formal declaration by a court in a proceeding. While dealing with cases covered by Section 12, sub-section (2) refers to a decree of nullity as an essential condition and sub-section (3) prominently brings out the basic difference in the character of void and voidable marriages as covered respectively by Sections 11 and 12. It is also to be seen that while the legislature has considered it advisable to uphold the legitimacy of the paternity of a child born out of a void marriage, it has not extended a similar protection in respect of the mother of the child. The marriage of the appellant/ must, therefore, be treated as null and void from its very inception.   [Para 11]"

Even after passing a decree, the Court can issue a direction that the decree shall be executed in the manner provided in Rule 33. In such event, under Sub-rule 2 of Rule 33, the Court has power to direct that in the event the decree not being obeyed within such a period as may be fixed in this behalf, the judgment-debtor shall make to the decree-holder such periodical payments as may be just. In a given case the Court may require the judgment-debtor to secure to the decree-holder such periodical payments. As distinguished from Sub-rule 1 of Rule 32, willful disobedience is not a condition precedent for passing an order under Sub-Rule 2 of Order 33 directing the judgment-debtor to make periodical payments to the decree-holder. The Court gets power when it is found that the decree has not been complied with within such period as may be fixed in this behalf. The power can be exercised under Sub-rule 2 of Rule 33 once the Executing Court finds that the decree is not obeyed within the period as may be fixed in that behalf. The provision of Sub-rule 1 of Rule 33 requires that the Court passing a decree should issue a direction at any time after passing a decree that the decree shall be executed in the manner provided in the Rule. Sub-rule 2 of Rule 33 provides that where the Court has made an order under Sub-Rule 1 that the decree shall be executed in the manner provided in Rule 33, it may order that in the event of the decree not being obeyed within such period as may be fixed in this behalf, the judgment-debtor shall make periodical payments as may be just. Thus, the power under Sub-rule 1 of Rule 33 of Order 21 of the said Code directing that the decree shall be executed in the manner provided under Rule 33 is of the Court passing the decree. The power under Sub-Rule 2 of Rule 33 is to be exercised by the Court in execution. Sub-rule 4 of Rule 33 provides that periodical payments ordered to be made under Sub-Rule 2 of Rule 33 may be recovered as if the same is payable under a decree for payment of money. The effect of Sub-rule 4 is that if the judgment-debtor fails to make periodical payments, as ordered under Sub-rule 2 of Rule 33, the said direction can be executed as if it is a money decree.

                "description": "Decree for restitution of conjugal rights - Jurisdiction of Court passing the decree - Court gets jurisdiction to pass direction for periodical payments when the judgment-debtor fails to obey the decree within time limit provided.\n\nThe Court gets power to pass a direction against judgment-debtor to make periodical payment in the event the decree is not obeyed within such time as may be fixed in this behalf. Therefore, while passing an order in terms of Sub-rule 2 of Rule 33, of fixing the date from which the periodical payment is payable, the Court will have to consider all the facts and circumstances and conduct of the parties. At the same time, it must be noted that it is not necessary for the wife (decree-holder) to establish that there is willful disobedience of the decree on the part of husband-judgment debtor. The Court gets jurisdiction to pass a direction for periodical payments when the judgment-debtor fails to obey the decree within time limit provided. In a given case where time limit is provided while passing a decree and if there is non-compliance, there may be some justification for passing a direction against the judgment-debtor to make periodical payments from the date of passing the decree. In a given case, a direction may be issued to make such periodical payments from the date on which period provided for compliance of the decree is over. No hard and fast rule can be laid down in that behalf. As far as quantum of amount is concerned, it must be remembered that the Court can exercise the power under Sub-rule 2 of Rule 33 only if the husband-judgment debtor fails to comply with the decree of restitution of conjugal rights. In a way this is a provision to compensate the wife-decree holder on account of non compliance of the decree for restitution of conjugal rights by the husband and, therefore, it is not possible to accept the argument that periodical payment contemplated by sub-rule 2 is in the nature of penalty. If a decree for restitution of conjugal rights would have been implemented, a wife could have enjoyed the benefit of the status of her husband in terms of the standard of living of the husband, life style of the husband and other material aspects of the life. If the object of directing periodical payments to be made by the husband-judgment debtor is considered, the amount which is made payable under the said sub-rule 2 cannot exceed the maintenance or the alimony which may be payable to the wife in accordance with section 24 or section 25 of the said Act. Therefore, while determining the amount, the Executing Court has to apply the same yardsticks which are normally applied when the amount of maintenance is determined under the provisions of said Act. As stated earlier, the argument that the amount is in the nature of penalty has to be discarded as there is no requirement of law that before the power under Sub-rule 2 of Rule 33 is exercised, it is necessary to establish willful disobedience on the part of the husband. What is required to be established is the fact that the husband has not obeyed the decree within the time fixed for compliance thereof.  [Para 6,7]"

The cruelty can be physical or mental.  Cruelty which is a ground for dissolution of marriage can be defined as willful or unjustifiable of such character as to cause danger to life, limb or health, bodily or mentally, or as to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of such a danger.

The deserting spouse must be shown to have persisted in the intention to desert throughout the whole period.  In fulfilling its duty of determining whether on the evidence a case of desertion without any cause has been proved by the Court ought not to leave out of account the attitude of mind of the petitioner.  If on the facts it appears that a husband has made it plain to his deserting wife that he will not receive her back, or if he has repelled all the advances which she may have made towards a resumption of married life, he cannot complain that she has persisted without cause in her desertion.  In other words, in so far as deserting spouse is concerned, two essential conditions must exist, namely, the factum of separation, and the intention to bring co-habitation permanently to an end (animus deserendi).  Similarly, two elements are essential so far as deserted spouse is concerned, namely, the absence of consent, and absence of conduct giving reasonable cause to the spouse leaving matrimonial home to form the necessary intention to bring co-habitation permanently to an end.

The instances indicated in the succeeding paragraphs are only illustrative and not exhaustive.\n\n(i)\tOn consideration of complete matrimonial life of the parties, acute mental pain, agony and suffering as would not make possible for the parties to live with each other could come within the broad parameters of mental cruelty.\n\n(ii)\tOn comprehensive appraisal of the entire matrimonial life of the parties, it becomes abundantly clear that situation is such that the wronged party cannot reasonably be asked to put up with such conduct and continue to live with other party.\n\n(iii)\tMere coldness or lack of affection cannot amount to cruelty, frequent rudeness of language, petulance of manner, indifference and neglect may reach such a degree that it makes the married life for the other spouse absolutely intolerable.\n\n(iv)\tMental cruelty is a state of mind. The feeling of deep anguish, disappointment, frustration in one spouse caused by the conduct of other for a long time may lead to mental cruelty.\n\n(vi)\tSustained unjustifiable conduct and behaviour of one spouse actually affecting physical and mental health of the other spouse. The treatment complained of and the resultant danger or apprehension must be very grave, substantial and weighty.\n\n(viii)\tThe conduct must be much more than jealousy, selfishness, possessiveness, which causes unhappiness and dissatisfaction and emotional upset may not be a ground for grant of divorce on the ground of mental cruelty.\n\n(ix)\tMere trivial irritations, quarrels, normal wear and tear of the married life which happens in day to day life would not be adequate for grant of divorce on the ground of mental cruelty.\n\n(x)\tThe married life should be reviewed as a whole and a few isolated instances over a period of years will not amount to cruelty. The ill-conduct must be persistent for a fairly lengthy period, where the relationship has deteriorated to an extent that because of the acts and behaviour of a spouse, the wronged party finds it extremely difficult to live with the other party any longer, may amount to mental cruelty.\n\n(xi)\tIf a husband submits himself for an operation of sterilization without medical reasons and without the consent or knowledge of his wife and similarly if the wife undergoes vasectomy or abortion without medical reason or without the consent or knowledge of her husband, such an act of the spouse may lead to mental cruelty.\n\n(xii)\tUnilateral decision of refusal to have intercourse for considerable period without there being any physical incapacity or valid reason may amount to mental cruelty.\n\n(xiii)\tUnilateral decision of either husband or wife after marriage not to have child from the marriage may amount to cruelty.\n\n(xiv)\tWhere there has been a long period of continuous separation, it may fairly be concluded that the matrimonial bond is beyond repair. The marriage becomes a fiction though supported by a legal tie. By refusing to sever that tie, the law in such cases, does not serve the sanctity of marriage; on the contrary, it shows scant regard for the feelings and emotions of the parties. In such like situations, it may lead to mental cruelty. \t\t\t\t\t [Para 89]"

As is discernible from its plain language, sub-section (1) of Section 13-B of the Act enables the Court to grant divorce by mutual consent only when it is satisfied that :- (i) the marriage had been solemnized between the parties; (ii) the parties have been living separately for more than one year before presenting the petition; (iii) they were not able to live together at the time of presenting the petition and continued to live separately; (iv) they had mutually agreed to dissolve the marriage before or at the time the petition was presented; and (v) the contents of the petition are true and factually correct. However, irrespective of existence of the above-stated grounds, sub-section (2) of Section 13-B does not permit the Court to dissolve a marriage by mutual consent not earlier than 6 months after the date of presentation of the petition or later than the expiry of 18 months after such presentation. The legislature, in its wisdom, has consciously provided the minimum and maximum waiting period during which alone a decree for divorce by mutual consent can be passed. The apparent object behind providing this period is to allow time to the spouses to reconsider their decision and finally make up their mind. It also enables the Court to satisfy itself that the 'consent' is free from any extraneous influence and is also not tainted with any 'collusion' between the parties.\t\t\t\t\t [Para 9,10,11]"

For instance, Rule 1 of Order III of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 ('Code' for short) states that a party may appear in Court either in person or by his recognized agent or by a pleader on his behalf. The proviso to the said rule, however, declares that any such appearance shall, if the Court so directs, be made by the party in person. Likewise, Rule 12 of Order IX provides that where a plaintiff or defendant, who was ordered to appear in person, does not appear in person, or show sufficient cause to the satisfaction of the Court for failing so to appear, he shall be subject to all the provisions of the said Order applicable to plaintiffs and defendants respectively who fails to appear. It is thus clear that in appropriate cases, a Civil Court may direct a party to the suit-plaintiff or defendant, to appear in person. \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 11]\n\nThe approach of a Court of law in matrimonial matters is much more constructive, affirmative and productive rather than abstract, theoretical or doctrinaire. Matrimonial matters must be considered by courts with human angle and sensitivity. Delicate issues affecting conjugal relations have to be handled carefully and legal provisions should be construed and interpreted without being oblivious or unmindful of human weaknesses. Probably, this aspect has been kept in view by the Legislature in enacting sub-section (2) of Section 23 of the Act by requiring a court to make all efforts to bring about reconciliation between the parties. \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 16]\n\nA Court is expected, nay, bound, to make all attempts and endeavours of reconciliation. To us, sub-section (2) of Section 23 is a salutary provision exhibiting the intention of Parliament requiring the Court 'in the first instance' to make every endeavour to bring about a reconciliation between the parties. If in the light of the above intention and paramount consideration of the Legislature in enacting such provision, an order is passed by a Matrimonial Court asking a party to the proceeding (husband or wife) to remain personally present, it cannot successfully be contended that the Court has no such power and in case a party to a proceeding does not remain present, at the most, the Court can proceed to decide the case ex parte against him/her. Upholding of such argument would virtually make the benevolent provision nugatory, ineffective and unworkable, defeating the laudable object of reconciliation in matrimonial disputes.  [Para 24]\n\nIn this case when the appeal was filed in the High Court by the aggrieved wife, the Court entertained it. Since the husband was not in India, notice was issued to him at his address as given in the Special Power of Attorney at Itali. The said order was passed on January 13, 2005. On July, 28, 2005, the Court noted that the notice had not come back served or unserved and hence, fresh notice was issued by making it returnable on November, 22, 2005. On the returnable date, i.e. November, 22, 2005, the wife was present in the Court. The Power of Attorney and brother of husband was also present in Court in person. The Court noted that the Power of Attorney contacted the respondent who is residing in Italy to find out the date on which he can remain present in the Court in person in the month of December, 2005. The Power of Attorney stated that he would be able to give a final date within one week. Accordingly, the case was differed for one week. On November, 29, 2005, the Power of Attorney made a statement before the Court that the husband \"shall positively be present in person on 2.2.2006\". The case was, therefore, adjourned to February, 2, 2006. On that day, however, the husband did not appear. Again, by an order dated April, 17, 2006, the parties were directed to be present in Court on May, 4, 2006. Since on that date also, the husband did not remain present whereas the wife attended the Court, the impugned order directing issuance of non-bailable warrant was passed.  The Court has jurisdiction to pass such order, it cannot be said that the direction issued by the High Court is without authority of law. \t\t\t\t\t      [Para 26,27]"

Right from ancient times, in Hindu society, marriage has been treated and dealt with as a sacrosanct relationship between the two human beings requiring performance of the respective rights and obligations between them.  Divorce in Hindu marriage was concept difficult of attainment and governed by stringent laws.  Any provision in Hindu Law did not by itself ipso facto or ipso jure, operated as a dissolution of the marriage nor did it give either party to the marriage an automatic right to divorce.  In other words, right to apply or obtain a divorce was ever controlled by the limitations of law and was not so liberally enforcible that a husband could marry and divorce a woman at his whim and fancy.  Even in modern times, the courts took the view that even if both the parties to a Hindu Marriage get converted to a religion other than Hindu, their earlier Hindu marriage can be dissolved only under the provision of that Act. (Vilayat Raj Vs. Sunita, AIR 1983 Del. 351). Prior to amendment of the Hindu Marriage Act in the year 1976, marriage of the parties could be dissolved only on the grounds stated under section 13 of the Act and the party claiming divorce had a heavy onus to discharge strictly in relation to the ground alleged for seeking such a relief.  However, after the amending Act 68 of 1976, not only various grounds stated in section 13 were liberalized to some extent but even section 13-B was inserted in the Hindu Marriage Act.  This, for the first time, provided the parties to the marriage solemnised before or after the commencement of the 1976 Amendment Act, to seek a relief for dissolution of their marriage by mutual consent.  Provision of sections 13(1) and 13(2) provide for a person seeking divorce on ground of mutual consent.  The provisions of section 13-B require that three ingredients had to be satisfied before the court to grant such a relief to the parties; (i) the parties had been living separately for a period of more than a year, (ii) they had not been able to live together and (iii) that they have mutually agreed to dissolve the marriage.  Once these three statutory conditions are satisfied then it gives jurisdiction to the court to entertain a petition for divorce by mutual consent.  Still the court, on motion of both the parties but not earlier than six months from the date of presentation of the petition and not later than 18 months after the said date, after recording the statement of the parties and giving them an opportunity of being heard and being satisfied that averments made in the petition are true, can pass a decree declaring the marriage to be dissolved with effect from the date of decree.  This procedure has been said to be mandatory and consent of the parties must exist at the time of presentation of the petition in accordance with the provisions of section 13-B(1) as well as at the time of making a motion and passing decree as per the provisions of section 13(2) of the Act.

Further, section 14 of the Act prior to 1976 amendment had put a further bar stating that notwithstanding anything contained in the Act, the courts shall not be competent to entertain any petition for dissolution of marriage by a decree of divorce unless the petition had been presented after a lapse of three years since the date of marriage.  However, proviso to section 14(1) provided an exception to the effect that a petition could be presented even before the expiry of the said period of three years if circumstances of exceptional hardship to the petitioner or of exceptional depravity on the part of the respondent existed and in such cases the courts may, after hearing, pronounce a decree subject to the condition that the decree shall not have effect until after the expiry of three years.  In this backdrop and while amending the Act in the year 1976, the Legislature while keeping the three of its aforementioned objects in mind, reduced the period from three years to one year and maintained the language of section 14 as well as its proviso otherwise intact.  In other words, the Legislature did not alter or change the contents of ingredients of section 14 except to the extent of reducing the period from three years to one year.  This is despite the fact that the Law Commission in its recommendations relating to section 14 of the Act in its 59th Report in March, 1974 had asked for deletion of section 14 of the Act.  By the same Act 68 of 1976, section 14 was amended and section 13-B was introduced in the Act.  The language of section 13-B is clear and unambiguous.  The Legislature in its wisdom did not introduce any relaxation in section 13-B of the Act.  There is nothing in the language of section which can suggest that the provisions of section 13-B are simplicitor procedurally directed and can be moulded by the court in exercise of its judicial discretion depending on the facts and circumstances of the case.  This provision is intended to liberalise the provisions relating to divorce.  Being aware of the existing provisions, report of the Law Commission and the need of the society still the Legislature chose not to add any proviso granting relaxation to the conditions imposed under section 13-B(1) and/or 13-B(2).  It would not be permissible for the court to read the expression 'living separately for a period of one year or more' as by adding the word 'may or for such period as the court in its discretion may consider appropriate'. We shall shortly proceed to discuss the purpose of introduction of section 13-B and its object.  It is a settled rule of interpretation that court while interpreting the statutory provisions would not add or subtract the words from the section nor would it give meaning to the language of the section other than what is intended on the plain reading of the provision.

The courts expressed the view that it was not merely a sacrament but also a civil contract.  This concept was examined in relation to determination of various cases for reliefs flowing from the marriage between the parties.  Introduction of the principle of a civil contract while it helped to support the conclusion reached in the particular case was, however, apt to give rise to a misconception and greater difficulties in other cases.  In Hindu Law, the admixture of religion and ethics with legal precepts was naturally congruent.  The ultimate view followed by the courts has been that it is not always to draw any hard line of logical demarcation between matters, secular and religious, because certain questions such as for instance as marriage and adoption had the aspects of both.  Marriage under Hindu Law was primarily and essentially a sacrament.  Having elements both, religion and secularity, it was the source and foundation of the status of the parties; and of their right to associate in religious observances and also of correlative rights and duties in temporal matters.  Under Hindu Marriage Act, the marriage must be solemnised in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of at least one of the parties thereto and must fulfil the conditions prescribed for the same.  The Act may not have used the expression 'sacramental marriage' but speaks of a 'Hindu marriage' solemnised in accordance with the customary rites and ceremonies of either party, presumably because of the very wide connotation of the expression 'Hindu' and the inappropriateness of emphasising the sacramental aspects when the customary rights and ceremonies are to be solemnised.  The element of consent is important as well.  Thus, Hindu marriage is essentially to be construed as a sacrament coupled with the rights and duties arising under the provisions of the Act.

The purpose of providing time is to give an opportunity to the parties to harmonise their lives rather than taking steps hastily to destroy the institution of marriage and convert Hindu marriage purely to a contractual relationship.  The basic human and social problem is of maladjustment of couples, as marriage could fail not because of wickedness of one party or the other but they just fail.  Many couples despite attempts of reconciliation over a reasonable time and despite of trying their best to make their marriages a success, may still fail and take recourse to dissolution of marriage.  But every trivial difference may not be a justifiable ground for invoking this provision without permitting the statutory period to lapse.  Educated and more civilised persons are expected to have greater respect for the institution of marriage and to their togetherness.  In their togetherness, they could always make space for each other's shadow.  This maladjustment should discernly be distinguished and understood in law from intransigent incompitability or irretrievable breakdown of marriage.  The principle of breakdown has found recognition in different forms.  Somewhere such breakdown may be left to be judged under the discretion of the court while in the other, the Legislature may provide the criterion and impose certain limitations.  Section 13-B of the Act is a combination to some extent of both these principles.  It is not necessary for any party to prove culpability or guilt or innocence or either of them but marriage is expected to be dissolved because it has broken down irretrievably and it should satisfy the limitation stated in the provisions.  It is evident that if divorce is made too easy or too difficult, both will result in frustrating the legislative object and the rule of reasonable interpretation is best applied to such provisions.  In matters of divorce, the court has to view not in terms of success or failure of a legal action alone but also examine a social therapeutic problem which needs a socially desirable, humane and just solution.

                "description": "Dissolution of marriage - Hindu marriage being a sacrament, in the matters of divorce, an approach of serious reconsideration over a reasonable time coupled with limitations of law is preferred rather than of instant actions and reactions resulting in declaring their marriage as failure - Held, it is socially and even legally obligatory for the parties to attempt serious reconciliation of a failing matrimonial relationship and even the Courts are duty bound to ensure that such an attempt is made.\n\nHindu marriage being a sacrament, in the matters of divorce, an approach of serious reconsideration over a reasonable time coupled with limitations of law is preferred rather than of instant actions and reactions resulting in declaring their marriage as failure.  Complete procedure is provided under section 13-B which is in consonance with law and constitutional mandate.  None of the provisions of Section 13-B affects mandate of equality before law or equal treatment in law.  Merely because the Legislature in its wisdom requires the parties to wait for a period of one year while living separately, it can neither be termed as unconstitutional or having no nexus with the object of the Act.  As already noticed, marriage is performed in accordance with the customary rites of the community, the family and friends are effectively involved in a marriage of the parties.  Once the marriage is solemnised, it is expected from the family and the friends that they would make all efforts to save the marriage between the parties and help them to overcome their differences and difficulties.  Undue anxiety to have recourse to legal proceedings attracts young generation as it appears to be an easy resolution of their problems.  This may appear to be so at the first blush but when examined in some depth with reflections on consequences and effects of such an approach, it turns out to be more disadvantageous than beneficial to the parties.  In the age of Information Technology with modernization in various facets of human life, tendency to take impulsive decisions is on the rise.  Tolerance in its basic application, as opposed to hurried, ill- considered decisions, is on the decline.  Today when the entire world has become a global family, there is tremendous scope for better mutual understanding and sensitive attitude towards human relationship even within family.  Ability to act faster in the modernised age necessarily must not result in instant decisions relating to delicate human relationship.  It is socially and even legally obligatory for the parties to attempt a serious reconciliation of a failing matrimonial relationship and even the courts are duty bound to ensure that such an attempt is made.  Like commercial commodities and/or services, marriage should not become a commodity as it will prove disastrous to the social fabric and the very institution of marriage under the Hindu Law.  Impulsive decisions to be recognized by law without even affording an opportunity to seriously ponder over the marital issues is not what the legislature had mandated in the language of section 13-B of the Act.  Instantaneous reaction to a situation may be arising out of the mistake or error on part of either of the spouse and, therefore, to dissolve the marriage between them without even letting a reasonable time to pass, would not be in conformity with the concept of the marriage being a sacrament backed by legal provisions.  Impulsiveness in human behaviour is a factor which even according to the Psychologist would adversely affect rational decisions in human relationship.   [Para 24.2]"

While interpreting the provision, they do hold the key in knowing the factors leading for change in law as well as object that is sought to be achieved by the legislature.  Reference can usefully be made to the object and reasons of an enactment while interpreting its provisions.  Freedom of the Court in interpreting a provision also has to be contained within permissible limits for even the Constitution does not give unlimited powers to anyone including the Judges as the law should not be subverted and the Rule of law must prevail.  Creativity would not extend in rendering the law ineffective or that the law is not the one enacted by the Legislature.  Equally true it is that few examples cannot be taken as a criteria for generalizing a problem of inconvenience.  The interpretation of law would depend upon rationalisation of the provision, keeping in view its general impact on society as a whole as the law has not been enacted for few people governed by the Hindu Law who may feel it to be socially inconvenient to them.  \t\t\t\t\t [Para 31,32]"

The word 'cruelty' has not been defined as perhaps it cannot be defined, for the reason that a particular situation to be termed as cruelty cannot be accepted to be present uniformally in each and every case. Different situations in relation to different classes of people having regard to their status, education, culture and way of life may have to be appreciated to determine whether the same amounts to cruelty. When a particular behaviour in one case can be said to be cruelty, it may not be so in another case. Therefore, no strait-jacket formula can be devised for uniform application for the purpose of determining whether a particular situation amounts to cruelty.   [Para 6]"

                "description": "Cruelty - Burden of proof - Standard of proof required - Proof beyond reasonable doubt cannot be imported in trials of a purely civil nature - Test to apply is whether on preponderance of probabilities relevant fact is proved.\n\nThe normal rule which governs civil proceedings is that a fact can be said to be established if it is proved by a preponderance of probabilities. This is for the reason that under the Evidence Act, Sec. 3, a fact is said to be proved when the court either believes it to exist or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists. The belief regarding the existence of a fact may thus be founded on a balance of probabilities. A prudent man faced with conflicting probabilities concerning a fact situation will act on the supposition that the fact exists, if on weighing the various probabilities he finds that the preponderance is in favour of the existence of the particular fact. As a prudent man, so the court applies this test for finding whether a fact in issue can be said to be proved. The first step in this of process is to fix the probabilities, the second to weigh them, though the two may often intermingle. The impossible is weeded out at the first stage, the improbable at the second. Within the wide range of probabilities the court has often a difficult choice to make but it is this choice which ultimately determines where the preponderance of probabilities lies. [Para 24]\n\nProof beyond reasonable doubt is proof by a higher standard which generally governs criminal trials or trials involving inquiry into issues of a quasi-criminal nature. A criminal trial involves the liberty of the subject which may not be taken away on a mere preponderance of probabilities. If the probabilities are so nicely balanced that a reasonable, not a vacillating, mind cannot find where the preponderance lies, a doubt arises regarding the existence of the fact to be proved and the benefit of such reasonable doubt goes to the accused. It is wrong to import such considerations in trials of a purely civil nature.  [Para 25]\n\nNeither Section 10 of the Act which enumerates the grounds on which a petition for judicial separation may be presented nor Section 23 which governs the jurisdiction of the court to pass a decree in any proceeding under the Act requires that the petitioner must prove his case beyond a reasonable doubt. Section 23 confers on the court the power to pass a decree if it is \"satisfied\" on matters mentioned in Cls.(a) to (e) of the section. Considering that proceedings under the Act are essentially of a civil nature, the word \"satisfied\" must mean \"satisfied on a preponderance of probabilities\" and not \"satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt\". Section 23 does not alter the standard of proof in civil cases.  [Para 26]"

It is not necessary, as under the English law, that the cruelty must be of such a character as to cause \"danger\" to life, limb or health or as to give rise to a reasonable apprehension of such a danger. Clearly, danger to life, limb or health or a reasonable apprehension of it is a higher requirement than a reasonable apprehension that it is harmful or injurious for one spouse to live with the other. If the danger to health arises merely from the fact that the spouses find it impossible to live together as where one of the parties shows an attitude of indifference to the other, the charge of cruelty may perhaps fail. But under Section 10(1)(b), harm or injury to health reputation, the working-career or the like would be an important consideration in determining whether the conduct of the respondent amounts to cruelty. Plainly, what we must determine is not whether the petitioner has proved the charge of cruelty having regard to the principles of English law, but whether the petitioner proves that the respondent has treated him with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable apprehension in his mind that it will be harmful or injurious for him to live with the respondent.

It is obscured but not obliterated\". See Words and Phrases Legally Defined (Butterworths), 1969 Ed Vol.I, p.305 (\"Condonation\").

Her conduct clearly exposits that it has resulted in causing agony and anguish in the mind of the husband. She had publicised in the newspapers that he was a womaniser and a drunkard. She had made wild allegations about his character. She had made an effort to prosecute him in criminal litigations which she had failed to prove. The feeling of deep anguish, disappointment, agony and frustration of the husband is obvious. It can be stated with certitude that the cumulative effect of the evidence brought on record clearly establish a sustained attitude of causing humiliation and calculated torture on the part of the wife to make the life of the husband miserable. The husband felt humiliated both in private and public life. Indubitably, it created a dent in his reputation which is not only the salt of life, but also the purest treasure and the most precious perfume of life. Thus, analysed, it is abundantly clear that with this mental pain, agony and suffering, the husband cannot be asked to put up with the conduct of the wife and to continue to live with her. Therefore, he is entitled to a decree for divorce.  [Para 38,40]"

The right of appeal is a substantive right granted to the losing spouse by Section 28 of the 1955 Act, which is presumed to be known to the holder of a decree of divorce. If any element of that right is defeated by the acts of holder of a decree of divorce then it would constitute wilful disobedience of 'other process of the Court'. The fact of entering into second marriage by the holder of a decree of divorce beyond the period of limitation would not constitute a basis for him or her to argue that provisions of Section 15 of the 1955 Act, alone may be attracted because Section 15 of the 1955 Act does not take into account wilful disobedience of the other process of the Court, which include the right of filing an appeal. Once the right of filing appeal is conceded as a substantive right then re-conciliation proceedings have to be construed as part of the right of appeal. The excuse of entering into second marriage after the period of limitation cannot be put forward as a valid excuse for testing the conduct of a spouse in the light of the disobedience of other process of the Court. Suppose, an appeal has been filed within the period of limitation and it is heard by the Court a week after the expiry of the period of limitation, the Court after hearing the appeal also issues an interim order restraining the holder of a decree of divorce to remarry, the process of the Court is likely to take some time. Is it possible for the holder of a decree of divorce to argue that since he/she has married after the expiry of the period of limitation as provided under Section 28 of the 1955 Act, he/she should not be held guilty of violating the other process of the Court. The answer is obvious that such an argument cannot be raised. Such an approach would be consistent with the policy of law as reflected in Section 23(2) and (3) of the 1955 Act. If the law be otherwise then a game of hide and seek would follow, which may result in defeating basic principles of law aimed at re-conciliation.   [Para 16]"

Firstly, the Courts can always declare the other marriage as unlawful under Section 15 of the 1955 Act thereby proceed in accordance with law for bigamy. Moreover, the element of mens rea, which is required to be proved in criminal contempt, has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt without leaving it to any inference. The classical case of obstruction in the administration of justice is to scandalize the Court in the face of the Court or kidnapping a witness preventing him from appearing in a trial.

It may be mental or physical, intentional or unintentional. It is a question of fact and degree. If it is physical, the Court will have no problem in determining the same. However, if it is mental cruelty, the enquiry must begin with the nature of cruel treatment and the impact of such treatment in the mind of the spouse, whether it caused reasonable apprehension that it would be harmful or injurious to live with the other. Of course ultimately, it is a matter of inference to be drawn by taking into account the nature of conduct and its effect on the complaining spouse. The conduct complained of must be \"grave and weighty\" so as to come to a conclusion that the spouse cannot be reasonably expected to live with the other spouse. It must be more serious than \"ordinary wear and tear of married life.\" Mental cruelty must consist of verbal abuses and insults by using filthy and abusive language leading to constant disturbances of mental peace of the other party.

A law which has extra-territorial operation cannot directly be enforced in another State but such a law is not invalid and saved by Article 245 (2) of the Constitution of India. Article 245(2) provides that no law made by Parliament shall be deemed to be invalid on the ground that it would have extra-territorial operation.

The Court is bound to pass a decree of divorce declaring the marriage of the parties before it to be dissolved with effect from the date of the decree, if the following conditions are met:\n\na.\tA second motion of both the parties is made not before 6 months from the date of filing of the petition as required under sub-section (1) and not later than 18 months;\n\nb.\tAfter hearing the parties and making such inquiry as it thinks fit, the Court is satisfied that the averments in the petition are true; and\n\nc.\tThe petition is not withdrawn by either party at any time before passing the decree;\n\nIn other words, if the second motion is not made within the period of 18 months, then the Court is not bound to pass a decree of divorce by mutual consent. Besides, from the language of the Section, as well as the settled law, it is clear that one of the parties may withdraw their consent at any time before the passing of the decree. The most important requirement for a grant of a divorce by mutual consent is free consent of both the parties. In other words, unless there is a complete agreement between husband and wife for the dissolution of the marriage and unless the Court is completely satisfied, it cannot grant a decree for divorce by mutual consent. Otherwise, the expression 'divorce by mutual consent' would be otiose. In the present fact scenario, the second motion was never made by both the parties as is a mandatory requirement of the law, and no Court can pass a decree of divorce in the absence of that. The non-withdrawal of consent before the expiry of the said eighteen months has no bearing. The eighteen month period was specified only to ensure quick disposal of cases of divorce by mutual consent, and not to specify the time period for withdrawal of consent.   [Para 14,16]"

It must be seen if there is evidence of some course of conduct sufficiently grave, beyond the vicissitudes of daily life, as would make it impossible reasonably to expect the complaining spouse to live with the other. There is no longer any legal requirement of proof of apprehension of harm, injury or physical violence. Much of the evidentiary material is, of necessity, inferential. One party's inability to fully compromise and adjust may not, per se, constitute cruelty. It is true that cruelty sometimes walks in silence. It may, in a given case, be no more than a persistent attitude wholly inimical to the relationship.\n\nIn the instant case, a little short of three years after their marriage, S and Y had a son. The trajectory of this marriage does not, therefore, indicate that S's wanting a separate residence was seen by either Y or his parents as fatal to the marriage. Demanding privacy and there is evidence that this was admittedly lacking in the confined spaces of the matrimonial home and a separate residence is not, per se, an act of cruelty, even mental cruelty or emotional trauma. How the parties responded to this must be gauged. In the instant case, contention that on the pleadings and evidence and looking to the conduct of the parties, it is not possible to hold in favour of the husband on ground of cruelty on this ground, is correct.\n\n2010(3) ALL MR 977, 2010(2) ALL MR 925 (S.C.), 2005(5) ALL MR 313 (S.C.)

                "description": "Matrimonial offence/fault theory - Party suffering \"guilt\" or \"fault\" disentitles himself/herself from consideration.\n\nA perusal of the grounds on which divorce can be sought under Section 13(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, would reveal, that the same are grounds based on the 'fault' of the party against whom dissolution of marriage is sought. In matrimonial jurisprudence, such provisions are founded on the 'matrimonial offence theory' or the 'fault theory'. Under this jurisprudential principle, it is only on the ground of an opponent's fault, that a party may approach a Court for seeking annulment of his/her matrimonial alliance. In other words, if either of the parties is guilty of committing a matrimonial offence, the aggrieved party alone is entitled to divorce. The party seeking divorce under the \"matrimonial offence theory\" / the \"fault theory\" must be innocent. A party suffering \"guilt\" or \"fault\" disentitles himself/herself from consideration. Illustratively, desertion for a specified continuous period, is one of the grounds for annulment of marriage. But the aforesaid ground for annulment is available only, if the desertion is on account of the fault of the opposite party, and not fault of the party which has approached the Court. Therefore, if a husband's act of cruelty, compels a wife to leave her matrimonial home, whereupon, she remains away from the husband for the stipulated duration, it would not be open to a husband to seek dissolution of marriage, on the ground of desertion. The reason being, that it is the husband himself who was at fault, and not the wife. This is exactly what the respondent has contended. Her claim is, that in actuality the appellant is making out a claim for a decree of divorce, on the basis of allegations for which he himself is singularly responsible. On the said allegations, it is the husband, who deserves to be castigated. Therefore, he cannot be allowed to raise an accusing finger at the respondent on the basis of the said allegations, or to seek dissolution of marriage, thereon.\n\nThere is no dispute between the rival parties, that after wife's first conception was aborted in June, 1999, the attending gynecologist had cautioned the couple against any further conception for at least two years. The couple had been advised, that pregnancy during this period could lead to serious medical complications. Wife alleges, that her husband had proceeded with unsafe cohabitation, leading to her second pregnancy, within a short period of eight months (after the abortion in June, 1999), i.e. well within the risk period. Clearly contrary to the medical advisory. The truth of the second conception, cannot be disputed, in view of the overwhelming supporting evidence on the record of the case. The conception could have only occurred because of, unprotected sexual indulgence by husband. The medical condition of wife, was for one and only one reason, namely, the second conception, during the unsafe period. Clearly, the blame thereof, rests squarely on the shoulders of appellant. It is in this view of the matter, that the submissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for appellant, have been vehemently opposed. The grounds/facts on which divorce is sought by the appellant, are not at all available to him under the \"fault theory\" on which Section 13(1) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, is founded.\t         [Para 35,36]"

                "description": "Irretrievable breakdown of marriage and doing complete justice between the parties - Wife not consenting to severance of ties though she had suffered for no fault on her part - Court cannot grant divorce under S.13 or by invoking Art.142.\n\nIn this case court cannot grant a decree of divorce on the ground of irretrievable breakdown of marriage, for the simple reason that the breakdown is only from the side of the husband. The wife has consistently maintained, that she was intensely concerned with her future relationship with her husband, and that, her greatest and paramount desire was to rejoin her husband, and to live with him normally in a matrimonial relationship, once again. Since in the present case, the respondent wife does not consent to the severance of matrimonial ties, it is not possible to accede to the instant prayer, made by the appellant. Doing justice between the parties is clearly a constitutional obligation. This Court has been bestowed with the discretion \". to make such order as is necessary for doing complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it.\". The concept of justice, however, varies depending on the interest of the party. On most occasions, it is advisable to adjudicate matters in consonance with law. Whenever it is possible to do so, on the touchstone of the courts conscience, the determination rendered would simultaneously result in doing justice between the parties. The matter will be examined as if, the wife had approached the Family Court seeking divorce, on the ground that her husband had suffered brain damage leading to cognitive deficiencies. Yet, despite the said deficiencies, his working memory had returned to \"near normal\" after treatment. And his mental condition was such, that it would not have any effect on his matrimonial obligations. And the wife's family is agreeable to pay an amount to be determined by this Court (just as the husband, has offered), so as to enable their daughter to break away, and find a more suitable match. Should she have been granted freedom from her matrimonial ties, in the given facts, in order to do complete justice to the parties? We would ask ourselves, whether the husband would have accepted such a plea, in the facts denoted above? In such situation, if this Court had, in exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 142 of the Constitution granted compensation to the husband, and had dissolved his marriage on the pretext of doing complete justice between the parties, would the same be acceptable to the husband? We have no doubt that on a reversal of roles, the husband, without any fault of his own, would have never accepted as just, the dissolution of his matrimonial ties, even if the couple had been separated for a duration, as is the case in hand. Specially, if the husband had, right from the beginning, fervently expressed the desire to restore his matrimonial relationship with his wife, and to live a normal life with her. If the same sequence of facts cannot be viewed as doing justice to the husband, they have to be likewise viewed for the wife as well. \t\t\t\t           [Para 39,40,41,42]"

The question, however, is whether for constituting condonation, the conduct of only one of the parties is to be considered or whether the conduct of both parties is to be taken into account. In other words, whether the unilateral act of one of the parties is to be considered or whether the bilateral acts of both parties are to be considered. If for constituting condonation, there must be forgiveness and restoration, it is obvious that bilateral acts of both parties will be required to be taken into account while considering the aspect of condonation. Forgiveness and restoration cannot be unilateral and for it to be effective and fruitful, it has to be bilateral. One party to the marital tie may be ready to forgive and restore the same. One of the modes could be by filing proceedings for restitution of conjugal rights. The other party may, however, not be ready to forgive and restore said tie. The proceedings filed by one party for restitution could be opposed by the other by refusing to rejoin the marital tie. The same would not result in condonation in as much as there would be no consensus between the parties for the purposes of forgiveness and restoration. It would remain onesided. Hence, the aspect of condonation will have to be adjudicated after taking into account the bilateral acts of both parties. The offer made by one party and the reciprocal conduct of the other will have to be viewed together while determining codonation in terms of Section 23(1)(b) of the said Act.\n\nIn matter like one at hand, where the desertion continues without even a day's break, the conditional forgiveness offered by the husband is not reciprocated by the respondent wife. On the contrary, she refuses to take advantage of the opportunity available and persists in desertion. As such, condonation which technically is a bilateral act or decision, never occurred and therefore the wife cannot resist the decree of divorce on the ground that husband has condoned her acts.\n\nAIR 2006 HP 33, AIR 1993 HP 1, AIR 2012 Raj 8 Dissented from.

The respondent could not prove her case before the Criminal Court though the prosecution had examined six witnesses, including the respondent herein and the appellant and his family members were arrested and were subsequently released.

To constitute condonation there must be, therefore, two things: forgiveness and restoration. The evidence of condonation in the instant case is, as strong and satisfactory as the evidence of cruelty. But that evidence does not consist in the mere fact that the spouses continued to share a common home during or for some time after the spell of cruelty. Cruelty, generally, does not consist of a single, isolated act but consists in most cases of a series of acts spread over a period of time. Law does not require that at the first appearance of a cruel act, the other spouse must leave the matrimonial home lest the continued cohabitation be construed as condonation. Such a construction will hinder reconciliation and thereby frustrate the benign purpose of marriage laws.\n2007 ALL SCR (O.C.C.) 65 Ref. to.   [Para 55]"

It loosely describes a class of diseases that are transmitted not \"exclusively\" by sexual contact but \"chiefly\" by sexual contact. Some decades back the existence of HIV virus, it's means of transmission, it's infection and consequences thereof were unknown. Had the term been defined by specifying the diseases falling therein, it would have been impossible to consider the infection by HIV virus as a venereal disease. That being not the position, Court will have to look for the common factors between the diseases that are accepted to be venereal diseases and the infection of HIV virus. The main common factor is the means of transmission. Like other venereal diseases of syphilis, gonorrhea, Hepatitis B etc., the infection of HIV virus is chiefly transmitted sexually. The other means of transmission are less common. Merely because there are other means of transmission, it is not possible to restrict the meaning of \"venereal disease\" and omit infection of HIV virus therefrom.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 12]\n\nInfection of HIV virus leading to AIDS is covered by ground of divorce at Section 13(1)(v) of the Act.

Under Clause (ia) of Sub-section (1) of Section 13 and under sub-section (1) of Section 10 of the Act, cruelty is a ground of divorce as well as judicial separation respectively. Whether a particular act or conduct complained of, is covered under the ground of cruelty or not, is to be decided on the facts and circumstances of each of the case. The question as to whether a particular act or behaviour would amount to cruelty or not depends upon the character, way of life of the parties, their social and economic conditions, their status, customs and traditions. Each case is to be decided on the facts of its own. Cruelty is classified into two heads i.e. physical cruelty and mental cruelty. Unending accusations and imputations can cause more pain and misery than a physical beating. Mental cruelty can be inflicted in various ways. In the instant case, the trial Judge after considering the evidence on record has passed decree of divorce and, in our view, it cannot be said that no case of cruelty has been made by the respondent wife. The respondent wife has already narrated the incident in her affidavit which she had tendered in lieu of examination-in-chief and nothing substantial has been brought on record on behalf of the appellant in the cross-examination of the respondent-wife. Considering the same, it cannot be said that the allegations made by the respondent against the appellant are false. Considering the evidence on record the decree passed by the trial Court regarding dissolution of marriage, therefore, is required to be upheld.  [Para 17]"

But in a case where there is a violation of such a condition, the question arises whether it can be construed as a void marriage or a voidable marriage at the instance of one of the parties under Section 11 and 12 respectively of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. On a careful reading of Section 11 and 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, it is found that the Legislature has purposely omitted to include the requirement of Section 5 (iii) to attract the provisions under Section 11 and 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. In other words, even if the marriage has been solemnized between a bride who is less than 18 years and a bridegroom aged less than 21 years, it cannot be held to be void under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. Referring to the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 to analyze the ultimate consequences of a child marriage. 'Child' as per the definition found under Section 2(a) means 'a person who, if a male, has not completed 21 years of age and, if a female, has not completed 18 years of age'. Of course, such a child marriage as per Section 3 of the Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006 is voidable at the option of one of the contracting parties, being a child at the time of marriage. It is very important to refer to Section 3(b) of the said Act which would read that the petition under Section 3 of the said Act can be filed beforever the child filing the petition completes 2 years of attaining majority. Therefore, at the distance of time, the appellant cannot contend that the marriage performed when he was below 21 years of age is void and, therefore, he cannot be directed to take his wife to the matrimonial home.

There may be instances of cruelty by the unintentional but inexcusable conduct of any party. The cruel treatment may also result by the cultural conflict of the spouses.

That word has to be understood in the ordinary sense of the term in matrimonial affairs. If the intention to harm, harass or hurt could be inferred by the nature of the conduct or brutal act complained of, cruelty could be easily established.

Under Section 28(4) of the Hindu Marriage Act the period of limitation is prescribed for orders passed under the Hindu Marriage Act. In this view of the matter, the stipulation of Section 19(3) are more general in nature inasmuch as they cover not only orders passed by the Family Court under the Hindu Marriage Act but cover all appealable orders passed in proceedings before the Family Court. The stipulations of Section 19(3) of the Family Courts Act being general in nature and Section 28(4) of the Hindu Marriage Act as amended being special in nature (in that they refer to one class of cases which fall under Section 19 of the Family Courts Act.) Stipulation of Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act in which the relevant sub-section (4) appears must be reckoned to be special more appropriate and specific, inasmuch as the said provision confers substantive right of appeal. Section 19(3) assumes a more general character. A substantive provision must get precedence over a procedural provision. The Hindu Marriage Act is the piece of substantive law which confers the power to pass the order in question and the right to prefer appeals. The Family Courts Act does not deal with substantive rights of the parties but only deals with the manner in which the matters coming within Section 7 of the Family Courts Act have to be dealt with and disposed of by the Family Courts. To this extent, it has to be held that the stipulations in the Hindu Marriage Act deal with substantive right of the parties and the substantive right of appeal whereas the stipulations in the Family Courts Act deal with procedural matters. On the principle that prominence and predominance must be given to the statutes dealing with substantive rights in preference to those dealing with procedural stipulations, the stipulation of the period of limitation in Section 28(4), must be preferred.

It is so because of the specific circumstances that the Court would require to see at the time of each of these applications. It may be clarified that for considering the application for interim maintenance under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, which is decided upon affidavits of the parties alone, the Court cannot and would not consider the precise income, standard of living, conduct of the parties, other properties and other circumstances of the case. The amount that would have to be granted for the maintenance of the wife would be for her support and necessary expenses of the proceedings. That amount would be granted if she does not have income sufficient for her support and necessary expenses of the proceedings. The ambit for grant of interim maintenance under Section 24 is, therefore, far narrower than the ambit under Section 25. It is the distinction between the two sections which is required to be understood for the Court to grant the maintenance amounts thereunder. Under Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act as aforesaid, the entire evidence relating to the income, properties of both the parties and their conduct and circumstances would be and can be seen.

Religion is a belief which binds the spiritual nature of man to a supernatural being; it is an object of conscientious devotion, faith and pietism. Devotion in its fullest sense is a consecration and denotes an act of worship. Faith in the strict sense constitutes firm reliance on the truth of religious doctrines in every system of religion. Religion, faith or devotion are not easily interchangeable. If the person feigns to have adopted another religion just for some wordly gain or benefit, it would be religious bigotry. Looked at from this angle, a person who mockingly adopts another religion where plurality of marriage is permitted so as to renounce the previous marriage and desert the wife, he cannot be permitted to take advantage of his exploitation as religion is not a commodity to be exploited. The institution of marriage under every personal law is a sacred institution. Under Hindu Law, Marriage is a sacrament. Both have to be preserved.  [Para 38]"

It must be something more than that. The behavior and conduct of the spouse is guided by their social status, educational qualifications, physical and mental condition and the cultural and social background. The behavior of a spouse might cause anguish, disappointment, frustration or agitation to the wronged spouse, but that by itself, is not sufficient. The party who approaches the court is expected to furnish the particular facts which according to him/her are of such a nature that would have caused mental cruelty of such an intensity that it is impossible for him/her to continue to live with the other spouse. It is legal cruelty which is required to be proved in order to succeed. The behavior and conduct of response should be so acute and of such a grave nature and magnitude that would make it difficult for the wronged spouse to continue in the relationship. The court should be able to deduce therefrom that it is not in his/her welfare to continue with such a relationship. The wronged spouse needs to prove all these facts which creates such a apprehension in his/her mind.

Cruelty has not been defined under the Act but In relation to matrimonial matters it is contemplated as a conduct of such type which endangers the living of the petitioner with the respondent. Cruelty consists of acts which are dangerous to life, limb or health. Cruelty for the purpose of the Act means where one spouse has so treated the other and manifested such feelings towards her or him as to have inflicted bodily injury, or to have caused reasonable apprehension of bodily injury, suffering or to have injured health. Cruelty may be physical or mental. Mental cruelty is the conduct of other spouse which causes mental suffering or fear to the matrimonial life of the other. \"Cruelty\", therefore, postulates a treatment of the petitioner with such cruelty as to cause a reasonable apprehension in his or her mind that it would be harmful or injurious for the petitioner to live with the other party. Cruelty, however, has to be distinguished from the ordinary wear and tear of family life. It cannot be decided on the basis of the sensitivity of the petitioner and has to be adjudged on the basis of the course of conduct which would, in general, be dangerous for a spouse to live with the other. In the instant case both the trial Court as well as the High Court have found on facts that the wife had failed to prove the allegations of cruelty attributed to the respondent. Concurrent findings of fact arrived at by the Courts cannot be disturbed by this Court in exercise of powers under Article 136 of the Constitution of India. Otherwise also the averments made in the petition and the evidence led in support thereof clearly shows that the allegations, even if held to have been proved, would only show the sensitivity of the appellant with respect to the conduct of the respondent which cannot be termed more than ordinary wear and tear of the family life.

                ],
                "description": "Desertion - There can be no desertion without previous cohabitation by parties - Wife cannot be permitted to take advantage of her own wrong after marriage.\n\n\"Desertion\",, for the purpose of seeking divorce under the Act, means the intentional permanent forsaking and abandonment of one spouse by the other without that other's consent and without reasonable cause. In other words it is a total repudiation of the obligations of marriage. Desertion is not the withdrawal from a place but from a state of things. Desertion, therefore, means withdrawing from the matrimonial obligations, i.e. not permitting or allowing and facilitating the cohabitation between the parties. The proof of desertion has to be considered by taking into consideration the concept of marriage which in law legalizes the sexual relationship between man and woman in the society for the perpetuation of race, permitting lawful indulgence in passion to prevent licentiousness and for procreation of children. Desertion is not a single act complete in itself, it is a continuous course of conduct to be determined under the facts and circumstances of each case.  If a spouse abandons the other in a state of temporary passions, for example, anger or disgust without intending permanently to cease cohabitation, it will not amount to desertion.    [Para 7A]\n\nFor the offence of desertion so far as deserting spouse is concerned, two essential conditions must be there (1) the factum of separation and (2) the intention to bring cohabitation permanently to an end (animus deserendi). Similarly two elements are essential so far as the deserted spouse is concerned : (1) the absence of consent, and (2) absence of conduct giving reasonable cause to the spouse leaving the matrimonial home to form the necessary intention aforesaid. For holding desertion proved the inference may be drawn from certain facts which may not in another case be capable of leading to the same inference: that is to say the facts have to be viewed as to the purpose which is revealed by those acts or by conduct and expression of intention, both anterior and subsequent to the actual acts of separation. \t [Para 8]\n\nTo prove desertion in matrimonial matter it is not always necessary that one of the spouse should have left the company of the other as desertion could be proved while living under the same roof.  Desertion cannot be equated with separate living by the parties to the marriage.  Desertion may also be constructive which can be inferred from the attending circumstances.  It has always to be kept in mind that the question of desertion is a matter of inference to be drawn from the facts and circumstances of each case.     [Para 9]\n\nAs desertion in matrimonial cases means the withdrawal of one party from a state of things, i.e., a marital status of the party, no party to the marriage can be permitted to allege desertion unless he or she admits that after the formal ceremonies of the marriage, the parties had recognized and discharged the common obligation of the married life which essentially requires the cohabitation between the parties for the purpose of consummating the marriage. Cohabitation by the parties is an essential of a valid marriage as the object of the marriage is to further the perpetuation of the race by permitting lawful indulgence in passions for procreation of children. In other words, there can be no desertion without previous cohabitation by the parties. The basis for this theory is built upon the recognized position of law in, matrimonial matters that no-one can desert who does not actively or willfully bring to an end the existing state of cohabitation. However, such a rule is subject to just exceptions which may be found in a case on the ground of mental or physical incapacity or other peculiar circumstances of the case. However, the party seeking divorce on the ground of desertion is required to show that she was not taking the advantage of his or her own. [Para 10]\n\nIn the instant case the appellant herself pleaded that there had not been cohabitation between the parties after the marriage. She neither assigned any reason nor attributed the non-resumption of cohabitation to the respondent. From the pleadings and evidence led in the case, it is apparent that the appellant did not permit the respondent to have cohabitation for consummating the marriage. In the absence of cohabitation between the parties, a particular state of matrimonial position was never permitted by the appellant to come into existence. In the present case, in the absence of cohabitation and consummation of marriage, the appellant was disentitled to claim divorce on the ground of desertion. [Para 11]"

In a vast country like ours, the powers under the Act are generally exercisable by the District Court and the first appeal has to be filed in the High Court. The distance, the geographical conditions, the financial position of the parties and the time required for filing a regular appeal, if kept in mind, would certainly show that the period of 30 days prescribed for filing the appeal is insufficient and inadequate. In the absence of appeal, the other party can solemnise the marriage and attempt to frustrate the appeal right of the other side as appears to have been done in the instant case. A minimum period of 90 days may be prescribed for filing the appeal against any judgment and decree under the Act and any marriage solemnized during the aforesaid period be deemed to be void. Appropriate legislation is required to be made in this regard. We direct the Registry that the copy of this judgment may be forwarded to the Ministry of Law & Justice for such action as it may deem fit to take in this behalf. [Para 18]"

(a) incurable unsound mind; and, (b) respondent spouse has been suffering continuously or intermittently from mental disorder and the disorder is of such kind and of such extent that the petitioner cannot reasonably be expected to live with the respondent.\n\n\tFrom the wording of the aforesaid provision it can be said that the mental condition like incurable unsound mind mentioned in the first part or the mental disorder mentioned in the second part needs to be proved by expert evidence and that evidence needs to satisfy the Court that such mental condition exists. From the wording of the provision it can be said that the second part of the provision has wide scope. For this part, it is not necessary that mental disorder is incurable. However, the mental disorder must be of such kind and extent that the Court needs to be satisfied that it is not advisable to ask the petitioner to live with the respondent. The scope shows that there is no limit to the kind of mental disorder as no specific kind is mentioned. However, the term \"has been suffering\" shows that the period of illness must not be too short or the petition should not be based on one or two instances showing such mental disorder. The term \"intermittently\" cannot be misread in this provision to infer that the mental illness returns after the treatment within few days. The term \"extent\" is also important and on that also the Court needs to be satisfied to come to the conclusion that the petitioner cannot be reasonably expected to live with the husband. Thus the relief is discretionary and while using discretion, the Court is expected to keep in mind the aforesaid things. \t\t\t [Para 10,11]"

The object of legislation was mainly (i) to liberalise the provisions relating to divorce. The amendment which introduced clause (iii) in the year 1976 was intended to remove certain anomalies and handicaps that had come to light after the passing of the Act of 1955. \t\t [Para 31]\n\n\tIn section 13 of the Act, the meaning of expression 'mental disorder' is given and meaning of expression 'psychopathic disorder' is also given. However, the meaning of 'unsound mind' is not given in this section. The meaning of 'unsound mind' or the definition of this term is available in other Acts like Indian Penal Code or Contract Act. But, the purpose behind inclusion of that term in the relevant provisions of that Act needs to be kept in mind. The same meaning cannot be attached to the term 'unsound mind' as used in clause (iii) of section 13 (1) of the Act as the term is not separately used, but it is affixed by the word 'incurably'. Thus, the mental illness mentioned in first part of section 13 (1) (iii) is incurably unsound mind. In view of the absence of meaning of this term in the Act itself, it needs to be presumed that the word needs to be understood in it's natural, ordinary or popular sense. In the law.com dictionary, the meaning of 'unsound mind' is given as '\"a person of unsound mind is an adult who from infirmity of mind is incapable of managing himself or his affairs. The term, therefore, includes insane persons, idiots and imbeciles\". This definition is also found in black;s law dictionary, 2nd Edition. This Court holds that the meaning given above to 'unsound mind' needs to be used in the present matter. If the word 'incurable' is prefixed to this term, one can find that this kind of illness is different from the mental illness mentioned after word 'or' in clause (iii) of section 13 (1). The explanation given to the clause shows that such mental illness mentioned after word 'or' includes schizophrenia. Though schizophrenia also can be called as incurable mental illness, that illness may not be of kind mentioned above viz. the patient is incapable of managing himself or his affairs. So, this Court has no hesitation to hold that the mental illness mentioned on two sides of word 'or' in aforesaid provision are of different kinds.\n\n2010(5) ALL MR 934 (S.C.)

Court has already quoted the evidence of the husband and the evidence given by doctor, who is giving treatment to the wife. The illness is described as schizophrenia and the evidence shows that the illness can be kept under control by medicines. However, the evidence like description of the symptoms given in discharge card shows that during attack, wife shows irritability, disruptive behaviour and also hostility. The husband has given evidence that in the month of June 2001 itself, he first noticed the illness of the wife. His evidence shows that even after that he continued cohabitation. Some record of giving treatment in Amravati is also produced though doctor from Amravati is not examined by the husband. The wife had admitted that circumstance. One incident of November 2004 is admitted by both the sides and the evidence of the doctor shows that few days prior to that incident, wife had come to him as patient for receiving treatment for the same illness. Though the defence is taken that her father had taken her to Aurangabad due to situation created by husband, the fact remains that father of the wife had informed to police that on his own he was taking the wife to Aurangabad due to her mental condition. After that the wife continued to receive treatment of doctor due to her mental illness. The evidence of husband shows that even after learning about mental illness, he continued cohabitation with the wife and he got female issue from her. He approached police first time in November 2014 and informed to police that due to illness of the wife and due to the incidents which are mentioned in the petition also like her suicidal tendency and tendency to cause harm even to daughter she was taken back to the parents house by her parents. He had expressed apprehension that there was possibility of his false implication from the side of his wife. Since then the parties are living separate. If the evidence of husband and the medical evidence is read together, it can be said that the probability as required by second part of section 13 (1) (iii) is created by the husband. The matter needs to be decided on preponderance of probability. Due to independent evidence of doctor, who has given treatment to the wife in Aurangabad, there is no reason to disbelieve the husband on his case that he cannot reasonably be expected to live with the wife. However, the evidence is not sufficient to make out the case of illness of first part of this clause. \t\t\t\t [Para 35]"

A party to a civil litigation, it is axiomatic, is not entitled to constitutional protections under Art.20 of the Constitution of India. Thus, the Civil Court although may not have any specific provisions in the Code of Civil Procedure and the Evidence Act, has an inherent power in terms of Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure to pass all orders for doing complete justice to the parties to the suit.  Discretionary power under Section 151 of Code of Civil Procedure,it is trite, can be exercised also on an application filed by the party.\t [Para 32,33]\n\nIn certain cases medical examination by the experts in the field may not only found to be leading to truth of the matter but may also lead to removal of misunderstanding between the parties. It may bring the parties to terms. Having regard to development in medicinal technology, it is possible to find out that what was presumed to be a mental disorder of a spouse is not really so.  In matrimonial disputes, the Court has also a conciliatory role to play-even for the said purpose it may require expert advice.\t [Para 34,35,36]\n\nThe prime concern of the Court is to find out as to whether a person who is said to be mentally ill could defend himself properly or not. Determination of such an issue although may have some relevance with the determination of the issue in the lis, nonetheless, the Court cannot be said to be wholly powerless in this behalf. Furthermore, it is one thing to say that a person would be subjected to test which would invade his right of privacy and may in some case amount to battery; but it is another thing to say that a party may be asked to submit himself to a psychiatrist or a psychoanalyst so as to enable the Court to arrive at a just conclusion. Whether the party to the marriage requires a treatment or not  can be found out only in the event, he is examined by a properly qualified  Psychiatrist. For the said purpose, it may not be necessary to submit him self to any blood test or other pathological tests.\t [Para 50]\n\nIf the Court for the purpose envisaged under Order 32, Rule 15 of Code of Civil Procedure or Section 41 of the Indian Lunacy Act can do it suo motu, there is no reason why it cannot do so on an application filed by party to the marriage. Even otherwise the Court may issue an appropriate direction so as to satisfy himself as to whether apart from treatment he requires adequate protection inter alia by way of legal aid so that he may not be subject to an unjust order because of his incapacity. Keeping in view of the fact that in a case of mental illness the Court has adequate power to examine the party or get him examined by a qualified doctor, we are of the opinion that in an appropriate case the Court may take recourse to such a procedure even at the instance of the party to the lis. Furthermore, the Court must be held to have the requisite power even under Section 115 of Code of Civil Procedure to issue such direction either suo motu or otherwise which, according to him, would lead to the truth.\t [Para 51,52,53]"

Passing of such an order by the court would not be in violation of the right to personal liberty under Act 21 of the Constitution.  [Para 85]\n\nIn all such matrimonial cases where divorce is sought, say on the ground of impotency, schizophrenia ...etc. normally without there being medical examination, it would be difficult to arrive at a conclusion as to whether the allegation made by his spouse against the other spouse seeking divorce on such a ground, is correct or not. In order to substantiate such allegation, the petitioner would always insist on medical examination. If respondent avoids such medical examination on the ground that it violates his/her right to privacy or for a matter right to personal liberty as enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, then it may in most of such cases become impossible to arrive at a conclusion. It may render the very grounds on which divorce is permissible nugatory. Therefore, when there is no right to privacy specifically conferred by Article 21 of the Constitution of India and with the extensive interpretation of the phrase \"personal liberty\" this right has been read into Article 21, it cannot be treated as absolute right. What is emphasized is that some limitations on this right have to be imposed and particularly where two competing interests clash. In matters of aforesaid nature where the legislature has conferred a right upon his spouse to seek divorce on such grounds, it would be the right of that spouse which comes in conflict with the so-called right to privacy of the respondent. Thus the Court has to reconcile these competing interests by balancing the interests involved.\t [Para 80]\n\nIf for arriving at the satisfaction of the Court and to protect the right of a party to the lis who may otherwise be found to be incapable of protecting his own interest, the Court passes an appropriate order, the question of such action being violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of India would not arise. The Court having regard to Article 21 of the Constitution of India must also see to it that the right of a person to defend himself must be adequately protected.\t [Para 81]"

Treating wife\u2019s body as something owing to husband and committing sexual act against her will is nothing but marital rape. Right to respect for his or her physical and mental integrity encompass bodily integrity, any disrespect or violation of bodily integrity is a violation of individual autonomy. Autonomy essentially refers to a state of feeling or condition one believes to possess having control over it. In matrimony, spouse possesses such privacy as invaluable right inherent in him or her as individual. Therefore, marital privacy is intimately and intrinsically connected to individual autonomy and any intrusion, physically or otherwise into such space would diminish privacy. This essentially would constitute cruelty. Merely for the reason that the law does not recognise marital rape under penal law, it does not inhibit the court from recognizing the same as a form of cruelty to grant divorce. We, therefore, are of the view that marital rape is a good ground to claim divorce.\t(Para 13)"

                "description": "Divorce by mutual consent - Withdrawal of consent - Held, no spouse can unilaterally, wilfully be allowed to withdraw consent even on grounds such as fraud, undue force unless grounds are proved satisfactorily.\n\nThe Petitioner, by making representation that he was agreeable for divorce by mutual consent provided - respondent-wife withdraws her criminal complaint, returns his ornaments given to her in the marriage and takes care and custody of the minor child with limited access to him. The said representation made by the husband was accepted and acted upon by the respondent- wife to her prejudice. She withdrew criminal complaint filed against the husband and his family members. She returned ornaments received by her in the marriage.  She agreed to have a custody of the minor son and on the top of it waived present and future right to claim maintenance for herself as well as for minor son. Thus, it is clear like a day light that the respondent- wife acted to her prejudice by accepting terms of compromise favourable to the petitioner-husband. The husband is, thus, estopped from withdrawing his consent.  The Family Court cannot be helpless spectator and duplicity of the petitioner-husband to induce the hapless wife, the respondent to waive maintenance claim for not only herself and her son, also compelled her to withdraw the criminal complaint in the hope of starting her life afresh. The husband by his conduct has caused the wife huge disadvantage. No spouse can unilaterally, wilfully be allowed to withdraw consent even on the grounds; such as fraud, undue force, representation unless grounds are proved satisfactorily. In the present case, if the withdrawal of consent by the petitioner-husband is upheld, it will cause anamolous situation and serious prejudice to the respondent-wife, who is law abiding person. She will be left high and dry without recourse to any remedy and saddled with dead marriage. The respondent-husband has resorted to fraud and misrepresentation which cannot be permitted by the Courts of Law and equity.  The Family Court has rightly taken into account the wrong sought to be done by the husband and his attempt to cheat his wife depriving her an opportunity to work out and regulate the life of herself and her son in a fresh air. A pedantic interpretation of law might result in a situation resulting in gross miscarriage of justice in denying a woman with her abandoned son an opportunity to start their life afresh as stated.

                "description": "Enhanced maintenance in changed circumstances - Application for, under Section 25(2) after having received Rs.30,000 in full and final settlement of her claim for maintenance - Maintainability - Held, grant of maintenance under Section 25(1), incidental to decree granting substantial relief under Act - Right of maintenance, a continuing right even after grant of decree under Act - Quantum of maintenance variable from time to time in light of changed circumstances of either party - Court, if satisfied that there is a change in circumstances of either party at any time after granting maintenance under Section 25(1), it may at instance of either party vary, modify or rescind such order passed under sub-section (1) - Appeal against dismissal of application, by Family Court, allowed. Family Courts Act (1984), S.19.\n\nSection 25(1) of the Act provides for grant of a  gross sum or monthly or periodical sum towards maintenance on an application made by the wife or husband for a term not exceeding the life of the applicant taking into consideration the factors specified thereunder. Sub-section (1) of Section 25 makes it clear that such an order may be passed by the Court exercising the jurisdiction under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 at the time of passing any decree or at any time subsequent thereto. In other words, grant of maintenance under Section 25(1) is incidental to the decree granting substantial relief under the Act. Sub-section (2) of Section 25 provides that if the Court is satisfied that there is a change in the circumstances of either party at any time after granting maintenance under sub-section (1), the Court may at the instance of either party vary, modify or rescind such order passed under sub-section (1).   [Para 22]\n\nThe object of granting maintenance under Section 25 (1) is to enable the applicant, either the wife or the husband who has no independent income sufficient for her or his support, to maintain her/himself as per the status and economical condition of the other party. Sub-section (2) of Section 25 further empowers the Court to vary or revise the quantum of maintenance granted under sub-section (1) if there is any change in the circumstances of the parties. On a combined reading of sub-sections (1) & (2), it is clear that the right of maintenance is a continuing right even after a decree is granted under the Act and the quantum of maintenance is variable from time to time if there is change in the circumstances of either party.   [Para 23]\n\nIn the instant case permanent alimony as agreed between the parties was granted to wife while granting a decree of divorce and the same was complied with. The said order passed in I.A.No.540 of 2003, dated 6.10.2004, was admittedly made under sub-section (1) of Section 25 of the Act. If that be so, it is always open to the wife to seek enhancement of maintenance under Section 25(2) provided the changed circumstances are established to the satisfaction of the Court. Ex.P-2 settlement under which the wife agreed not to claim any further maintenance, does not preclude the Court to exercise the discretion conferred under sub-section (2) of Section 25 of the Act if the Court is satisfied as to change in the circumstances of the wife.

In the event of divorce or desertion, she is entitled for her Stridhan and her claim in respect thereof, if proved, must be allowed and necessary directions to return the same must be issued by the courts. In the present case, there is no dispute that the certain ornaments were gifted to the appellant by her parents in the marriage, as stated by her in her written statement and in her evidence. The respondent has also deposed that some ornaments were gifted by him at the time of marriage to the appellant. The appellant in her written statement and in her evidence, however, has made reference only to the ornaments/gifts made by her parents as Stridhan. There are six articles, mentioned in paragraph 11(O) of the written statement and in paragraph 23 of her deposition, as Stridhan. She has not claimed ornaments/gifts made by the respondent in the marriage as Stridhan. According to the respondent, all the ornaments were taken away by her while leaving the house. As against this, the appellant in her examination-in-chief has deposed that when she left the house the respondent and his relatives removed her all ornaments and refused to return them. This all happened when she last left the matrimonial home in June, 1996. Since then till the complaint under section 498-A was filed by her in October, 1997 and/or till she filed the written statement in the present case on 23.6.1998 she did not complain to the police about the alleged removal of her ornaments. The appellant, who had approached police on several occasions, would have definitely approached the police either immediately or atleast within a reasonable time and lodged complaint against the respondent and his family members for snatching her all ornaments. It has come in evidence that when she left the house, she left it with her father who was accompanied by his four friends, still no complaint regarding the alleged removal of ornaments was made and she kept quite for almost one and half year. Moreover, though the appellant has deposed that her ornaments were removed by the respondent and his family members, the father of the appellant who was also present with the appellant at that time, has not stated in his deposition about the alleged removal of ornaments. The appellant could have examined an independent witness, viz. one of the friends of her father who was present at the relevant time. The appellant has miserably failed to prove that she was not allowed to take away her Stridhan while leaving the house and it is still with the respondent and his family members. Learned counsel for the appellant took the Court through the relevant portion of the evidence in support of the appellant's claim regarding Stridhan. However, was satisfied that there is no evidence on record to hold that the appellant's stridhan was retained by the respondent when she left the matrimonial home last.  [Para 22]"

Article 39 (e) provides for ensuring health and strength for women. Keeping in mind the \"Laxman Rekha\" in the matter of interpretation of provisions of Personal Laws - qua the Constitution, the above constitutional provisions obligate the State for uplifting the women and secure descent living for them. Rule 75 provides for grant of pension even to the second wife/widow of a deceased railway servant along with first wife. This provision of Rule 75 made by the Indian Railways cannot be held to be in conflict or interdiction with Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act. On the contrary, for achieving the constitutional goal, as aforesaid, even for the unfortunate second wife/widow, Rule 75 provides for grant of pension to her for her survival in life. At any rate, it must be seen that by virtue of Rule 75, the payment of pension to the two widows is required to be made in equal share, which clearly shows that there is no burden on the treasury or the Indian Railways by inserting the said noble idea. There is no reason for us to hold that Rule 75 violates Section 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, or that it is contrary to the Hindu Marriage Act, since it does not even remotely provides for any contradiction or interdiction therewith.

                "description": "Allotment of tenements - Demand of additional price from allottees - Validity - In view of bar contained in Cl.2(w) of Hire Purchase Tenancy Agreement, Board cannot demand additional price from allottees after 7 years of allotment of tenement irrespective of justification for such revision.\n\nA conjoint reading of the allotment letter and clause 2 (w) of the Hire Purchase Tenancy Agreement, which every allottee is required to execute makes it clear that the price of the tenement specified in the allotment letter is tentative and the Board can revise the price after receiving final bills representing the cost of construction or if as a result of an order of the Court or an award made by the Arbitrator it is required to pay higher cost for the land used for construction of the tenements. In either case, the allottee is bound to pay the additional amount which would represent the final price of the tenement. If the cost of land is enhanced for any other similar reason then too the Board can revise the price and ask the allottees to pay additional price. In a given case, the Board may revise the tentative price more than once and the allottees are bound to share the burden of additional cost. However, the Board's power to revise the price of the tenements is hedged with the limitation of 7 years contained in clause 2(w) of the Hire Purchase Tenancy Agreement. That clause contained an express bar against the change in price after 7 years of the allotment of tenement. To put it differently, in view of the bar contained in clause 2(w) of the Hire Purchase Tenancy Agreement, the Board could not revise the price after 7 years of the allotment of tenement, irrespective of the justification for such revision. The Board's understanding of the prohibition contained in clause 2 (w) of the Hire Purchase Tenancy Agreement is evinced from Resolution dated 10.5.1989 wherein it was clearly mentioned that enhanced cost is not to be recovered from the allottees after 7 years from the date of allotment\n\nWhile preparing the format of Hire Purchase Tenancy Agreement, the Board must have taken into consideration various factors which could lead to an increase in the cost of tenements and consciously incorporated a prohibition against change in the price after 7 years from the date of allotment of tenements. The rationale of this embargo was that once the allottee pays the total price, he may not be subjected to the burden of additional cost after a number of years. Surely, adjudication of the landowners' claim for higher compensation is not within the domain of the Board or the allottees but once the Board has, after due deliberations, incorporated a prohibition against change in the price after a period of 7 years from the allotment of tenements, there is no reason why it should not be asked to honour the commitment made to the allottees that they will not live under the fear of being asked to pay additional price after an indefinite period. The use of the expression 'or enhancement in cost of land on any account' after the expression 'the receipt of the final bill for the construction of tenements or as the result of land award or arbitration proceeding' shows that while framing the regulations, the Board had kept in view all the eventualities which could lead to an increase in the cost of land made available for construction of the tenements and yet it thought proper to put an embargo against the revision of price after 7 years. Therefore, the learned Single Judge and the Division Bench of the High Court were not right in deciding the writ petitions and the writ appeals on the premise that once the cost of land gets increased on account of payment of higher compensation to the landowners the Board is entitled to demand additional price from the allottees.

This was obviously in a case where no express permission to re-marry was given. However, we find that the Hindu Widows' Remarriage Act, 1856 was repealed by Parliament by enacting the Hindu Widows' Re-Marriage (Repeal) Act, 1983. Therefore the reliance on section 2 of the Hindu Widows' Re-Marriage Act, 1856 is wholly misplaced.\n\nSection 14 of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 inter alia stipulates that the property of a female Hindu is to be her absolute property. Section 14(1) categorically states that any property possessed by a female Hindu, whether acquired before or after the commencement of the Act, shall be held by her as full owner thereof and not as a limited owner. The explanation to section 14(1) clarifies that property includes both movable and immovable property acquired by a female Hindu by inheritance or devise, or at a partition, or in lieu of maintenance or arrears of maintenance or by gift from any person, whether a relative or not, before, at or after her marriage, or by her own skill or exertion, or by purchase or by prescription, or in any other manner whatsoever etc. Provision in Hindu Succession Act, 1956 in pari materia with section 2 of the Hindu Widows' Re-Marriage Act, 1856. In other words, there is no provision that disqualifies a widow of a male Hindu from inheriting from her husband if she remarries, after his death.  [Para 5,8]"

However, with the advent of Act of 1956, which materially altered the Hindu Personal Law with regard to the succession, the widow has been placed as a Class I heir of her husband in the Schedule. In other words, by virtue of a widow being a Class I heir in the Schedule, under Act of 1956, she would be entitled to succeed to the entire share of her deceased husband in the joint property or ancestral property of the family with the same magnitude of estate, which her husband would have got had he been alive. In other words, her right to get an estate after the death of her husband like that of other coparceners in the family has been fully recognized and accepted by the Act of 1956. The concept of limited right or the concept of reversion after her death also stood abolished upon enactment of the Act of 1956 and as a result, she can deal with the property of her husband without any threat of reversion of her estate to the family of her husband. The right, that was given by Section 3 (3) of the Act of 1937, however, was of limited extent, in that, after her death, the property would revert back to the family of her husband. there is fallacy in the argument in that, Section 3 (3) provides for a right to file a suit for partition because there was no right at all in a widow even for her survival to get the property of her husband. In order that she must survive or must have some source of income for maintenance, Section 3 (3) was engrafted with a view to have her share but then in terms of the personal law of Hindus, a limited right was given to her. As against it, the Act of 1956 provides for a full right to a widow to the share of her deceased husband without any restriction of putting limited right or for dealing with share of her husband as per her choice.         [Para 17,24]\n\nSui juris means \"one's own right.\" As discussed earlier, right to share has been given to a widow upon death of her husband as per the Act of 1956, which was as per Section 3 (3) of the Act of 1937 of limited nature.

In the instant matter, in view of the law governing entitlement to the estate, it is to be noted that defendants, who are successors of deceased Noorbi who died during life time of Ajijabi, cannot claim any right or entitlement to the property left by deceased Ajijabi.  The question in respect of entitlement of the plaintiff or defendants by considering provisions of personal law governing the rights by way of succession is a domain of the Civil Court.  The Civil Court is, therefore, the only forum for rendering decision in that regard.  The alleged admission given in the succession proceedings is opposed to the law and as such, would not come in the way of the plaintiff.

They claimed possession from defendant on the ground that the petitioners were landlords and defendant was the tenant. The possession was claimed on the ground of failure to pay rent. Having failed to secure possession, Petitioners filed the suit under Hyderabad Atiyat Inquiries Act, 1952. In the earlier proceedings, Petitioners did not plead non applicability of Hyderabad Tenancy Act. In the earlier proceedings, the petitioners did not claim that the lands were service Inam lands. In the earlier proceedings, Petitioners did not plead that defendant was not entitled to claim tenancy rights as the lands in question were service Inam lands. In the earlier proceedings defendant was admitted to be a tenant. Under the circumstances, it was not open to the Petitioners to plead that the lands in question were service Inam lands and, therefore, defendant was not entitled to the status of being a tenant. The Atiyat Deputy Collector erred, therefore, in coming to the conclusion that defendant was not a tenant.  [Para 6]\n\nOn scrutiny of the provisions of the Hyderabad Tenancy Act, the Hyderabad Abolition of Inam Act and Hyderabad Atiyat Inquiries Act, it is clear that there is no bar on creation of tenancy by the Inamdar under the three enactments. On the contrary, the Hyderabad Tenancy Act divides the tenants into protected tenants and ordinary tenants. Tenants falling under sections 34, 37 or 37-A are protected tenants while others are ordinary tenants. In the circumstances, the Circular dated 9/8/1955 seeks to protect the tenants who are cultivating Inam Lands. Hence, although the Circular does not confer status of tenant on a person, still, in cases where the cultivator is in possession for last several years, security of tenor is granted to such cultivator on his payment of rent. In the circumstances, it could not be contended by the Petitioners that the Circular overrides section 102A of the Hyderabad Tenancy Act. Defendant as an ordinary tenant, was certainly entitled to be protected from eviction. Hence, in such cases, the Circular is squarely applicable.  [Para 6]"

So, it is the duty of the Atiyat Deputy Collector to find out who was the successor as per the personal law applicable to last holder for appointment as Archak or Inamdar. That function cannot be delegated to the Tahsildar. On making such appointment as successor , the function of the Atiyat Court would have come to an end, which was started on the basis of resignation of last holder. At that time, at that stage, there was no reason for the Atiyat Deputy Collector to go into the question whether tenant was legally inducted as tenant and whether he should be dispossessed from the land in question. However, without any reason, the Atiyat Deputy Collector also passed the order that the land be taken into possession and it be leased out on yearly basis by auction.The State Government gets a right to resume the Atiyat grant by following the provisions of section 5 of the said Act. But, here, there was no enquiry under section 5 of the said Act and therefore there was no question of resuming the grant by the Government. The grant was not resumed. On the contrary, it was contemplated to appoint some another Archak or Pujari to render the services to the deity. So, when there was no resumption of the grant,the Government had no authority to take the land in possession or to dispossess Punjaba, the tenant of the land.
