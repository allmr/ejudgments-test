It shoulders the great responsibility of maintaining law and order and public order in the society. People repose great faith and confidence in it. It must be worthy of that confidence. A candidate wishing to join the police force must be a person of utmost rectitude. He must have impeccable character and integrity. A person having criminal antecedents will not fit in this category. Even if he is acquitted or discharged in the criminal case, that acquittal or discharge order will have to be examined to see whether he has been completely exonerated in the case because even a possibility of his taking to the life of crimes poses a threat to the discipline of the police force. The Standing Order, therefore, has entrusted the task of taking decisions in these matters to the Screening Committee. The decision of the Screening Committee must be taken as final unless it is mala fide.\n\nCompromises or settlements have to be encouraged to bring about peaceful and amiable atmosphere in the society by according a quietus to disputes. They have to be encouraged also to reduce arrears of cases and save the litigants from the agony of pending litigation. But these considerations cannot be brought in here. In order to maintain integrity and high standard of police force, the Screening Committee may decline to take cognizance of a compromise, if it appears to it to be dubious. The Screening Committee cannot be faulted for that.\n\nThe respondents are trying to draw mileage from the fact that in their application and/or attestation form they have disclosed their involvement in a criminal case. Disclosure of these facts in the application/attestation form is an essential requirement. An aspirant is expected to state these facts honestly. Honesty and integrity are inbuilt requirements of the police force. The respondents should not, therefore, expect to score any brownie points because of this disclosure.\n\nIf it is found by the Screening Committee that the person against whom a serious case involving moral turpitude is registered is discharged on technical grounds or is acquitted of the same charge but the acquittal is not honourable, the Screening Committee would be entitled to cancel his candidature. Stricter norms need to be applied while appointing persons in a disciplinary force because public interest is involved in it.\t\t\t\t           [Para 21,26,27,28]"

This aspect will certainly depend on the facts of each case. In a given case, for the purpose of benefit of the persons employed in an Embassy or Consulate (Foreign Mission), some portion of the premises may be permitted to be used by outsider and such outsider may be paying certain rent/licence fee/compensation to the Foreign Mission. In such situation, the activity of permitting such outsider to use the premises would qualify to be an incidental activity in aid of and for the benefit of the principal activity of the Foreign Mission. In such a situation, the agent of the Foreign Mission will certainly enjoy the immunity. However, there may be another case where an outsider may have been inducted for monetary consideration by permitting such outsider to use the premises of the Foreign Mission for conducting an activity completely unconnected with the Sovereign functions of a Foreign Nation. In such a situation, no immunity would be available and such a case will be governed by Sub-Article C of Article 31(1) of the Schedule to the 1972 Act. It is therefore unsafe to lay down any straight jacket formula for arriving at a conclusion that any activity of a Foreign Mission invariably enjoys immunity.  [Para 19]"

                "description": "Interpretation of provisions - Mischief Rule - Applicability - Provisions u/Ss.16, 17, 19 in issue do not admit, of any ambiguity - Those are very clear provisions indicating nature and extent of liability of Corporation to pay insurance indemnity to depositors - Provisions also clearly provide meaning and scope of terminology \"depositors\" - No interpretation either by resort to verbal semantics or by invitation to refer to legislative intent by pressing Mischief Rule, permissible. \n\nIn instant case petitioners are credit societies registered under Maharashtra co-operative Societies Act, 1960. They had questioned interpretation adopted by Deposit Insurance and Credit Guarantee Corporation (DICGC) in relation to provisions contained in Ss.16(1), 19, 21(2)(a) and (b) of the Act and proviso to sub-sec.10C of S.43A of Act 1949.\n\nAforesaid provisions deal with liability of DICGC in respect of insured deposits, manner of payment by corporation in case of winding up of insured banks.\n\nCourt opined that provisions in issue do not admit of any ambiguity. The DICGC, in terms of Section 16(1) of the said Act, is no doubt liable to pay 'every depositor of that bank an amount equal to the amount due to him in respect of his deposit' in that bank when order of liquidation or winding up of such bank is made. The second proviso to Section 16(1) of the said Act, however, limits the liability in that the 'total amount' payable by DICGC 'to any one depositor in respect of his deposit in that bank in the same capacity and in the same right' upto Rs.1,00,000/-. This means that if the deposits held by a depositor in the insured bank as on the date of winding up or liquidation is less than or upto Rs.1,00,000/-, then such depositor is entitled to avail insurance indemnity upto the entire extent of his deposit. However, if the deposits held exceed Rs.1,00,000/- in the same capacity and in the same right, then the insurance indemnity shall extend upto Rs.1,00,000/- only. Petitioners took plea that correct interpretation would require the DICGC to treat each of the numerous small investors /depositors who have invested / deposited amounts with the Petitioner Societies as 'one unit each'. Thereby, the DICGC would be bound to indemnify each such small investor / depositor to extent of Rs.1,00,000/- each.\n\nHowever, such interpretation would be inconsistent with objective of the Act. The phraseology employed in the second proviso like 'any one depositor', 'in respect of his deposit' and 'in the same capacity and in the same right' clarifies the position that the DICGC is no way concerned with the investors or depositors who may have invested or deposited with the Petitioners. The Petitioners, are no doubt depositors with the insured bank, which in the present case is the Respondent No. 6. Therefore, in view of the liquidation of Respondent No. 6 bank, the DICGC is liable to offer insurance indemnity to the Petitioners to the extent of Rs.1,00,000/-. There is no further obligation towards depositors / investors who may have made deposits / investments with the Petitioners. In the light of the clear provisions, it is futile to suggest any other interpretation either by resort to verbal semantics or by invitation to refer to the legislative intent and on the said basis press the mischief rule of interpretation Mere circumstances that premium is levied upon entire body of deposits, or that some hardship may occasion in individual cases, are not strictly speaking relevant to statutory interpretation.\t [Para 13,15,16,17,18,19]"

It cannot be said that the State has acted arbitrarily or unreasonably. If the possession of the State Government is protected by the Bombay Rent Act, its refusal to de-hire the premises cannot be said to be violative of article 14. Government has framed a policy for de-hiring of the premises. The policy adheres to the well known principles of seniority.  Simply because the petitioner's number is not likely to reach in near future, the policy cannot be branded as unreasonable.  [Para 10]\n\nCompulsory letting under rule 81 is not the same as requisitioning under rule 75-A. If the term 'requisition' has acquired any technical meaning during the two world-wars, it has been used in the sense of taking possession of property for the purpose of the State. or for such purposes as may be specified in the Statute authorising a public servant to take possession of private property for a specified purpose for a period in contra-distinction to acquisition of property by which title to the property gets transferred from the individual to the State or to a public body for whose benefit the property is acquired. In 'requisition' the property dealt with is not acquired by the State but is taken out of the control of the owner for the time being for certain specified purposes. Even for this limited purpose, however, the owner becomes entitled to compensation, because 'requisition' of the property amounts atleast to temporary deprivation of the property.

Rule 75-A of the Defence of India Rules enabled the provincial government to requisition any property when it was necessary or expedient so to do for securing the defence of British India, public safety, the maintenance of public order or efficient prosecution of the war or for maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the community. Clause (bb) of Rule 81 on the other hand provided for regulating the letting and sub-letting any accommodation and controlling of the rents of such accommodation. In the circumstances mentioned in the Rule, the government could compel a person to let any premises either generally or to any specified persons and also control the rent at which the premises were let either generally or when let to specified persons or in specified circumstances. Object and purposes of Rule 75-A and Rule 81 were different. While Rule 75-A authorised the government to requisition any premises for securing the defence of British India, public safety or other purpose mentioned in the rule, Rule 81 permitted the government to control letting or sub-letting of the premises and the rents either generally or for specified persons or in specified circumstances. Power under Rule 81 was similar to the power of control of housing accommodation and prevention of any unreasonable increase in the rent as also accommodation being required to be made available instead of being kept unused. It may be noted that under Rule 81, government could require the accommodation to be let either generally or to specified person or persons or classes of persons and not only to the government while Rule 75-A only permitted the accommodation to be requisitioned for government purposes. The requisitioning of the premises may come to an end when the purpose for which the premises which are requisitioned ceases to exist, while the letting made to any person in persuance of Rule 81 may continue till the contract continued or the Rule existed or any other protection granted to a tenant under any other Act (such as any Rent Control Act) continued.  [Para 7]\n\nConstitutional validity of the several Rent Control Acts passed by legislatures of different States has been upheld. It therefore cannot be contended that the legislature has no power to regulate or control the letting of the accommodation or the rent to be charged on letting. Power to regulate letting is different than the power to requisitioning any premises. Rule 81 of the Defence of India Rules relates to the power of controlling letting of premises; such power of regulation includes the power directing letting of any premises to specified person or persons or classes of persons or in specified circumstances.

Clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) are indicative of the nature of the power. Clause (i) envisages a situation of an error in an order, requirement or decision. Clause (ii) deals with exceptional cases, or cases of doubt or controversy. Clause (iii), applies where the layout on the ground varies with the layout in the Development Plan. Sub-clause (v) empowers the Commissioner to authorise the operational construction of a public service building or the use of an undertaking only for public utility purposes where he finds these to be reasonably necessary for public convenience and welfare, even if it is not permitted in any land use classification. The existence of a reasonable necessity, founded in public convenience and welfare is the touchstone. The regulations are made in the interests of planned development and are based on public interest. The power of relaxation is conditioned by public convenience and welfare. Relaxations cannot be allowed indiscriminately. Else a relaxation will swallow the rule. Such relaxations are not intended to subserve the interests of developers but to answer a genuine and pressing public need. Unfortunately this is lost sight of and relaxations are granted to obviate compliance with the intent and spirit of development rules. That is a perversion of planning. No law can permit it. Judicial interpretation cannot countenance it.  [Para 10]"

                "description": "Eviction petition on ground of bona fide requirement - Delay in filing leave to defend - Rejection of application for leave to contest - Cannot be allowed by invoking provisions of Limitation Act.\n\nIn the instant case, the landlord filed an eviction petition under Section 14(1)(e) of the Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 before the Rent Controller, for eviction of the Tenant. After filing of the eviction proceeding, summons was issued in compliance with Section 25(3)(a) of the Act to the tenant/respondent to appear before the Rent Controller on a specified date for the purpose of defending the eviction proceeding. The tenant/respondent filed an affidavit by way of an application praying for leave to defend the eviction proceeding after delay of 8 days from the date of service of notice upon him. By an order dated 28th of February, 2001, the Affidavit (the application for leave to defend) was rejected by the Additional Rent Controller as it was filed 8 days beyond the date mentioned in the summons. Since there was a delay of 8 days, Additional Rent Controller held that under the Act, he was not conferred with any power to condone the delay in filing such affidavit. Since the prayer for leave to defend the proceeding was rejected as a follow up action, an eviction order was passed by the Additional Rent Controller, Delhi in favour of the landlord in compliance with sub-section (4) of Section 25-B of the Act.\n\nHeld that, order of Rent controller was not justified. From a careful perusal of sub-section (4) of Section 25-B of the Rent Act, it would be clearly evident that the tenant shall not be permitted to contest the prayer for eviction unless he files an affidavit before the Controller stating the ground on which he seeks to contest the application for eviction and obtains leave from the Controller. This Section also clearly indicates that in default of his appearance in compliance with the summons or his obtaining such leave, the statement made by the landlord in the eviction proceeding shall be deemed to be admitted by the tenant and the landlord shall be entitled to an order for eviction on the ground mentioned in the eviction petition. Also, R.23 of Delhi Rent Control Rules (1959) cannot be applied, because of applicability of Section 25-B, which is a special code and specific procedure for eviction of a tenant by a landlord on the ground of bona fide requirement, and it cannot be said that in view of Rule 23 of the Rules, the provisions of the Civil P.C. can be applied in the present case and, therefore, the High Court had acted illegally and with material irregularity in the exercise of its jurisdiction in setting aside the order of eviction and in allowing the affidavit filed by the tenant for the purpose of defending the proceedings for eviction. Thus, the High Court has acted illegally and with material irregularity in the exercise of its jurisdiction in affirming the order of the Additional Rent Controller whereby the Additional Rent Controller had allowed the application for setting aside the order of eviction and restored the application for leave to contest the eviction proceeding when such power, in our view, was not conferred on the Rent Controller to entertain such an application filed by the tenant/respondent. There is another aspect of this matter. It is difficult to understand how an application for leave to contest having been rejected, may be on the ground of delay, could be allowed when it is not disputed by the tenant respondent that no application for condonation of delay could be entertained by the Rent Controller as the provisions of the Limitation Act, 1963 could not be attracted. Consequently, the order of eviction passed by the Additional Rent Controller stands restored, the impugned order of the High Court is set aside and the application filed by the landlord under Section 14(1)(e) of the Act stands allowed.

The very exemption order which has also been set out by us (supra) again refers only to bulk drugs and formulations based thereupon which are \"manufactured\" by the company. Further, a reading of the guidelines of 1989 also makes it clear that the exemption only relates to manufacture and has no reference to sale whatsoever.  [Para 8]\n\nIt will be noticed that the reference is to the date of commencement of commercial production of a bulk drug which has reference to manufacture alone. However, reference made to sub-clause (viii) of the guidelines of 1989 in order to argue that after the expiry of the period of exemption, the manufacturer has to submit an application for fixation of the price of a bulk drug under the provisions of the DPCO.\t [Para 9]\n\nSub-clause (viii) of Guidelines of 1989 cannot be read in isolation but must be read as a part of the entire scheme of the guidelines. All that sub-clause (viii) says is that after the period of exemption, which is after the period which has reference to manufacture and not sale of goods, such goods as are manufactured after the exemption will be subject to the drill of sub-clause (viii). Read in this light, arguments based on this sub-clause, rejected.  [Para 10]\n\nIt can be seen that the issue that arose in the Glaxosmithkline case [(2014) 2 SCC 753] was completely different from the issue that arose in Ranbaxy's case [(2008) 7 SCC 502] and the present case. Ranbaxy's case and the present case are directly concerned only with an exemption notification, and not a notification for fixation of price. Also, what is relevant for an exemption notification is the manufacture of drugs, whereas what is relevant for a price fixation notification relates to sale and not manufacture. Obviously, therefore, the Glaxosmithkline decision would have no relevance to the facts of the present case (2008) 7 SCC 502 Rel. on. (2014) 2 SCC 753 Dist.  [Para 13]"

As regards registration etc.. done under the old Act, sub-section (2) clearly lays down that it shall continue to be in force and have effect as if done under the corresponding provisions of the new Act.  This means that registration of the design must continue in force and have effect as a thing done under section 4 of the Act.  It is, therefore, clear that the intention of Parliament is that all things done under the old Act can only be continued to be in force and have effect as if made under the corresponding provision of the new Act.  The only exception made in section 48 is provided in sub-section (4) which provides that any proceeding pending in any Court at the commencement of the new Act may be continued in that Court as if the new Act had not been passed.  It is, therefore, clear that Parliament intended that all things done under the old Act, after the enactment of the new Act be governed only by the new Act, the old Act being completely repealed.\n\nIn particular, as regards the question of registration and its cancellation, the Statement of Objects and Reasons for the new Act throws light on the intention of Parliament to govern these matters according to the new Act of 2000.\n\nIt is obvious, that it was the avowed intent of Parliament to provide for new ground for cancellation of registration so as to include prior publication in any other country and also to bring about changes in the conditions for registration of designs vide clause 5.  It appears that it is the intention of Parliament to specifically consider the question of prior publication \"on global basis instead of regional basis i.e. in India\" vide clause 19.  It is therefore clear that it is the intention of Parliament that all matters pertaining to registration and its cancellations are intended to be governed by the new Act i.e. the Designs Act, 2000 and not the old Act i.e. the Designs Act, 1911.

Section 51-A(1)(b) makes an exception and provides that within one year from the date of registration of the design, an application could be made for cancellation of the registration to the Controller on the grounds specified in Sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of Clause (a). Section 51-A(2) provides that an appeal from the order of the Controller would lie to the High Court. The cause of action for the instant proceedings is most certainly the cancellation of the registered design of the appellant which happened in the State of West Bengal which gave the Calcutta High Court the jurisdiction to deal with the matter. The Delhi High Court, erred in holding that the cause of action had arisen within its local jurisdiction, whereas the jurisdiction of the High Court was on account of the cancellation of registration of the design and not on account of the impact thereof in any particular State. Thus, the High Court was led into error in holding that the consequence of the cancellation gave jurisdiction to the Delhi High Court to entertain the suit, without considering in its proper perspective the provisions of Section 51-A of the 1911 Act in contrast to the provisions of Section 19 of the 2000 Act.

[Para 19,22,23,25]\n\nAlso, In contrast to the provisions of Section 51-A(1)(a) of the 1911 Act, Section 19(1) of the 2000 Act, which also deals with cancellation of registration, provides for a petition for cancellation of registration of a design to be filed before the Controller and not to the High Court. On a comparison of the two provisions of the two enactments, it will be obvious that under the 2000 Act the intention of the Legislature was that an application for cancellation of a design would lie to the Controller exclusively without the High Court having a parallel jurisdiction to entertain such matters. It is also very clear that all the appeals from any order of the Controller under Section 19 of the 2000 Act shall lie to the High Court. The basic difference, therefore, as was pointed out to the High Court and noticed by it, is that while under Section 19 of the 2000 Act an application for cancellation would have to be made to the Controller of Designs, under Section 51-A of the 1911 Act an application could be preferred either to the High Court or within one year from the date of registration to the Controller on the grounds specified under Sub-clauses (i) and (ii) of Clause (a) of Section 51-A(1). Under Section 19 of the 2000 Act the power of cancellation of the registration lies wholly with the Controller. On the other hand, an application for cancellation of a design could be made directly to the High Court under Section 51-A of the 1911 Act. Under the 2000 Act, the High Court would be entitled to assume jurisdiction only at the appellate stage, whereas under Section 51-A of the 1911 Act the High Court could itself directly cancel the registration.

The said Act is referable to Article 39 (b) of the Constitution of India. The DPCOs provide a price control mechanism by which the Government seeks to control the prices of drugs so that the ultimate beneficiary is the consumer who then stands to get the drug in question at an affordable and reasonable price. The concept of the retention price, pool price and the selling price is, therefore, encompassed in the DPCOs. The DPCOs by the said price fixing mechanism, inter alia, provide for fixing the profit margins which a manufacturer would be entitled to. The said price fixation is done by controlling the prices of the bulk drug which is used in the formulation by the manufacturer. This was done, in the context of the present petition, by the method prescribed by under para 11 of the DPCO, 1979. The retail price fixed for a formulation allows a manufacturer a particular price at which he can buy the ingredient bulk drug. If he buys the drug at a lower price than the price allowed, he has to deposit in the DPEA the difference between the price allowed and the lower price at which he has bought the bulk drug. By this process, an equilibrium is sought to be struck by the Government so that the manufacturer gets the bulk drug at the controlled price resulting in the retail price of the bulk drug being controlled in a fashion so as to benefit the ultimate consumer.                          \t\t\t                                                                                                                          [Para 17]"

The concept of 'reasonable opportunity' is by now well established. One of the facets of such 'reasonable opportunity' would be that the party which is proposed to be proceeded against, has to be furnished with all the adverse material, upon which reliance is proposed to be placed for the purposes of arriving at the impugned decision. Unless the party is made known to the adverse material proposed to be used against it, the party would be deprived of reasonable opportunity to show cause against the same or to explain the same. Negatively stated that this principle means and implies that no adverse material of which the party has been given no notice ought to be used by the decision maker in making the impugned decision. In the present case, as shall be demonstrated hereafter, in making the impugned order, the Administrator has indeed made reference to and relied upon some adverse material against the Councillors and the Council, without the Councillors or the Council having effective opportunity to meet with the same. The facts constituting gravamen of charge have to be communicated. It follows as a necessary corollary therefrom that what has not been communicated or not relied on in the show cause notice as a ground providing reason for the proposed removal cannot be relied upon as furnishing basis for the order of removal. The person proceeded against, has to be made aware of the precise charge which is required to meet and therefore he must be apprised of the exact content of the abuse of power attributed to him. The authority taking the decision must apply its mind also to the explanation furnished by the person proceeded against and this must appear from the order made.          [Para 15,20]\n\nThe requirement of recording reasons is also one of the facets of natural justice. Reason is the very life of law. When the reason of law once ceases, the law itself generally ceases, such is the significance of the reasoning in any rule of law. Giving reasons furthers the cause of justice as well as avoid uncertainty and helps in observance of law of precedent. When reasons are announced and can be weighed, the public can have assurance that the process of correction is in place and working . Reasons for an order would ensure and enhance public confidence and would provide due satisfaction to the consumer of justice under our justice dispensation system.\n\nThe Council or the Councillors are also required to respond to show cause notice under Section 298 of the said Act with utmost despatch and seriousness. In matters of this nature, a Council or councillors are not expected to adopt any dilatory approach.         [Para 23,24]"

However the offence in question was committed under NDPS Act. Held, the requirement of furnishing one copy of the report of the Government Analyst to a person from whom the sample is collected under Section 25(2), is in respect of the samples collected in exercise of the powers under Chapter-IV of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940. That is amply clear from sub-section (1) of Section 25 which refers to Section 23(4) of the Act of 1940. Section 23 in turn opens with the expression that where an inspector takes any sample of a drug or cosmetic under that chapter of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. This pre-supposes that the provisions of Section 25 will be attracted only in respect of action taken by the Inspector appointed under the Act of 1940; and which action is in exercise of powers thereunder and not otherwise. The question of issuing writ directing respondent authority to furnish one copy of the Government Analyst report to the petitioner under Drugs and Cosmetics Act does not arise.\n\nSection 80 of the NDPS Act envisages that the provisions in that Act or the rules made thereunder shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of the Act of 1940 or the rules made thereunder. The question of applicability of S.25 of 1940 Act, even in a case under NDPS Act, may arise in a case where the collection of samples was by the Inspector appointed under that Act. That is not the case. This interpretation cannot be said to be in derogation of the provisions of the Act of 1940. The provisions in section 80 of the NDPS Act cannot be made the basis to issue direction to the authorised officer under the NDPS Act to comply with the procedure provided in the Act of 1940.

This subsection contemplates two forums to be approached by the accused within 28 days from the receipt of a copy of the report of the Government Analyst. First, the Inspector and the second is the Court before whom the proceedings in respect of the sample are pending. The accused is entitled to approach any one of the above referred authorities within the stipulated period of 28 days and since in the instant case, the accused has approached the Inspector within 28 days, as contemplated by sub-section (3) of section 25 of the Act, it cannot be said that there was any delay whatsoever on the part of the accused to move the authority concerned as contemplated under sub-section (3) of Section 25 of the Act. Therefore, it was not only necessary but incumbent upon the Drug Inspector to immediately move the Magistrate, as contemplated under sub-section (4) of Section 25 of the Act, for necessary direction. However, in the instant case, the Drug Inspector did not do anything inspite of the intimation. The inaction on the part of the concerned officer results in depriving the citizens from exercising their available statutory rights which ultimately adversely affects the prosecution and the Courts are required to quash the same.

Both these Sections speak about the offences committed by the companies. If these two Sections are carefully read, there is no manner of doubt that the vicarious liability of a person for being prosecuted for an offence committed under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, and Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, by a company arises if, at the relevant time, he was in charge of and was also responsible to the company for the conduct of its business.  [Para 20]\n\nThe phraseology used in Section 34 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, and Section 17 of the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, has a special significance. A commission of offence by company under Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, and under Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, requires different treatment by virtue of Section 34 of the Act of 1940 and Section 17 of the Act of 1954. The phraseology used in Sections 34 of the Act of 1940, and Section 17 of the Act, 1954, conveys actual participation in day-to-day affairs of the company.  [Para 21]\n\nA person in charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company means that the person who effectively exercises all control of the day-to-day business of the company or firm. What is legally required is overall control over the day-to-day business of the company and the firm. If this element is present then only the directors of the company are responsible for the contravention of the provisions of Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940, and Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954.  [Para 22]\n\nIn both the cases in hand, except bald statement made in the complaints filed by the Drug Inspector and Food Inspector, there is no whisper in the complaints that the petitioners were in charge of and were also responsible to the companies for the conduct of the business of the companies. The Drug Inspector and the Food Inspector, have drawn a presumption with regard to involvement of the Directors of the company without any averments with regard to control of day-to-day business of the companies.  [Para 24]\n\nThe onus of proving that a particular director was in charge of and also responsible to the conduct of the business of the company, at the time of contravention of the provisions of Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, and Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954, is on the prosecution. If it is shown that a particular director has overall control over the day-to-day business of the company and he participates in the day-to-day affairs of the company then, in that event, there will be transformation of onus of proof from prosecution to the accused. In the instant case, the initial burden is not discharged by the prosecution.  [Para 31]"

In view of this, the contention of the petitioners that even if they did not notify their intention to get the sample re-tested from the Central Drugs Laboratory within 28 days of the receipt of report of Government Analyst, as contemplated under Section 25(3) of the Act, they have statutory right under section 25(4) of the Act to request the trial Court to send the sample to Central Drugs Laboratory for re-analysis on the date of their first appearance before the trial Court cannot be accepted. Therefore, rejection of application filed by accused persons is just and proper and does not call for  interference."

There is absolutely no merit in the submission that there is a discrimination between manufacturers of Homoeopathic and Ayurvedic medicines. Even on the assumption that a similar diversion of alcohol may conceivabley take place in the manufacture of Ayurvedic medicines, the argument of the Petitioner at the highest would be that the classification is under inclusive, but it is well settled that it is not necessary for the legislature to regulate every conceivable activity in order to regulate something. The legislature can recognize and distinguish between degrees of evil and regulate those areas where its intervention is most required. Such a classification cannot be regarded as arbitrary or unconstitutional. The submission that Rule 106-B has been brought into force without complying with mandatory procedural requirements is based on the allegation that the Drugs Technical Advisory Board did not have any representative with an expert knowledge in the field of Homoeopathy. The constitution of the Board is provided for in Section 5(2) of the Act. Hence, it would not be for the Court to mandate any change in the statutory provision relating to the Constitution of the Board. That is for the Parliament to best determine.\n  [Para 7,8,9]"

In other words, if any of the persons who receives a copy of the report of the Government Analyst fails to notify his intention to adduce evidence in controversion of the facts stated in the report within a period of 28 days of the receipt of the report, then such report of the Government Analyst could become conclusive evidence regarding the facts stated therein as against such persons.  But as for an accused, like the manufacturer in the present case, who is not entitled to be supplied with a copy of the report of the Government Analyst, he must have the liberty to challenge the correctness of the facts stated in the report by resorting to any other modes by which such facts can be disproved.  He can also avail himself of the remedy indicated in sub-section (4) of Section 25 of the Act by requesting the Court to send the other portion of the sample remaining in the Court to be tested at the Central Drugs Laboratory.  Of course no Court is under a compulsion to cause the said sample to be so tested if the request is made after a long delay.  It is for that purpose that a discretion has been conferred on the Court to decide whether such sample should be sent to the Central Drugs Laboratory on the strength of such request.  However, once the sample is tested at the Central Drugs Laboratory and a report as envisaged in Section 25(4) of the Act is produced in Court the conclusiveness mentioned in that sub-section would become incontrovertible.\t [Para 25]\n\nWhen the provisions can be interpreted in such a way as to avert absurd consequences in the manner indicated above it is not congenial to the interest of criminal justice to acquit the manufacturers of forbidden medicines or drugs on a technical ground that there is a lacuna in the legislation by not supplying copy of the report of the Government Analyst to the manufacturer in certain situations.  To adopt the course of acquitting such offending manufacturers only on the legislative lacuna (if at all it is lacuna) would be hazardous to public health and the lives of the patients to whom drugs are prescribed by medical practitioners would be in jeopardy.

The samples drawn must be sent for analysis forthwith.  Portions thereof must be given to  the concerned parties without loss of time.  Report must be prepared expeditiously.  It must be sent to the Inspector with expedition.  Copies of the report must be served on the concerned parties as soon as possible and complaint must be lodged without wasting time.  Reason for this expedition at every stage is the shelf-life of a drug and the need to get it analysed within a particular time frame.  While sub-section (1) of Section 24 of the Insecticides Act 1968, the Insecticide Analyst has to submit his report within a period of 60 days, surprisingly there is no such provision in the Act providing for an outer limit for submission of the report.  It is elementary that no complaint could be filed till such time as the report of the analyst is received.  If the report is delayed consequently the complaint would be delayed.  Delayed complaint may result in denying the accused or the complainant the right to get the samples tested from the Central Drugs Laboratory before the shelf-life of the drug is over.  That would frustrate the prosecution.  Prompt lodging of the complaint therefore is of prima importance.\n\nThere are no clear provisions in the Act indicating that when the sample is not drawn from the premises where it is manufactured, one portion of the sample should go to the manufacturer.  In such a case he has to divide the sample in 4 portions.  One portion is to be sent to a person whose name is disclosed under Section 18-A.  Section 18-A only requires a person not being a manufacturer to disclose name of the person from whom he has acquired the drug.  That may not necessarily be the accused.  In an enactment such as this one wishes, that to obviate  reducing the prosecution to a farce, the provisions would be more precise and accurate."

It is not available to the applicant to raise the defence that under Rule 65 as well as sub-clauses of the said Rule impose the duty on the licensee alone to maintain records and registers in the prescribed forms and for any contravention thereof it is the licensee alone who is responsible for such breach of Rule and is alone liable for prosecution. It must be borne in mind that the legislature thought it fit to prohibit every person whether he is a licensee himself or other person who is acting on behalf of such licensee (in whichever capacity) to sell any drug or cosmetic in contravention of any of the provisions of the Act and Rules made thereunder. Neither section 18 nor section 25 carves out any exception in this regard in favour of person who is acting on behalf of the licensee from the criminal liability. In absence thereof, it is not possible to exclude a person who is acting on behalf of the licensee and the act of such person contravenes the provisions of the Act and Rules, to be excluded from the Criminal liability under the provisions of the Act. The contention of the learned counsel for the applicant if accepted in this regard, would frustrate the scheme of sections 18 and 27 and, therefore, the same is rejected.\n\nThe purport of sections 18 and 27 is every person whether licensee agent or may be a qualified person, is prohibited from selling any drug in contravention of provisions of Act and Rules without any exception to this Rule and, therefore, all those who sell drug in contravention of the provisions of the Act and Rules are responsible for such contravention and can be proceeded against. Any other interpretation of sections 18, and 27, in my view would be totally inconsistent with the legislative intent as well as object and purpose for which these provisions are enacted by the legislature. For the reasons stated hereinabove, the contention canvassed by Shri Manohar, learned Counsel for the applicant in this regard is misconceived and devoid of substance.\t [Para 22,23]"

In view of the intention of the petitioners and the fact that the expiry date was fast approaching the Drugs Inspector should have taken positive steps to ensure that not only sample was sent at the earliest but he should have ensured that the sample was received by the Central Drugs Laboratory before the date of its expiry.  There is no prohibition under the Act or the Rules barring Inspector from sending sample direct to Central Drug Laboratory.  In the circumstances it has to be held that on account of inaction and lack of diligence on the part of the Drugs Inspector, the valuable right which is vested in the accused under Section 25(4) had been lost.  At any rate, the accused are not to be blamed at all in this process.  It may also be pointed out even when the sample was sent on 05.04.1994, the Drugs Inspector should have requested the Court that the sample in question be sent by hand delivery so that it was received by the Central Drugs Laboratory prior to the date of its expiry.  Hence the continuation of proceedings against the accused persons would amount to abuse of process of law and are required to be quashed.\t\t\t [Para 22,23,24]"

Preference could be given to those possessing the additional desirable qualification of research experience in the synthesis and testing of drugs in a research laboratory. Manufacture has been defined as a process for making, altering, ornamenting, finishing, packing, labelling, breaking up or otherwise treating or adopting any drug or cosmetic with a view to its sale or distribution. Therefore, the experience of testing has to be correlated to the manufacturing process which naturally will be entirely different from the testing carried out in the research and development laboratory before the product is released for manufacture and sale in the market. To say that experience in testing of drugs in a research and development laboratory would be at par with the testing done at the time of manufacture before sale cannot be countenanced and has to be rejected. The preference clause in Clause 4.7 only means that if a candidate with the required degree qualification and practical experience in the manufacturing and testing of drugs for stipulated period of years has an additional desirable attribute of a research experience in a research laboratory, other things being equal, preference could be given to such a candidate. The term \"preference\" mentioned in the advertisement cannot be interpreted to mean that merely because a candidate may have had the requisite experience of testing in a research and development laboratory he/she possessed the essential eligibility and had a preferential right to be considered for appointment. \n\n1996 (6) SCC 282 Rel. on. \t\t\t\t [Para 12,13,14]"

A bare reading of this provision would show, firstly, that it is without prejudice to any other provision contained in this Chapter (meaning thereby Chapter IV). This expression only means that apart from the Central Government's other powers contained in Chapter IV, Section 26A is an additional power which must be governed by its own terms. Under Section 26A, the Central Government must be \"satisfied\" that any drug or cosmetic is likely to involve (i) any risk to human beings or families; or (ii) that any drug does not have the therapeutic value claimed or purported to be claimed for it; or (iii) contains ingredients in such quantity for which there is no therapeutic justification. Obviously, the Central Government has to apply its mind to any or all of these three factors which has to be based upon its \"satisfaction\" as to the existence of any or all of these factors. The power exercised under Section 26A must further be exercised only if it is found necessary or expedient to do so in public interest. When the power is so exercised, it may regulate, restrict or prohibit manufacture, sale or distribution of any drug or cosmetic.\t [Para 15]\n\nUndoubtedly, Section 26A has to be read with the rest of the Drugs Act. So read, it is clear that unlike Section 6(2), Section 8(2), second proviso to Section 10, proviso to Section 12(1), Section 16(2), proviso to Section 18(2), Section 33 and Section 33N, there is no explicit requirement to consult the Drugs Technical Advisory Board (DTAB) set up under Section 5 of the Drugs Act. The question is did the Parliament do so deliberately or is it something that the Court should read into the provision?\t [Para 16]\n\n\tAs has been stated hereinabove, Section 26A was brought in by an amendment in 1982. The amendment specifically made changes in Sections 33 and 33N in which it added the words \"on the recommendation of the Board\". From this, it is clear that Parliament in the very Amendment Act which introduced Section 26A made certain changes which involved the DTAB under Section 5 of the said Act. It is clear that the additional power that is given to the Central Government under Section 26A does not refer to and, therefore, mandate any previous consultation with the DTAB. On the contrary, the Central Government may be \"satisfied\" on any relevant material that a drug is likely to involve any risk to human beings etc. as a result of which it is necessary in public interest to regulate, restrict or prohibit manufacture, sale or distribution thereof. So long as the Central Government's satisfaction can be said to be based on relevant material, it is not possible to say that not having consulted the DTAB, the power exercised under the said Section would be non est.

                "description": "Bringing drugs under price control - Fixation of annual turnover - It means domestic sales figures and nothing else - Export sales ought to be excluded while calculating the turnover.\n\n'Turnover' in its ordinary sense connotes amount of business usually expressed in terms of gross revenue transacted during a specified period (vide Collins Dictionary).  Broadly speaking, it represents the value of the goods or services sold or supplied during a period of time.  The amount of money turned over or drawn in a business during certain period, is another shade of meaning.  We need not refer to the definition of 'turnover' in Sales Tax and other fiscal enactments as they are not quite relevant for the purpose of understanding the expression 'turnover' occurring in a policy document.  Nor should we seek any assistance from the definition of 'sale turnover' occurring in DPCO in a different context and for a different purpose.  Going by its ordinary meaning and the way in which it is commonly understood in trade and commerce, it is difficult to equate turnover to the value of stock acquired either by means of imports or production.  For instance, the entire stock in trade, say, lying in a godown and not calculated in business, cannot be regarded as turnover, even giving broadest meaning to the expression 'turnover.'  The reasoning which could be spelt out from the order passed by NPPA and in the counter-affidavits filed by the appellants that indigenous production plus imports furnishes an indicia of the total business in the country in relation to a particular bulk drug, cannot be accepted.  It is only what is sold out and marketed that could be legitimately regarded as turnover of the specified drug.  It may be that in the absence of availability of reliable data regarding sales, the import value and production value could be the basis to estimate the sale value after giving due allowance to various factors such as wastage, unsold stocks etc.  But, treating the turnover as nothing but the value of stock produced or imported during a given period will be doing violence to the ordinarily accepted meaning of the expression 'turnover.'\t [Para 5.7]\n\nPara 9 of the Drug Policy, 1994 makes it clear that the high turnover of a drug is an index of its extent of usage.  'Usage' has obvious reference to consumption and consumption within the domestic market.  Whether the drug is extensively used within the country is one of the considerations kept in view to clamp price control.  The export potential of the drug or its usage in foreign countries could not have been the reason to notify the specified drugs for price control. If there is any doubt in this regard, it is dispelled by what is stated in paragraph 10 of the rejoinder affidavit which we quoted supra.  To repeat, it was stated therein that the intent behind using the word 'turnover' has been to determine the extent of usage of a bulk drug in the country.\t [Para 5.8]"

In such a situation one can sympathise with the plight of such students who for no fault of their own were to be dislodged. However, the compassion and sympathy has no role to play where a rule of law is required to be enforced. The High Court has rightly declined to issue any direction to the Central Government to grant one time increase in the admission capacity in the medical colleges, otherwise it would not have been proper exercise of jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. Adjusting equities in exercise of extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 is one thing, and the High Court assuming the role of the Central Government and the Medical Council under Section 10A of the Act is a different thing. The Court cannot direct to waive the mandatory requirement of law in exercise of its extraordinary power under Article 226. It is not permissible for the High Court to direct an authority under the Act to act contrary to the statutory provisions. The power conferred on the High Court by virtue of Article 226 is to enforce the rule of law and ensure that the State and other statutory authorities act in accordance with law. However, it does not mean that the High Court is powerless in that regard. It can do so only when it finds that there was some illegality in the order of the Central Government in refusing to increase the admission capacity in various colleges. The increase  in  admission  capacity  is permissible only when a scheme, in accordance with the regulations, is submitted by a medical college under Section 10A of the Act to the Central Government and the Medical Council is satisfied that the scheme complies with the requirement of the Act and regulations and thereafter   the   Medical   Council recommends for such an increase in admission capacity. So long as the requirements under Section 10A of the Act are not complied with, no permission can be granted by the Central Government. If any direction is issued by the High Court to the Central Government to increase the admission capacity in a medical college, it would be in the teeth of the statutory provisions and amounted to amending the provisions of Section 10A.

No.96 in the III Schedule to the Act is not valid.\n\nThough Mauras College is situated outside India, the BDS students of the Mauras College who successfully complete the course of study and pass the examination conducted by the Bhavnagar University possess the dental qualifications awarded by an authority in India (namely Bhavnagar University). They do not possess any dental qualification awarded by an authority or institution outside India. Section 10(4) of the Act will apply only if the dental qualification is granted by an authority or institution outside India, and as a consequence, such qualification will have to be listed under Part-III of the Schedule to the Act. The respondents do not dispute the fact that the BDS examinations for the students of Mauras College are held by Bhavnagar University and the degrees are also granted by Bhavnagar University and not by any authority or institution outside India. So long as the Mauras College is affiliated to Bhavnagar University and the said University is the examining body and is the authority which grants the BDS degree dental qualification to the students of Mauras College, Section 10(4) and Part-III of the Schedule to the Act will not apply. As Bhavnagar University is not an authority outside India, the dental qualifications granted by it cannot be included in Part-III of the Schedule to the Act even if the college/institution affiliated to the said University is outside India. Therefore the notification dated 6.3.2009 is illegal being contrary to and violative of section 10(1) and (4) of the Act and liable to be struck down.   [Para 11,12,19]"

The prayer was to set aside the orders passed by the authorities below. Even if the said petitions(s) were styled as a petition under Article 226, the content and the prayers thereunder being ones requiring exercise of supervisory jurisdiction only, could be treated as petitions filed under Article 227 of the Constitution only. The Court, while, exercising its powers under Article 227 ought to have confined itself to the subject matter and the issues raised by parties in the Writ Petition. The digression of or expansion of the supervisory jurisdiction under Article 227 would open precarious floodgates of litigation should the limitation on the supervisory jurisdiction not be observed mindfully. If for any reason, the Writ Court perceived the oral request made by the respondents to have justified the ends of justice and desired to accept the concession so made by the counsel for appellant-Society, the said request not being the subject matter of the Writ Petition required the Court to query whether the counsel for the appellant-Society has been authorized to make such a statement by the appellant-Society or whether any such resolution has been passed by the appellant-Society giving concession in matters of this nature. Since the required caution was not exercised by the learned Judges of the Writ Court, the directions issued by the Writ Court suffer from infirmity and hence require to be set aside.

In short, the provisions of the Tenancy Act are to be made applicable to the land held by the Government. It is not in dispute that the property in question, no doubt, stood vested in the Government, in pursuance of the provisions of the 1950 Act and, therefore, even if there happened to be a declaration under section 38E of the Tenancy Act in favour of the petitioner, that has to be totally ignored while applying the provisions of the 1950 Act and 1954 Act. Thus, even though a declaration is there in favour of the petitioner, that will have to be totally ignored for all practical purposes and the property will have to be held to be totally unencumbered into the hands either of the Custodian or the Settlement Commissioner under the provisions of 1950 Act or manager under the provisions of 1954 Act.\t\t\t\t\t [Para 13]"

Free surrender of 10% plots [if unsold and unbuilt] in such layout, is also a condition for enjoying the concession. Thus the owner or occupier of such plots regularized in gunthewari development cannot earn any T.D.R. in relation to such surrender. Purchase of otherwise valid T.D.R. by respective petitioners, is not in dispute. They are having necessary development rights certificate (DRC) and they have annexed the same along with their revised building plan for sanction. However, regulation no.29.10 shows that the D.R.C. is not valid for use on receivable plots in areas which are listed thereunder and identified as no T.D.R. zone. The fact that T.D.R. cannot be used in agricultural zone or prohibited zone or restricted zone, is apparent from Clause [f] of regulation no.29.10.\n\nUse of T.D.R. by persons like petitioners, whose developments have been regularized by showing leniency will add to mischief which is sought to be controlled or eradicated by enactment like Gunthewari Act, 2001. It may defeat proper up-gradation in gunthewari regularized areas. Drastic measures like surrender of even marginal space lying open to sky by plot owner/occupier to enable construction of public road and denial of compensation for such surrender in Gunthewari Act, itself prove inability of such owner/occupier to earn any TDR therefor. When Legislation has denied him TDR for land so surrendered during gunthewari regularization, the intent behind the same shall stand defeated, if TDR purchased elsewhere is allowed to be loaded on such gunthewari regularized plots.

R.5A.\n\n\tReview petitions are dealt with in Section 22(2)(e) read with Rule 5A of the Rules. Section 24, which applies the provisions of the Limitation Act to applications made to a Tribunal, would, as per the definition section contained in Section 2(b), apply only to applications that are made under Section 19, which are original applications to recover debts that are made by banks and financial institutions. What is clear is that an application for review cannot possibly be said to be an application filed under Section 19 even on a cursory reading of the provisions of the Act, as it traces its origin to Section 22(2)(e) read with Rule 5A of the Rules. \n\n\tAn appeal under Section 30(1) is an appeal to the Tribunal against orders of the Recovery Officer made under the Act. The reason why Rule 2(c) of the Rules defines application as including an application under Section 31A and an appeal filed under Section 31 of the Act, apart from applications filed under Section 19, is because under Rule 4 of the Rules, the procedure for filing such applications/appeal is under Forms I to III appended to the Rules. What is important to note is that even this extended definition, under the Rules, does not include an application for review filed under Rule 5A of the Rules. In point of fact, Rule 7 makes it abundantly clear that each such application, including applications for review, are viewed separately and independently, as fees payable for filing such applications are vastly different, as is clear from Rule 7(2).\n\n\tThe peremptory language of Rule 5A would also make it clear that beyond 30 days there is no power to condone delay. Rule 5A was added in 1997 with a longer period within which to file a review petition, namely, 60 days. This period was cut down, by amendment, with effect from 04.11.2016, to 30 days. From this two things are clear: one, whether in the original or unamended provision, there is no separate power to condone delay, as is contained in Section 20(3) of the Act; and second, that the period of 60 days was considered too long and cut down to 30 days thereby evincing an intention that review petitions, if they are to be filed, should be within a shorter period of limitation - otherwise they would not be maintainable.\n\n2017 ALL SCR 2366 Foll.\t(Paras 6, 9, 10, 12, 14)"

                "description": "Plural remedies - Cause of action - What constitutes - Consequential relief - Meaning of.\n\nTerm \"cause of action\" has been used in two places namely in Section 31 of \"the Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993\" and this rule 10 of the Procedure Rules. But nowhere it is defined either in the Act or Rules. Even the Code of Civil Procedure does not define the said expression.  [Para 9]\n\nIt is not that Rule 10 altogether prohibits joining different and distinct causes of action but condition in that behalf is that, reliefs prayed for, shall be consequential to one another. Thus, if the reliefs are consequential to one another, then, claim based on more than single cause of action can be joined in single application. Words \"reliefs prayed for are consequential to one another\" is not to be confused with the words \"consequential reliefs\". In considering whether Rule 10 of the Procedure Rules applies and whether the suit of the bank is hit by the same, all the averments made by the plaintiff in the plaint should be considered and it would not be proper to go simply by enumaration of transactions.  [Para 11,13]\n\nIn this case in the given loan facility there were certain transactions. First letter dated 12-5-1993 mentions that the defendants were enjoying following limits; (1) Packing Credit Limited Rs. 5 lacs, (2) FDBP/ FUBP Rs. 15 lacs and they have requested for renewal and enhancement of Packing credit Limit and other two facilities. Second letter dated 3-12-1993 also shows that the defendants enjoyed various facilities including FUBP. Thus, it cannot be said that these were independent transactions and without any documents facilities were granted by the bank. It is not that without any letter like Page No. 49 and 51, the defendants just gave foreign bills and the plaintiff-bank purchased the same and thereafter, each bill purchased, was dishonoured, so that it can be said that there were four different transactions. In a facility known as F.U.B.P. (Foreign Usance Bills Purchase), the defendants gave bills to the Plaintiff bank and the plaintiff-bank purchased the same by crediting account of the defendants and when the bills were dishonoured, claim in that facility, is made by the plaintiff-bank to the tune of Rs. 42,70,469/-. The Learned Presiding Officer has lost sight of this fact and simply took these four bills as independent transactions and rested his decision on that basis without considering earlier averments in that behalf. As such, at least this claim of Rs. 42,70,469/- was clearly within the pecuniary jurisdiction of the Debts Recovery Tribunal. Four bills dishonoured constitutes transactions in the facility of foreign usance bills purchased and as such constitutes only one cause of action.  [Para 13]"

(1908), S.51(d), O.21, R.11. Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, R.331.\n\nA suit filed by a Muslim wife for dissolution of marriage, alleging cruelty and neglect : Later the parties arrived at settlement whereunder it was inter alia agreed that the marriage between them be dissolved with immediate effect and that the husband shall pay Rs.2,00,000/- to the wife for maintenance of herself and their two minor daughters.  Accordingly decree for dissolution of marriage was passed.  But the husband did not pay the amount on or before the stipulated date.  One of the clauses of the Consent Terms restrained the husband to sell/encumber his shop till payment was made.\n\nHeld, though there is no provision in the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939, for obtaining divorce by consent of both parties, by not refuting the allegations made by the wife in the Plaint with respect to cruelty and neglect and by filing Consent Terms inter alia for the maintenance of the children, the Defendant husband has sort of submitted to decree and is deemed to have accepted all the allegations made against him and therefore, the decree is actually deemed to have been passed under Section 2(ii) of the Dissolution of Muslim Marriages Act, 1939.  Moreover, the Court cannot and should not show leniency to a father who does not care for the welfare of his children.  The Plaintiffs are decree holders and are entitled for appointment of Receiver, as per Section 51(d) of the Civil P.C., read with Order 21 Rule 11 and Rule 331 of the Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules, 1980.  Necessary directions for appointment of Receiver and sale of shop were accordingly passed.  [Para 7]"

The act sets out that the nomination has to be made during the life time of the holder as per procedure prescribed by law. If that procedure is followed, the nominee would become entitled to all the rights in the shares to the exclusion of all other persons. The nominee would be made beneficial owner thereof. Upon such nomination, therefore, all the rights incidental to ownership would follow. This would include the right to transfer the shares, pledge the shares or hold the shares. The specific statutory provision making the nominee entitled to all the rights in the shares excluding all other persons would show expressly the legislative intent. Once all other persons are excluded and only the nominee becomes entitled under the statutory provision to have all the rights in the shares none other can have it. Further Section 9.11 of the Depositories Act 1996 makes the nominee's position superior to even a testamentary disposition. The non-obstante Clause in Section 9.11.7 gives the nomination the effect of the Testamentary Disposition itself. Hence, any other disposition or nomination under any other law stands subject to the nomination made under the Depositories Act. Section 9.11.7 further shows that the last of the nominations would prevail. This shows the revocable nature of the nomination much like a Testamentary Disposition. A nomination can be cancelled by the holder and another nomination can be made. Such later nomination would be relied upon by the Depository Participant. That would be for conferring of all the rights in the shares to such last nominee.\n\nA reading of Section 109-A of the Companies Act and 9.11 of the Depositories Act makes it abundantly clear that the intent of the nomination is to vest the property in the shares which includes the ownership rights thereunder in the nominee upon nomination validly made as per the procedure prescribed, as has been done in this case. These Sections are completely different from Section 39 of the Insurance Act set out which require a nomination merely for the payment of the amount under the Life Insurance Policy without confirming any ownership rights in the nominee or under Section 30 of the Maharashtra Co-operative Societies Act which allows the Society to transfer the shares of the member which would be valid against any demand made by any other person upon the Society. Hence these provisions are made merely to give a valid discharge to the Insurance Company or the Co-operative Society without vesting the ownership rights in the Insurance Policy or the membership rights in the Society upon such nominee. The express legislature intent under Section 109-A of the Companies Act and Section 9.11 of the Depositories Act is clear.\n\nSince the nomination is shown to be correctly made by her husband who was the holder of the Suit shares, the Plaintiff would have no right to get the shares of her deceased husband sold or to otherwise deal with the same.\t\t\t\t [Para 24,25,26]"

There is no mention in Regulation 206 that the Officer-in-Charge reservists has the power to either remove or dismiss a reservist from service. A plain reading of sub-section (3) of Section 20 of the Army Act on the other hand, would show that an officer having power not less than a brigade or equivalent commander or any prescribed officer may dismiss or remove from the service any person serving under his command other than an officer or a junior commissioned officer. Regulation 206 cannot take away the power vested under the Army Act in the brigade commander to dismiss or remove any person working under him. The High Court rightly held in the impugned judgment that the brigade commander had the power to dismiss the appellant from service.  [Para 7]"

There is absolutely no merit in the submission that there is a discrimination between manufacturers of Homoeopathic and Ayurvedic medicines. Even on the assumption that a similar diversion of alcohol may conceivabley take place in the manufacture of Ayurvedic medicines, the argument of the Petitioner at the highest would be that the classification is under inclusive, but it is well settled that it is not necessary for the legislature to regulate every conceivable activity in order to regulate something. The legislature can recognize and distinguish between degrees of evil and regulate those areas where its intervention is most required. Such a classification cannot be regarded as arbitrary or unconstitutional. The submission that Rule 106-B has been brought into force without complying with mandatory procedural requirements is based on the allegation that the Drugs Technical Advisory Board did not have any representative with an expert knowledge in the field of Homoeopathy. The constitution of the Board is provided for in Section 5(2) of the Act. Hence, it would not be for the Court to mandate any change in the statutory provision relating to the Constitution of the Board. That is for the Parliament to best determine.\n  [Para 7,8,9]"

It is not available to the applicant to raise the defence that under Rule 65 as well as sub-clauses of the said Rule impose the duty on the licensee alone to maintain records and registers in the prescribed forms and for any contravention thereof it is the licensee alone who is responsible for such breach of Rule and is alone liable for prosecution. It must be borne in mind that the legislature thought it fit to prohibit every person whether he is a licensee himself or other person who is acting on behalf of such licensee (in whichever capacity) to sell any drug or cosmetic in contravention of any of the provisions of the Act and Rules made thereunder. Neither section 18 nor section 25 carves out any exception in this regard in favour of person who is acting on behalf of the licensee from the criminal liability. In absence thereof, it is not possible to exclude a person who is acting on behalf of the licensee and the act of such person contravenes the provisions of the Act and Rules, to be excluded from the Criminal liability under the provisions of the Act. The contention of the learned counsel for the applicant if accepted in this regard, would frustrate the scheme of sections 18 and 27 and, therefore, the same is rejected.\n\nThe purport of sections 18 and 27 is every person whether licensee agent or may be a qualified person, is prohibited from selling any drug in contravention of provisions of Act and Rules without any exception to this Rule and, therefore, all those who sell drug in contravention of the provisions of the Act and Rules are responsible for such contravention and can be proceeded against. Any other interpretation of sections 18, and 27, in my view would be totally inconsistent with the legislative intent as well as object and purpose for which these provisions are enacted by the legislature. For the reasons stated hereinabove, the contention canvassed by Shri Manohar, learned Counsel for the applicant in this regard is misconceived and devoid of substance.\t [Para 22,23]"

                "description": "Custody of children - Husband's right to custody of children - Controlling consideration governing custody of children is welfare of children and not rights of parents - Custody of daughter age over 13 years and of elder and younger son - Custody of elder son allowed to continue with father but custody of daughter and youngest son given to the mother who was well placed to look after them.\n\nThe dominant consideration in making orders under S.25 is the welfare of the minor children and in considering this question due regard has of course to be paid to the right of the father to be the guardian and also to all other relevant factors having a bearing on the minor's welfare. There is a presumption that a minor's parents would do their very best to promote their children's welfare and, if necessary, would not grudge any sacrifice of their own personal interest and pleasure. This presumption arises because of the natural, selfless affection normally expected from the parents for their children. From this point of view, in case of conflict or dispute between the mother and the father about the custody of their children, the approach has to be somewhat different from that adopted by the Letters Patent Bench of the High Court in this case. There is no dichotomy between the fitness of the father to be entrusted with the custody of his minor children and considerations of their welfare. The father's fitness has to be considered, determined and weighed predominantly in terms of the welfare of his minor children in the context of all the relevant circumstances. If the custody of the father cannot promote their welfare equally or better than the custody of the mother, then, he cannot claim indefeasible right to their custody under S. 25 merely because there is no defect in his personal character and he has attachment for his children -which every normal parent has. No doubt, the father has been presumed by the statute generally to be better fitted to look after the children - being normally the earning member and head of the family but the Court has in each case to see primarily to the welfare of' the children in determining the question of their custody, in the background of all the relevant facts having bearing on their health, maintenance and education. The family is normal1y the heart of our society and for a balanced and healthy growth of children it is highly desirable that they get their due share of affection and care from both the parents in their normal parental home. Where, however family dissolution due to some unavoidable circumstances becomes necessary the Court has to come to a judicial decision on the question of the welfare of the children on a full consideration of all the relevant circumstances.\t  [Para 14]"

In her view there was a studied unkindness on his part which was reflected in various acts on his part.  Thus for example he did not confide in her in his financial affairs or with respect to family affairs on his parents side.  He did not take her to his parents, nor did he join her to visit her parents.  Whenever the Appellant got an opportunity to go abroad, she requested the Respondent to join her but he turned down that request not less than on three occasions when there was no additional expenditure involved.  On the other hand, he would go to Goa alone.  He did not contribute to expenditure for the matrimonial home beyond a sum of Rs.1000/- or Rs.1500/- per month and the payment of electricity bill, when his earning per month was not less than Rs.8000/-.  All these acts constituted cruelty against her.  She was constrained to leave the matrimonial home and to go to the parents home some time in October, 1998.  Thereafter she filed matrimonial petition first in this Court in September, 1999 though later the same was transferred to the Family Court, where it has came to be numbered as A-1135 of 2000 and decided against her.  After the Appellant filed the above referred petition, it was served on the Respondent but he did not care to attend in Family Court though served.  The Appellant filed an affidavit to substantiate her allegations.  The learned Judge proceeded ex-parte but unfortunately for her did not accept her version of cruelty and dismissed the Petition.  Being aggrieved by the judgment and decree, this Appeal is filed.  The Appellant had made out a case of cruelty before the trial Court and the learned Judge has erred in ignoring the material which was placed before him.  There was no reason for him to come to the conclusion that in fact the Appellant was at fault when the Respondent did not care to contest the petition, and the submissions made by the Appellant on cruelty were cogent and un-controverted.  It was for her to form her impression as to how she was treated.  She has placed it on record and we cannot say that she was unreasonable in contending that she was meted out a cruel treatment over a period of four years in an unsatisfactory married life.  For the reason stated above, she has made out a case under section 10 of the Indian Divorce Act, 1869 as interpreted in Pragati Varghese.  She is therefore, entitled to a decree of divorce.\n\n2002 AIR SCW 162 and 1997(3) Mh.L.J. 602 - Followed.\t\t\t [Para 4,5,11]"

Perhaps, Christian women are never cruel to their husbands, for they are \"Christian\". Assuming there is any discrimination, the discrimination, if at all, would be in favour of a woman, which is perfectly, valid and permissible in view of Article 15(3) of the Constitution.\n\nEven if there is some substance in the grievance that section 10 of the Act as it stands makes a discrimination in the matter of grounds of divorce between a Christian husband and wife, we have no power to introduce into section 10 a ground which the legislation did not contemplate. Section 10 is conveniently divided into two portions. The first, titled, \"When husband may petition for dissolution\", deals with the ground on which a Christian husband may petition for dissolution of marriage. From 1869, till today, the only ground for divorce available for the husband under the Act is the ground of adultery. The second portion of section 10 deals with \"When wife may petition for dissolution\", and contains several grounds, some of which were struck down. Even assuming that the remainder of section 10 after the exercise carried out by the Full Bench is considered to be discriminative against the Christian husband, it is not open to us to read into section 10 any ground other than the ground provided by the Legislature.

No other ground appeared available from Section 10 of the Act, as it stood at the relevant time. Therefore, it conflicting pleadings and evidence of the parties on the question of cruelty are beyond the scope of Section 10 of the Act as it stood then and such a ground was unavailable to the appellant though the petition filed also on the ground of cruelty was decided on merits on that question also by the trial Court.  AIR 2001 Ker 195 - Rel. on.  [Para 9]\n\nThe claim of the first respondent that at any time before filing of this petition for divorce, no unchastity was ever attributed to her by the appellant in any of the complaints of notices or proceedings before the Courts, is not in dispute and if such questionable conduct of the first respondent was known to the appellant since long prior to his filing the petition for divorce on his detecting the letters Exs.A-3 and A-4, it is inexplicable as to why the appellant remained silent till this petition on that aspect. The letters Exs.A-3 and A-4 by themselves are no unambiguous indications of any adulterous conduct on the part of the wife. It is true that in both the letters the second respondent was alleged to have addressed the first respondent as 'Dear Raja Kumari' and requested her to meet him in the manner requested in the letters. But merely because such a request by the second respondent to the first respondent was made to meet him on both the occasions, there cannot be a straight presumption of questionable relationship between both of them.  [Para 10]\n\nThe first respondent specifically denied any acquaintance with the second respondent or receiving any letters from him and though it is true that she attempted to state in the counter and during the cross-examination of PW-1 and in her own evidence about the second respondent being available to be influenced by the appellant for taking a stand against her, that will not suffice to prove any continuous course of conduct of adulterous life between the respondents. The weakness of the version of the first respondent cannot be a ground to accept the case of the appellant and the appellant has to succeed in his case on the strength of his own case, more so, when such a serious allegation of living in adultery was made against the wife through whom he had three children after marital life since 1981 to 1995.  [Para 12]\n\nThe self-serving and uncorroborated claims of the appellant, cannot be considered sufficient to prove the allegation of adultery, apart from the fact that even Exs.A-3 and A-4 may only suggest at the worst occasional lapses in virtue which may not amount to the wife living in adultery. Under the circumstances, the appellant cannot succeed and the absence of any purpose in continuing the marital tie in view of separation of the couple since 1991 and any consequential irretrievable break down of the marriage cannot be valid grounds under the statutory provisions under which the relief is claimed.

All that is required of him is to prove that his wife has since the solemnisation of the marriage been guilty of adultery. Hence, adultery by itself is made a ground for divorce as far as husbands belonging to the Christian community are concerned. Now let us see how the wife is placed vis-a-vis the husband for claiming the very same relief. Provision in this regard is made in the later part of the Section. As far as the ground of adultery is concerned, the same by itself is not sufficient to grant her a divorce. Adultery has to be incestuous adultery. Adultery has to be accompanied with bigamy. Adultery has to be accompanied by marriage with another woman. Adultery has to be coupled with cruelty or with desertion without reasonable excuse and that too for a period of two years or upwards. A question which arises for consideration is, whether there are just and sufficient grounds to make the above classification which places the Christian women to a disadvantageous position as compared to their husbands. Are there any grounds at all which can justify the discrimination. Can the discrimination be justified because the wives belong to the weaker sex. Can it be justified in order to establish the superiority of husbands over the wives. Is it merely in order to ensure that the wife is not treated equally with the husband. The aforesaid discrimination which is meted out to the wife, is wholly unreasonable. Article 14 of the Constitution ensures equality before law. The same mandates that the State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or equal protection of the laws within the territory of India. Is this the equality that the State has been able to offer to Christian wives as per the mandate contained in the above Article. Is this the equal protection of law which the State has envisaged and has conferred on the Christian wives as compared to those conferred on Christian husbands. The answer to these questions can be only one, 'NO'. Hence Section 10 is violative of Arts.14,15 and 21 of the Constitution.  [Para 35]"

The ground of desertion for the purpose of decree for dissolution of marriage is unknown to the divorce Act.  The language of S.10 makes it clear that the husband may present a petition to the District Court or to the High Court for grant of decree for dissolution of marriage on the ground of adultery. No ground other than adultery is provided in Sec. 10 of the Act. From the close scrutiny of the recitals of the marriage petition and the solitary oral testimony of the petitioner husband, it is revealed that the petitioner husband has sought dissolution of marriage on the ground of desertion. There is no ambiguity with regard to the ground for dissolution of marriage. Admittedly, the petitioner husband has filed a divorce petition under sec. 10 of the Divorce Act. The ground of desertion is not at all available to the petitioner husband for the purpose of getting a decree for dissolution of marriage. The only ground available to the petitioner husband is of wife's adultery, that too after solemnization of the marriage. The petitioner husband has not at all asked the relief of dissolution of marriage on the ground of adultery.  [Para 10,11]\n\nSection 10 is not violative of Art.14 of the constitution as held by SC in (1994) 5 SCC 704.  In the circumstances it could be held that the lower court committed illegality and impropriety in reading ground of desertion in S.10. It was impermissible to dissolve marriage by decree of divorce on ground of desertion.  Order of divorce could not be confirmed.  [Para 16,17]"

                "description": "Evidence Act (1872), S.113B - Dowry death - Basic ingredients of offence - Marriage took place on 6-3-1992 - Wife committed suicide on 27-7-1997 by consuming poison - However, there was no evidence to show that there was any cruelty or harassment for or in connection with the demand of dowry - Since prosecution failed to prove cruelty or harassment - Conviction cannot be maintained.\n\nThe basic ingredients to attract the provisions of Section 304-B are as follows :- (1)  The death of a woman should be caused by burns or fatal injury or otherwise than under normal circumstances; (2)  Such death should have occurred within seven years of her marriage; (3)  She must have been subjected to cruelty or harassment by her husband or any relative of her husband; and (4)  Such cruelty or harassment should be for or in connection with demand for dowry.   [Para 11]\n\nIf Section 304-B, IPC is read together with Section 113-B of the Evidence Act, a comprehensive picture emerges that if a married woman dies in an unnatural circumstances at her matrimonial home within 7 years from her marriage and there are allegations of cruelty or harassment upon such married woman for or in connection with demand of dowry by the husband or relatives of the husband, the case would squarely come under \"dowry death\" and there shall be a presumption against the husband and the relatives. In this case there is practically no evidence to show that there was any cruelty or harassment for or in connection with the demand of dowry. There is also no finding in that regard. This deficiency in evidence proves fatal for the prosecution case. Even otherwise mere evidence of cruelty and harassment is not sufficient to bring in application of Section 304-B, IPC. It has to be shown in addition that such cruelty or harassment was for or in connection with the demand for dowry. Since the prosecution failed to prove that aspect the conviction as recorded cannot be maintained. 1996 SCC (Cri) 31 - Rel. on.   [Para 14,15]"

Demand neither conceives nor would conceive of any agreement. If for convicting any offender, agreement for dowry is to be proved, hardly any offenders would come under the clutches of law. When Section 304-B refers to \"demand of dowry\", it refers to the demand of property or valuable security as referred to in the definition of \"dowry\" under the Act. The argument that there is no demand of dowry, in the present case, has no force. In cases of dowry deaths  and suicides, circumstantial evidence plays an important role and inferences can be drawn on the basis of such evidence. That could be either direct or indirect. It is significant that Section 4 of the Act, was also amended by means of Act 63 of 1984, under which it is an offence to demand dowry directly or indirectly from the parents or other relatives or guardian of a bride. The word \"agreement\" referred to in Section 2 has to be inferred on  the facts and circumstances of each case. The interpretation that the respondents seek, that conviction can only be if there is agreement for dowry, is misconceived. This would be contrary to the mandate and object of the Act. \"Dowry\" definition is to be interpreted with the other provisions of the Act including Section 3, which refers to giving or taking dowry and Section 4 which deals with a penalty for demanding dowry, under the Act and the I. P. This makes it clear that even demand of dowry on other ingredients being  satisfied is punishable. It is not always necessary that there be any agreement for dowry.   [Para 8]"

The expressions 'or any time after marriage' and 'in connection with the marriage of the said parties' were introduced by amending Act 63 of 1984 and Act 43 of 1986 with effect from 02.10.1985 and 19.11.1986 respectively. These amendments appear to have been made with the intention to cover all demands at the time, before and even after the marriage so far they were in connection with the marriage of the said parties. This clearly shows the intent of the legislature that these expressions are of wide meaning and scope. The expression 'in connection with the marriage' cannot be given a restricted or a narrower meaning. The expression 'in connection with the marriage' even in common parlance and on its plain language has to be understood generally. The object being that everything, which is offending at any time i.e. at, before or after the marriage, would be covered under this definition, but the demand of dowry has to be 'in connection with the marriage' and not so customary that it would not attract, on the face of it, the provisions of this section.

The expression 'demand for dowry' will have to be construed ejusdem generis to the word immediately preceding this expression. Similarly, 'in connection with the marriage' is an expression which has to be given a wider connotation. It is of some significance that these expressions should be given appropriate meaning to avoid undue harassment or advantage to either of the parties. These are penal provisions but ultimately these are the social legislations, intended to control offences relating to the society as a whole. Dowry is something which existed in our country for a considerable time and the legislature in its wisdom considered it appropriate to enact the law relating to dowry prohibition so as to ensure that any party to the marriage is not harassed or treated with cruelty for satisfaction of demands in consideration and for subsistence of the marriage.

In few cases, guilty are punished but it has no deterrent effect on mothers-in-law or sisters-in-law who might have suffered similar cruelty/tyranny. This deep rooted social evil requires to be controlled not only by effective implementation of the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961, but also by the Society. The Society has to find out ways and means of controlling and combating this menace of receipt and payment of dowry. It appears that instead of controlling payment and receipt of dowry in one or other form, it is increasing even in educated class. May be that it is increasing because of accumulation of unaccounted wealth with few and others having less means follow the same out of compulsion. [Para 1]"

The object of the Bill was to prohibit the evil practice of giving and taking of dowry. This objective was not achieved hence drastic amendments were brought in by amending various provisions of the said Act and the related provisions under the Indian Penal Code and the Evidence Act. Earlier, the definition of 'dowry' which was limited to the time at or before the marriage was extended to the period even after the marriage by means of Act 43 of 1986 w.e.f.  November 19, 1986. Similarly, Section 304-B was introduced by means of the same amending Act and Section 498-A was introduced by Criminal Law (Second Amendment) Act, 1983 (Act 46 of 1983). Various other amendments were brought in bringing more stringent provisions in the aforesaid 1961 Act in order to stem the onslaught on the life of a married woman.  [Para 10]\n\nIt is true that in criminal jurisprudence benefit of doubt is extendable to the accused. But that benefit of doubt would arise in the context of the application of penal law, and in the facts and circumstances of a case. The concept of benefit of doubt has an important role to play but within the confines of the stringency of laws. Since the cause of death to a married woman was to occur not in normal circumstances but as a 'dowry death', for which the evidence was not to (too) easily available, as it is mostly confined to within four walls of a house, namely husband's house where all likely accused reside. Hence the aforesaid amendments brought in the concept of deemed 'dowry death' by the husband or the relatives, as the case may be. This deeming clause has a role to play and cannot be taken lightly and ignored to shield an accused otherwise the very purpose of the amendment will be lost. Of course, the prosecution has to prove the ultimate essential ingredients beyond all reasonable doubt after raising the initial presumption of 'deemed dowry death'.  [Para 11]"

The interpretation that the appellant seeks, that conviction can only be if there is agreement for dowry, is misconceived. This would be contrary to the mandate and object of the Act. \"Dowry\" definition is to be interpreted with the other provisions of the Act including Section 3, which refers to giving or taking dowry and Section 4 - Penalty for demanding dowry, under the 1961 Act and the Indian Penal Code. This makes it clear that even demand of dowry on other ingredients being satisfied is punishable. This leads to the inference, when persistent demands for TV and scooter are made from the bride after marriage or from her parents, it would constitute to be in connection with the marriage and it would be a case of demand of dowry within the meaning of Section 304-B, IPC. It is not always necessary that there be any agreement for dowry.  [Para 16]\n\nIn the present case after few days of the marriage there was demand of scooter and fridge, which when not being met lead to repetitive taunts and maltreatment. Such demands cannot be said to be not in connection with the marriage. Hence the evidence qualifies to be demand for dowry in connection with the marriage and in the circumstances of the case constitutes to be a case falling within the definition of 'dowry' under Section 2 of 1961 Act and Section 304-B, IPC.

On the other hand the positive evidence clearly establishes that payment of money in cash was only as dowry and nothing else. In our considered opinion, even if there is a custom in any community to pay substantial money to the bridegroom either before or at or after the marriage, it would be contrary to the very object for which D.P. Act has been enacted and it defeats the very object which the Act sought to be achieved, such payments are kept outside the definition of 'Dowry' on the premise that it is customary, it would defeat the purpose of the Act, and in all cases the accused could relieve themselves from the rigor of law by describing it as customary.

Once the payment of the full purchase price is made, title in the property would pass to an auction-purchaser.

                "description": "Heritage buildings and heritage precincts - Hoardings on - Lawfulness - Heritage Conservation Committee - Powers and duty of - Municipal Commissioner's power to override - Limited to exceptional cases.\n\nMumbai Municipal Corporation Act (1888), Ss.328, 328A.\n\nIn the instant writ petition by way of public interest litigation, the lawfulness of hoardings on heritage buildings and heritage precincts in Mumbai was challenged.  During pendency of the petition, a batch of writ petitions were filed by hoarding owners and by persons claiming an entitlement to display advertisements and hoardings situated on heritage buildings.  The Court appointed an Expert Committee and after considering its report came to the conclusion that there was no merit in the legal challenges preferred before the Court on behalf of the hoarding owners and advertisers, yet, it was inappropriate for the Court to deal with the facts of each individual case under Article 226 bereft of a decision by the Heritage Conservation Committee.  The Expert Committee appointed by the Court carried out a mammoth exercise.  Nevertheless, having regard to the role and position of the Heritage Conservation Committee, the Court left it to that Committee to consider individual cases after furnishing an opportunity to the advertisers and hoarding owners to submit their representation.  The Heritage Conservation Committee observed in its Report that \"the vast majority of the hoardings have been erected to the detriment and prejudice of the heritage value of such structures, public open spaces and precincts\".  The Committee was of the view that while by and large hoardings should not be permitted at listed heritage buildings and structures and in their compounds or in and around listed public open spaces or within heritage precincts, it should be open to the Committee to permit a display in exceptional cases if certain conditions are satisfied.  The Report of the Committee recommending removal of hoardings from various heritage buildings and precincts was not accepted by the Municipal Commissioner.\n\nHeld, that the action of the Municipal Commissioner in overriding the Report of the Heritage Conservation Committee suffered from the following illegalities -\n\ni)\tThough certain precincts were listed under Regn.67(2) the Development Control Regulations as Heritage precincts, the Municipal Commissioner treated them as not listed. \n\nii)\tRegulation 67(2) mandates that the Commissioner \"shall act on the advice of/in consultation with\" the Heritage Conservation Committee.  The power of the Municipal Commissioner to overrule the decision of the Committee is confined to exceptional cases and for reasons to be recorded in writing.  The power is to be exercised by the Commissioner himself and is not to be delegated to any other officer.  However, in the instant case the Municipal Commissioner had overridden the Heritage Committee without there being any exceptional reasons.  The personal view of the Municipal Commissioner regarding urban aesthetics could not be allowed to transgress the restraints on the exercise of his own administrative powers.  [Para 14]\n\niii)\tThe Heritage Conservation Committee acted intra vires its powers in framing Guidelines for regulation of hoardings and billboards.  In view of the broad sweep of the expression \"development\" under the Act, the regulation of hoardings and billboards does fall within the ambit of Regulation 67.  The provisions of Regulation 67 will be defeated - and with it the salutary public interest in conserving and protecting heritage structures and precincts - if the regulation of hoardings and billboards is to be carved out of Regulation 67.  That cannot be done.  The power to frame guidelines is also expressly conferred upon the Committee by clause 4.9 of its terms of reference.  The decision which has been arrived at by the Municipal Commissioner is patently perverse.  The decision is based on a wrong and incorrect perception of the nature of his powers under Regulation 67(2).  The decision is based on a demonstrably incorrect appreciation of the applicable principles of law embodied in the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966.  [Para 21,24]\n\niv)\tChhatrapati Shivaji Terminus is listed as a grade one heritage structure.  13 hoardings which are on or in the compound of the Terminus are admittedly not of exempted category since they are plainly of commercial nature.  However, the Municipal Commissioner did not give any finding thereon on the ground that they are situated within Railway premises.  Thus the Municipal Commissioner failed to notice the governing statutory provisions and thus failed to discharge statutory obligation imposed upon him.\t\t\t\t\t      [Para 24]\n\nv)\tThe Municipal Commissioner was also not justified in wholly rejecting the recommendations of the Heritage Conservation Committee in relation to hoardings situated in Heritage precincts, hoardings situated in the compound of Grade-II structures and hoardings on all Grade-III structures.  Grade-III structures have been excluded in one fell stroke without an application of mind to the relevant provisions.  The Municipal Commissioner evidently ignores that for Grade-I buildings and precincts \"absolutely essential and minimal changes would be allowed and they must be in accord with the original\".  For Grade-II(A), adaptive reuse or external changes are \"subject to strict scrutiny\".  For Grade-II(B), the need to preserve harmony and the need not to detract from existing heritage buildings and precincts, especially in terms of height and facade is emphasised.  Yet the Commissioner permits all hoardings in the compounds of Grade-II structures, irrespective of height and facade.  Even in the case of Grade-III buildings, the regulation requires that \"unless absolutely essential nothing should spoil or destroy any special features or attributes for which it is placed in the Heritage List\".  None of these vital principles finds mention in the approach of the Municipal Commissioner as elucidated before this Court.  The view taken by the Municipal Commissioner in so far as he differed with the Heritage Conservation Committee is manifestly unsustainable and must, therefore, be quashed and set aside. \t\t\t\t\t         [Para 25,26]"

There may be some other transfers besides instances of transfer stated in sub-section (6) of section 4 and word \"otherwise\" has been used keeping that in mind.

F of Transfer Scheme Rules, it would still have to pay the tax.\n\nThe scheme contemplated by the Delhi Electricity Reforms Act and the Rules framed therein is that the assets of the erstwhile Delhi Vidyut Board initially stood transferred and vested absolutely in the Government. The undertakings were transferred to generation, transmission and distribution companies. The shares of these companies were allotted to the Holding Company which is Delhi Power Company Ltd. which is a wholly owned Government company. Land and land rights also were transferred to the Holding Company. Thereafter the process of privatization takes place by divesting shares in the distribution companies. It is clear that the transfer of all the assets including land to the Government is a transitory step as the Holding Company is to be in total control. In the above background, the question is whether the land belongs to the Government and exempt from tax. No doubt, all the assets of Delhi Vidyut Board stood transferred and vested in the Government. It is also clear that the distribution undertaking with assets mentioned in Items I, II & III of Part I of Schedule F were transferred to the Distribution Company. The proviso to Items I, II & III of Part I of Schedule F to the Transfer Scheme Rules contemplates that land which was exclusively and primarily being used for business purpose by the transferee before the transfer does not form part of the assets transferred and the transferee would be a licnesee of the Government for the said land on payment of a nominal amount. Schedule 'G' deals with transfer in favour of the Holding Company and land and land rights is one of the entities therein. Transfer of assets and liabilities are dealt with in Schedule F and it is clear from the said Schedule that the Distribution Company is a licensee of the Government.further Government continues to be the owner of land and the entry land and land rights is vague and has to be ignored as it is not applicable to the land already covered by Schedule F. Whereas, the case of the Corporation is that there is no ambiguity in Schedule G. Land was transferred to the Holding Company and Section 119 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act is not applicable. The High Court held that the initial transfer and vesting of land is in the Government, then Distribution Company becomes licensee of the Government qua land and finally there is a transfer of land to the Holding Company. In view of the fact that Government was not to hold any asset and the vesting of land in the Government was only transitory in nature, the findings of the High Court that Holding Company is the owner of land is upheld.\n\n\tAccording to Section 120 (1) (c), the person who has a right to let would be liable to pay tax for un-let land. Admittedly, this land is un-let. Incidence of tax has to be decided by the Authority after taking into consideration the provisions of the Act, rules and the licences, including the distribution licence.\n\n\tSection 120 (1) (c) contemplates that a person who has the right to let out un-let land is liable to pay tax. His status as a lessor or licensee is irrelevant. If the distribution licence empowers the Distribution Company to let out the land, notwithstanding the fact that the Distribution Company is a licensee as per Schedule 'F' of the Transfer Scheme Rules, it would still have to pay the tax.\t [Para 12,19]"

The scheme does not contemplate simultaneous consideration of such an application made by a proposed society with an Application subsequently made by another proposed society relating to same land. The Applicant-society has to have 70% support which obviously two societies cannot have. The Application received first is to be processed first independently. If it fails to get 70% support, Second Application can be examined. The obvious intention is to avoid unhealthy competition between the different builders who are interested in supporting such societies. If such a course of simultaneous consideration is permitted to be adopted, unscrupulous persons and builders will try to win over the hutment dwellers who have supported the application made earlier by another society. Therefore, it is not desirable that an application which is earlier made and the one which is subsequently filed should be considered together. That is not the scheme provided under D.C. Regulation 33(10). It is necessary that the application which is first received in respect of a particular property by the SRA should be processed and decided first. After decision of the first Application, the second Application made by another society can be considered depending on the result of the first Application. The reason is that none of the societies have any right, title and interest in respect of the property. Such a course will prevent the unhealthy competition between the builders or between the leaders of two groups in a slum area.  [Para 20]"

The provisions of sections 33 and 38 of the Slum Act have been invoked by the Respondents in order to evict the slum dwellers from the area which is a censused slum.  It is only the machinery which is available under the Slum Act that is being utilised for the purposes of removing the occupants from a land which is declared a slum area.  In fact under the D. C. Regulations steps can be taken to evict those hutment dwellers who do not join a rehabilitation project willingly.  The provisions clearly stipulate that if the hutment dwellers do not join the scheme within 15 days after a slum rehabilitation project has been approved, then action under the provisions of the Slum Act including sections 33 and 38 as amended from time to time can be taken against the hutments.  All those who do not join the project lose the right to any built up tenament and their tenament can be taken over by the slum rehabilitation authority and can be used for accommodating those slum dwellers from other slums who cannot be accommodated in situ.  The Corporation on 24-05-1996 issued a letter of \"no objection\" after verifying the proposal of Respondent No.3 for rehabilitation of the slum area.  After completion of various other formalities the Slum Rehabilitation Authority approved the project on certain terms and conditions.  The impugned orders have been passed after the slum rehabilitation project was approved by the Slum Rehabilitation Authority (SRA).  Factually what has been done is recourse taken to the provisions of sections 33 and 38 of the Slum Act for the purposes of implementing the development plan or project undertaken under D. C. Regulations in relation to a censused area.  That being permissible in law, mere use of machinery provided under the Slum Act cannot be faulted.  Therefore, there is no substance in the contentions of the petitioners that without a notification under section 4 of the Slum Act the provisions of the Act cannot be used at all.  2004(2) ALL MR 320 and 2003(4) ALL MR 584 - Referred to.\t\t\t\t\t  [Para 8]"

If the trustees genuinely wanted to entrust the work of development in whom they and tenants had confidence, nothing stopped them from calling for best offers and then narrowing down the choice. The selection of Raunak Corporation on the basis that it is the best developer is based on an inadequate data.\n\nThe trustees and developers are placing the tenants in the forefront and contending that it is the tenants' desire that they want a 'Maharashtrian' developer. Admittedly the tenants are staying in the dilapidated chawls for years and do not belong to a very rich class. They may or may not have any idea what is the true worth of the property when it is exploited commercially by a developer. The intricate calculation of FSI, TDR and the manner in which they can be commercially exploited are better known to developers. When properties such as the present one, i.e. old dilapidated buildings in the heart of commercial areas consisting of tenants, are put up for alienation, only when competitive bids are invited that all concerned will have a good idea of what is the true worth of the properties and how much corpus will be available. Tenants/occupiers may get tenements of fixed area but competitive bids may push up the corpus and offer several other amenities. Then they may discover that it is the builder of their chosen regionality was in fact cheating them. In the present case the tenants were not exposed to the true worth of the properties in their possession and the monies they would receive. Their decision could not be treated as a well informed one. This decision cannot certainly be advanced as a reason for the trustees and the developers to dispense with public advertisement.\n\nConsidering the totality of the circumstances such as the nature of the property, location, valuation, object of the Act, duties of the trustees, reasons for not giving advertisements, there is no error in directing the Charity Commissioner to call for advertisement from all interested developers. Such course of action cannot be said to be against the interest of the Trust. Such course of action will not only be in the interest of Trust but would dispel all doubts. \t\t\t\t\t\t      [Para 20,27]"

The change in the definition of built up area from merely covered area to areas including basement and service areas will significantly increase the construction area. After all, CRZ clearance is all about construction activity in a coastal zone and, therefore, merely because the construction is open to sky would not make it any less the construction than the construction of the covered area. The Notification dated 4 April 2011 will apply to the pending projects as well, meaning thereby the projects are not already executed. [Para 16]\n\nHowever, when clearances are required only for projects with built up area exceeding 20,000 sq. meters, redevelopment projects for residential buildings should not be unnecessarily delayed even to the extent of construction upto 20,000 sq. meters when the developer is ready to give undertaking not to exceed the construction beyond 20,000 sq. meters without first obtaining environmental clearance. The Authorities take considerable time for taking a decision on the application for environmental clearance or for CRZ clearance. In the meantime the redevelopment projects are being delayed. High Court has been granting relief in such cases on the basis that even if ultimately the authorities were to reject the applications for clearance, there will be no illegality in so far as the developer has made construction upto 20,000 sq. meters.

Further, before development permission is granted the Planning Authority has to consider important issues and matters such as public interest and public safety  including of the neighbourhood. It has to give proper care and due attention to matters such as congestion, affect of the retention/regularization/new construction on the existing facilities and basic amenities including water supply, roads, etc. If the  regularization results in increasing pressure on the existing amenities, then, it would be advisable not to permit such a regularization. The factors enumerated in Regulation 64(b) have to be considered and borne in mind including the contents of the development plan of the City/Town, while granting or refusing permission for regularization of unauthorized construction. By their very nature, the factors in this Regulation are illustrative. The plan is a wider concept and exhaustive. Therein, all aspects are outlined. Merely because the builder and developer states that he will be able to generate TDR and load it on to the existing plot/ construction, that by itself is not decisive. By such process, all constructions, which are unauthorized and illegal, can be regularized. The result would be that every such person would openly flout the building bye-laws and Regulations and make construction without any adherence thereto and later on, he would apply for retention or regularization by urging that the FSI of some other plot belonging to him can be generated and taken into account  for regularization of the subject unauthorized construction. In other words, Developers and Builders would make unauthorized and  illegal construction on plot 'A' and would urge that they are making construction also on the plot 'B', which is in the vicinity. They would bring in the FSI/TDR generated on plot 'B' and load it on plot 'A' and that would enable regularization of the unauthorized and  illegal construction of plot 'A'. If such a course is permitted, there shall be increased pressure on the infrastructure and basic amenities available in or around plot 'A' and particularly its neighbourhood.  That would make the areas in or around plot 'A' crowdy. Sometimes constructions are made in narrow lanes and byelanes. The existing roads and lanes are insufficient to meet the increasing traffic. If unauthorized construction is retained and regularized that would mean additional burden on the already inadequate infrastructural facilities. This would endanger the safety and health of the persons in the building on plot 'A' and also in its neighbourhood. That is certainly not the intention of the Legislature nor does it further the purpose and object of the DC Regulations or Building Rules/Bye-laws."

                "description": "Regularization of unauthorized construction - Municipal and Town Planning authorities cannot adopt an attitude by which they further the interest and cause of developers and wrong-doers at the cost of the township as a whole - They must bear in mind the fact that essential and basic amenities like water and electricity are scarce.\n\nThe Municipal and Town Planning authorities cannot adopt an attitude by which they further the interest and cause of developers and wrongdoers at the cost of the township as a whole. They must bear in mind the fact that essential  and basic amenities like water and electricity are scarce. The pressure on land is immense. It is not possible to construct bridges, roads all the time. Ultimately, a city or town is planned for a certain  number of people and population. The infrastructure and basic  amenities are provided considering the existing population and growth at a projected rate over a passage of time. If there is  increasing pressure and burden on the existing facilities and amenities, then, the whole system would collapse resulting in large scale inconvenience. In every city or town certain number of schools, educational institutions, hospitals, public conveniences etc. are provided on the basis of population figures and by future projection.  These matters must therefore have a bearing, when an application  for retention is made and it is not possible to hold that the authorities should allow such applications only because the Builder/Developer manages to generate FSI in the form of TDR or  otherwise. Similarly, the argument that these constructions be regularized by imposing fine and charging high fees as a matter of  course is also difficult to accept, for the aforementioned reasons. If by imposition of fine and charging of compounding fees, large scale unauthorized constructions are regularized, then, that would  encourage the Builders and Developers so also others having interest in the development activities, to violate laws openly. They will  always proceed on the basis that the building regulations can be breached with impunity and all that they would be visited with, is  high compounding fees. That is not the intention of the Legislature. The penal provisions in Sections 52 and 53 of the MRTP Act, 1966, are enacted with a defined object and purpose. It is to discourage unauthorized and illegal development and also punish the wrong doers. In addition to punishment of wrong doers and offenders, the Legislature empowers the Planning Authority to pull down, remove or alter the unauthorized development or works. Therefore, there is a twin object and purpose in such provisions. That is to check and control unauthorized construction and development and at the same time penalise all those who are responsible for the same. Therefore, by merely charging compounding fees and imposing heavy fines such construction cannot be regularized. Ultimately, the exercise of this discretionary power must not result in a licence to break planning laws. Individual's interest in a property, his right to enjoy it is subject to larger public good and purpose. That right has to be balanced with the requirements of the society. It is not absolute.While dealing with request of retention and regularization, the deviation and deficiencies, the extent of irregularities, the damage and ill effects thereof and the conduct of the parties, are all relevant considerations. What can be termed as a minor deviation or departure in a given case, may still have adverse affects and consequences on the overall development and planning of the city and town. Once the population is increasing, then what is a minor deviation and what could be termed to be a major infraction or breach or violation of the planning laws, are matters which must be decided by the Planning Authorities in the facts and circumstances of each case bearing in mind the above objects and purpose. They cannot as a matter of rule regularize unauthorized constructions by allowing the Builder/Developer/wrong doer to compensate for the violation in terms of money or by permitting him to load TDR/FSI from adjoining plots and areas. If we lay down such a general rule, we would be going contrary to the judicial pronouncements in the field. That would be violating the law of the land.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 123]"

The scheme of Regulation 51 is that one clinic is permitted either on the ground floor or first floor of a building by Regulation 51(ii). The distinguishing features are (a) clinic can be only on the ground or first floor and (b) only one clinic in one building. It is clear that if the submission of the Corporation about the meaning of the word 'building' is accepted, then this clause becomes meaningless. Regulation 51(iii) permits clinics in independent parts of buildings on the ground floor, floor 1 and floor 2 having independent means of access. The distinguishing features of this clause are noted above. Regulation 51(iv) permits any number of residential flats being used for professional purpose by the occupants of the flats provided the area to be used for occupational purpose does not exceed 30 sq.m. The principal purpose of Regulation 51(iii) appears to be that permitting opening of not more than one clinic in a building on ground, first and second floors should not result in burdening the common access which is available to all the occupants of and visitors to the building. Reading Clauses (ii), (iii) and (iv) of Regulation 51 together, it becomes clear that distinguishing features of Clause (iii) are (a) clinic can be permitted upto second floor; (b) the premises must be an independent part of the building and (c) the premises must have a separate means of access/staircase. The idea behind Regulation 51(iii) appears to be that a person who wants to approach the surgical clinic or nursing home, which is to be permitted under Clause 51(iii), should not be required to use the common access available to other occupants of and visitors to the building. The words 'separate means of access' have been used to indicate that there must be a separate approach to the independent part of the building where the clinic can be permitted within the building.

                ],
                "description": "Redevelopment of large plot belonging to corporation - Decision of corporation permitting redevelopment on entire large plot by developer appointed by tenants/occupants without its sub-division or as permissible under Regn.33(9) - Would amount to distributing Govt. largesse without justification.\n\nWhere the plot could be easily subdivided and the developer appointed by the tenants/occupants could be permitted to redevelop the subdivided plot under D.C.R. 33(7), the decision of the Corporation in permitting the redevelopment of the entire plot under D.C.R. 33(7) by the developer appointed by the tenants/occupants would amount to distributing Government largesse without any justification. In the present case, the plot in question admeasures 12130.07 sq. mtrs. The developer appointed by the municipal tenants had put up proposal for sub-division of the plot in question and had sought permission to redevelop the subdivided plot admeasuring 4905.17 sq. mtrs. under D.C.R. 33(7). The Dy. Chief Engineer (BP) on scrutiny of the proposal had recommended redevelopment by subdividing the plot in question. Accordingly, N.O.C. was granted to the developer appointed by the municipal tenants to redevelop the notionally subdivided plot. There is no material on record to suggest that the technical committee had found any fault with the recommendation of the Dy. Chief Engineer (BP). Therefore, in the absence of any legal impediment for sub-division of the plot in question, the decision of the Corporation to allow the developer appointed by the municipal tenants to redevelop the entire plot admeasuring 12130.07 sq. mtrs. with 2.5 FSI instead of the subdivided plot admeasuring 4905.17 sq. mtrs. with 2.5 FSI amounts to conferring relief to the municipal tenants/occupants in excess of what is contemplated under D.C.R. 33(7). The only explanation given by the Corporation for not developing the plot under D.C.R. 33(9) is that the plot in question falls within the height restrictions set out in D.C.R. 31(4)(a). This explanation is a false excuse given by the Corporation which is wholly unsustainable, because, firstly, the Corporation could have applied for relaxation of the height restriction which is permissible under D.C.R. 1991 and secondly, there is evidence on record to show that in the same locality and in fact on the adjoining plot several towers have been constructed by the developers by obtaining relaxation of the height restriction from the Urban Development (Department) which is not disputed. The decision of the Corporation in not permitting redevelopment by subdividing the plot in question as also the decision not to redevelop the plot under D.C.R. 33(9) by inviting tenders but to permit the developer appointed by the tenants/occupants under D.C.R. 33(7) cannot be said to be bonafide decision taken in public interest or in the interest of the Corporation. In the present case, the decision of the Corporation in not permitting redevelopment by subdividing the plot or not redeveloping the plot under D.C.R. 33(9) is without any justiciable basis. It is apparent that the impugned decision has been taken solely with a view to favour the developer appointed by the tenants/occupants in redeveloping the entire plot under D.C.R. 33(7). Even the quantum of premium on the surplus FSI has been fixed arbitrarily without ascertaining the market value of the saleable FSI. This is established by the petitioners by offering to redevelop the plot in question on the same terms and paying to the Corporation premium on the surplus FSI at Rs.130 crores instead of Rs.96.60 crores fixed by the Corporation. Thus, the decision of the Corporation being wholly arbitrary, unreasonable and contrary to public interest, the same is liable to be quashed and set aside.  \t\t [Para 40,41,43,47,48]"

                "description": "Expression \"in consultation with the universities or other bodies concerned\" - \"Other bodies\" does not include State Disaster Management Authority or health experts - UGC is not obliged to consult all Universities or States before issuance of guidelines which is general in nature. \n\nThe expression \u2018other bodies\u2019 used in the opening part of the Section is in reference to other bodies apart from universities enumerated in Section 12. The submission that \u2018other bodies\u2019 as used in Section 12 should include State Disaster Management Authority or health experts is misconceived. Section 12 never contemplated any such \u201cbodies\u201d. Furthermore, the State Disaster Management Authority came into existence only after enactment of Disaster Management Act, 2005, no such concept was there when the UGC Act, 1956 was enacted. The expression \u2018other bodies\u2019 cannot be expanded as contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner. The use of the word \u2018concerned\u2019 after \u2018Universities or other bodies\u2019 has specific purpose and meaning. The consultation with the Universities or other bodies concerned was in reference to a particular function which was enumerated in clause (a) to (j) and it has specific reference and \u201cUniversities\u201d or other bodies\u201d were referred to in the above context. Section 12 cannot be interpreted in a manner that for taking any measure with regard to coordination of university education and for determination and maintenance of standards of teaching examination in the Universities, the UGC should consult each and every University of each and every State and only then, such measures can be taken. Reading the provision in above manner shall make the functioning of UGC unworkable. There are more than nine hundred Universities in the country and to require UGC to consult more than nine hundred universities for taking any measure will make the functioning impossible and impractical.\n\nSection 12 cannot be interpreted in a manner that for taking any steps by the UGC, there is a mandatory requirement of consultation of all the States/Universities failing which no measures can be taken by the University Grants Commission. Clause (j) of Section 12 is couched in a very vide manner which empower the commission to perform such other functions as may be prescribed or as may be deemed necessary by the Commission for advancing the cause of higher education in India or as may be incidental or conducive to the discharge of the above function. Any function which may be deemed necessary by the Commission can be performed. For performance of its function by the Commission, the Commission of its own is fully competent to take decisions, issue any directions, guidelines, etc. The Commission may also take assistance of any Committee of experts in discharge of its functions for which there is no prohibition in the statutory scheme.(Paras 86, 87, 88, 110)\n\nThe expression \u201cin consultation with the Universities or other bodies concerned\u201d has to be read to mean where consultation with Universities or other bodies concerned is necessary without which the Commission is unable to perform its functions. \n\nWhether for collecting information relating to University education in India, UGC has to consult all 900 or more Universities and whether without consultation with the Universities, it cannot perform its functions under Section 12(h), the answer would be obviously that it is not necessary for UGC to consult all the universities while collecting information relating to University Education in India. The expression \u201cUniversities or other bodies concerned\u201d has not be read in a rigid manner rather it is flexible as per requirement of the Commission. The residuary clause i.e. Section 12(j) cloth the Commission to perform such other functions as may be deemed necessary by the Commission. The guidelines dated 29.04.2020 and 06.07.2020 have been issued after consultation of an expert Committee. The guidelines have been issued after a report of an expert committee consisting of academicians and experts. It cannot be said that the Commission had no jurisdiction to issue guidelines without consulting all the Universities in the Country and all the States or Union Territories.(Paras 90, 92)\n\nThe UGC is empowered to perform such other functions as may be deemed necessary by the Commission. If the Commission felt it necessary to issue guidelines after obtaining a report from the expert committee, no exception can be taken to the procedure adopted by the Commission. The guidelines dated 29.04.2020 as well as revised guidelines dated 06.07.2020 are general in nature and not confined to any particular university or any particular state. Hence, it cannot be said that UGC is obliged to consult all Universities or States before issuance of the guidelines.(Para 93)"

When the State Disaster Management Authority and State Government take a decision that for mitigation or prevention of disaster it is not possible to hold physical examination in the State, the said decision was within the four corners of Disaster Management Act, 2005. However, the decision of the Disaster Management Authority or the State Government that students should be promoted without appearing in the final year/terminal semester examination, is not within the domain of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The decision to promote students and grant Degree by a State if contrary to any Central enactment or guidelines issued thereunder the Central enactment and the guidelines thereunder shall have precedence by virtue of the same being referable to Entry 66 List I. Thus, Court conclude that the State Disaster Management Authority and the State Government has no jurisdiction to take a decision that the students of final year/terminal examination should be promoted on the basis of earlier years assessment and internal assessment whereas the UGC guidelines dated 06.07.2020 directed specifically to conduct final year/terminal semester examination. The UGC guidelines dated 06.07.2020 in the above respect shall override the decision of the State Government and the State Disaster Management Authority regarding promoting the students, does not fall within the jurisdiction of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and shall have no protection of Section 72 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. We, thus, conclude that the State or the State Disaster Management Authority have no jurisdiction under Disaster Management Act, 2005 to take a decision for promoting the students on the basis of previous performance or internal assessment which decision being contrary to revised guidelines of the University Grants Commission cannot be upheld and has to give way to the guidelines of UGC which is the Authority to issue guidelines for determination and maintenance of standards of education and teaching of the Universities.(Paras 109, 110, 111)\n\nIf any State/Union Territory in exercise of jurisdiction under Disaster Management Act, 2005 has taken a decision that it is not possible to conduct the final year/terminal semester examination by 30.09.2020, the liberty granted to such State/Union Territory to make an application to the University Grants Commission for extending deadline of 30.09.2020 for that State/Union Territory which shall be considered by UGC and rescheduled date be communicated to such State/Union Territory at the earliest.(Para 111)"

Then what is somewhat intended by the legislature while providing minimum standards of relief is to be gathered from S.12 itself. Ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life as also assistance on account of damage to houses and for restoration of means of livelihood therefore can be said to be part of minimum standards of relief of which the National Authority is required to recommend guidelines. (Para 10)\n\nTherefore, to construe the word \u201cshall\u201d as \u201cmay\u201d and as directory/ discretionary, the very object and purpose of the Act will be defeated. The word \u201cshall\u201d used twice in S.12 significantly imposes a duty cast upon the National Authority to issue guidelines for the minimum standards of relief which shall include ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life as also assistance on account of damage to houses and for restoration of means of livelihood. Nothing is on record that any guidelines/decision has been taken by the National Authority recommending guidelines for the minimum standards of relief in the form of ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life of a person who has died due to Covid-19.\n\nOnce the Covid-19 pandemic is declared as \u201cnotified disaster\u201d/national disaster, even otherwise the same can be disaster within the meaning of S.2(d) of DMA 2005, the provisions of S.12 shall be applicable and it has to be applied to the Covid-19 pandemic which is declared as \u201cnotified disaster\u201d/national disaster. The submission on behalf of the Union of India that considering the peculiar nature of the Covid-19 pandemic, even if Covid-19 pandemic is declared and/or considered as a disaster, S.12 may not be applicable and/or the word \u201cshall\u201d should be construed as \u201cmay\u201d as when DMA 2005 was enacted, the legislature might not have visualised that such a pandemic/disaster would occur which would have a long-time effect/impact. The aforesaid cannot be accepted for the simple reason that every disaster as defined under S.2(d) Act is a disaster and once it is declared as a \u201cnotified disaster\u201d/national disaster/ disaster, S.12 shall be applicable and is mandatorily to be complied with, with respect to any disaster, within the meaning of Section 2(d). Once, it is held that the word \u201cshall\u201d have to be read as \u201cshall\u201d and it is the mandatory statutory duty cast upon the National Authority to recommend guidelines for the minimum standards of relief which shall include ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life, not recommending any Guidelines for ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life due to Covid-19 pandemic, while recommending other guidelines for the minimum standards of relief, it can be said that the National Authority has failed to perform its statutory duty cast under S.12 and therefore a writ of mandamus is to be issued to the National Authority to recommend appropriate guidelines for ex gratia assistance on account of loss of life due to Covid-19 pandemic while recommending guidelines for the minimum standards of relief to be provided to persons affected by disaster/Covid-19 pandemic as mandatory under S.12.\n\nHowever, what reasonable amount to be offered towards ex gratia assistance is left to the wisdom of National Authority which may consider determining the amount taking into consideration the observations made in this decision, such as, requirement/ availability of the fund under the NDRF/ SDRF for other reliefs and the priorities determined by the National Authority/Union Govt and the fund required for other minimum standards of relief and fund required for prevention, preparedness, mitigation and recovery and other reliefs to carry out the obligation under DMA2005. The aforesaid exercise and appropriate guidelines be recommended, within a period of six weeks. (Paras 10, 16)"

Section 59 of the Act deals with the power of confiscation of Deputy Commissioner in certain cases. Section 59(1) thereof provides that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law where anything liable for confiscation under Section 58 is seized or detained, the officer seizing and detaining such thing shall produce the same before the Deputy Commissioner. On production of the seized property, the Deputy Commissioner, if satisfied that the offence under the Act has been committed, may order confiscation of such property. Therefore, under the scheme of the Act any vehicle used for carrying the intoxicant is liable to be confiscated and on seizure of the vehicle transporting the intoxicant, the same is required to be produced before the Deputy Commissioner, who in turn has been conferred with the power of its confiscation.\n\nIn the present case it is evident that the vehicle seized has to be produced before the Deputy Commissioner, who in turn has been conferred with the power of its confiscation or release to its rightful owner. The requirement of production of seized property before the Deputy Commissioner under Section 59(1) of the Act is, notwithstanding anything contained in any other law, and, so also is the power of confiscation. Not only this, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other law for the time being in force, no court, in terms of Section 61 of the Act, has jurisdiction to make any order with regard to the property used in commission of any offence under the Act. In the present case, the Legislature has used a non-obstante clause not only in Section 59 but also in Section 61 of the Act. As is well settled, a non-obstante clause is a legislative device to give effect to the enacting part of the section in case of conflict over the provisions mentioned in the non-obstante clause. Hence, Section 451, 452 and 457 of the Code must yield to the provisions of the Act and there is no escape from the conclusion that the Magistrate or for that matter the High Court, while dealing with the case of seizure of vehicle under the Act, has any power to pass an order dealing with the interim custody of the vehicle on security or its release thereof. Thus the High Court exceeded in its jurisdiction in directing for release of the vehicle on security. \t\t\t  [Para 8,11,14]"

                "description": "Relative scope of S.438 and R.184 - They supplement each other - There is no inconsistency between them - S.438 is an extra-ordinary measure and before passing order Court should hear prosecution.\n\nThe law under S.438, Cr.P.C. and under R.184 of Internal Security Rules and be summarised thus :-\n\n(1) that Section 438 of the Code has not been repealed or overruled by Rule 184 of the Rules but the two have to be read harmoniously without interfering with the spheres contemplated by each of those provisions. In fact Rule 184 of the Rules is only supplemental to Section 438 of the Code and contains the guidelines which have to be followed by the Court in passing order for anticipatory bail in relation to cases covered by Rule 184 of the Rules;\n\n(2) that there is no real inconsistency between Section 438 of the Code and Rule 184 of the Rules;\n\n(3) that Section 438 of the Code is an extraordinary remedy and should be resorted to only in special cases. It would be desirable if the Court before passing an order under Section 438 of the Code issues notice to the prosecution to get a clear picture of the entire situation; and\n\n(4) that in cases covered by Rule 184 of the Rules the Court exercising power under Section 436 or Section 438 of the Code has got to comply with the conditions mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) of Rule 184 and only after the Court has complied with those conditions that an order under any of these sections of the Code in respect of such offences could be passed.  [Para 25]\n\nThere does not appear to be any direct conflict between the provisions of Rule 184 of the Rules and Section 438 of the Code. However, we hold that the conditions required by Rule 184 of the Rules must be impliedly imported in Section 438 of the Code so as to form the main guidelines which have to be followed while the Court exercises its power under Section 438 of the Code in offences contemplated by Rule 184 of the Rules. Such an interpretation would meet the ends of justice, avoid all possible anomalies and would at the same time ensure and protect the liberty of the subject which appears to be the real intention of the Legislature in enshrining Section 438 as a new provision for the first time in the Code. We think that there is no real inconsistency between Section 438 of the Code and Rule 184 of the Rules and, therefore, the non obstante clause cannot be interpreted in a manner so as to repeal or override the provisions of Section 438 of the Code in respect of cases where Rule 184 of the Rules applies.  [Para 16]\n\nSection 438 does not contain unguided or uncanalised powers to pass an order for anticipatory bail, but such an order being of an exceptional type can only be passed if, apart from the conditions mentioned in Section 437, there is a special case made out for passing the order. The words \"for a direction under this section\" and \"Court may, if it thinks fit, direct\" clearly show that the Court has to be guided by a large number of considerations including those mentioned in Section 437 of the Code. When a Court is dealing with offences contemplated by Rule 184 of the Rules, then it is obvious that though the offences are not punishable with death or imprisonment for life so as to attract the provisions of Section 437, the conditions laid down by Rule 184 of the Rules would have to be complied with before an order under Section 438 of the Code could be passed. In other words, the words \"for a direction under this section\" and \"Court may, if it thinks fit, direct\" would impliedly contain a statutory mandate to the Court in the shape of conditions mentioned in clauses (a) and (b) of Rule 184 of the Rules, viz., (1) that an opportunity would be given to the prosecution to oppose the application for anticipatory bail; and (2) the Court must be satisfied that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty of the contravention of the Rules. While giving finding on this the Court will have to take into consideration that under the provisions of the Rules once contravention is alleged the onus lies on the accused to prove that there has been no such contravention. If we construe the two provisions in this manner, then there would be really no inconsistency between Section 438 of the Code and Rule 184 of the Rules and both the provisions can co-exist without coming into conflict with each other. Furthermore, Rule 184 would apply the moment the accused person is taken in custody and as an order passed under Section 438 of the Code cannot be effective until the person is taken in custody. It is therefore obvious that the conditions mentioned in Rule 184 clauses (a) and (b) start applying the moment the accused is taken in custody and if an order under Section 438 of the Code has been passed in his favour he would be released at once.

The contention of the petitioner/s is that the said Resolution is an obligation incurred by the MDLB which the respondent-M.P.T. is bound to follow. This contention is misplaced. The Act does not define the expression obligation which appears in Clause(b) of sub-sec.(1) of Section 4 of the Act. The expression \"obligation\" as per Black's Law Dictionary is a generic word derived from the latin substantive \"obligation\" having many wide and varied meanings, according to the context in which it is used. That which a person is bound to do or forbear; any duty imposed by law, promise, contract, relations of society, courtesy kindness etc. Law or duty binding parties to perform their agreement.  An undertaking to perform. That which constitutes a legal or moral duty and which renders a person liable to coercion and punishment for neglecting it, etc. Obligation is understood as a legal tie, which imposes upon a determinate person or persons, the necessity of doing, or abstaining from doing, a definite act or acts. The said Resolution No.1395 was passed by the MDLB probably on account of persistent efforts made either on behalf of the petitioner/s or their Union and was taken by the MDLB as an administrative or policy decision. There was no contract either between the Union or the petitioner/s.  There was no agreement or contract between the petitioner/s and the MDLB when the latter passed the said Resolution so as to give compassionate appointments to the dependants of the gangworkers who were declared surplus. It is to be noted that the said Resolution was also subject to fulfilment of required conditions of the Recruitment Rules and certainly it cannot be disputed on behalf of the petitioner/s that those of them who satisfied the required conditions were selected and have already been appointed. The said Resolution cannot be construed as an obligation which the MDLB incurred and was required to perform as an obligation. It was merely an administrative or policy decision taken by the MDLB to the effect that the dependants of those who were declared as surplus would be employed subject to fulfilment of required conditions of the Recruitment Rules. Such a Resolution created no obligation in favour of the petitioner/s to be performed by the MDLB.  The respondent-M.P.T. as successor to MDLB was bound to change it and it has been rightly changed by the respondent-MDLB as stated in para 12 of the reply filed regarding which no dispute has been raised by the petitioner/s nor a challenge laid to the decision of the Chairman of M.P.T. not to follow the same being contrary to the scheme of compassionate appointment issued by the Central Government as per Order dated 9-10-1998. No one can have a vested right in a policy decision which can be changed at any time with the change in the policy of the Government or a statutory organisation.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 13]"

Amalgamation of the two plots has been sanctioned. Since the project is being treated as a composite project of redevelopment, the total number of occupants involved is 105, comprised of 88 occupants of CS 1102 and 17 occupants of CS 1101. None of the occupants of CS 1102 has made any complaint and, as a matter of fact, all of them have shifted out of their erstwhile tenements so as to facilitate the process of redevelopment. Similarly,7 of the 17 occupants of CS 1101 have also shifted out. Therefore, even if all the 10 Petitioners were to be treated as persons who have not consented to the scheme for redevelopment that would not make any difference to the computation of the figure of seventy percent. Besides, senior counsel appearing on behalf of the developer points out that not all the 10 Petitioners were eligible occupants. In a judgment of a Single Judge of the Court (Smt. Ranjana Desai,J.) in Fathima Michael Pillai vs. Rajendra Rameshchandra Chaturvedi & anr. 1998(6) LJ 1001, the Court held that where three plots had been amalgamated the consent of seventy percent of all the tenants put together would have to be taken into consideration in order to satisfy the requirement of Section 95A(2) of the MHADA Act, 1976. Counsel for the Petitioners submits that for the purpose of DCR 33(7) each building must be considered separately and the consents of seventy percent of the occupants of every building must be taken separately. The submission cannot be accepted. Once there is an amalgamation of two properties, as in this case, a composite scheme of redevelopment is envisaged. Seventy percent of the tenants/occupants taken in the scheme as a whole must indicate their consents. The scheme is to enure to the benefit of the entire body of them. To require consents to be obtained individually for each building in a composite scheme will defeat the purpose of the scheme, besides being tardy. This will virtually amount to a veto being conferred on a small group of occupants to obstruct the scheme though the large body of them in excess of seventy percent has agreed. The island city of Mumbai has numerous congested areas where it is desirable in the interests of urban planning to execute composite redevelopment of adjoining properties. Where this is sought to be achieved, the requirement of seventy percent must apply to the occupants taken as a whole. \n\n1988 (6) LJ 1001 - Ref. to.   [Para 5]"

                "description": "Transferable Development Rights (TDR) - Definition and meaning of.\n\nTDR is an acronym for Transferable Development Rights.  The expression \"Floor Space Index\" is defined by Development Control Regulation 2(42) to mean the quotient of the ratio of the combined gross floor area of all floors to the total plot area. The definition of the expression \"development right\" therefore, includes transferable development rights in the form of the right to utilize the floor space index of land. This floor space index in the form of TDR is utilizable either on the remainder of the land partially reserved for public purposes or elsewhere as may be provided in the Development Control Regulations. The definitions contained in an Act passed by the legislature, it is trite law, provide a statutory dictionary. TDR is a form of FSI. The Development Control Regulations for Greater Bombay of 1991 elucidate the concept of Transferable Development Rights in Regulation 34. Appendix VII provides regulations for the grant of transferable development rights to owners/developers and the conditions for the grant of such rights. Under clause (1), the owner or lessee of a plot of land which is reserved for a public purpose in the Development Plan is eligible for the award of transferable development rights in the form of FSI to the extent and on the conditions set out in the appendix. Such an award entitles the owner of the land to FSI in the form of a development rights certificate which the owner may use himself or transfer to any other person. The FSI of the receiving plot is allowed to be exceeded to the extent permissible under the regulation by the use of TDR. Conceptually, as a matter of first principle, transferable development rights constitute a legislative recognition of the principle by which the development potential of the land is separated from the land and is made available in the form of a development rights certificate. The genesis of TDR is that lands which were reserved for public purposes including recreation grounds and roads were found to have been encroached upon. The doctrine of TDR was introduced as a matter of legislative policy in order to ensure that upon the public amenities being developed, TDR would be provided in the form of a development rights certificate. This TDR could be utilized in the manner and to be extent contemplated in the Development Control Regulations.  [Para 8]"

                "description": "Power of Municipal Corporation to charge fee as Licensing Authority u/s.479 - Not referable to power of Municipal Corporation as Planning Authority under MRTP Act and DCR - Both the legislations are different in their scope and purpose - If Municipal Corporation is vested with powers to charge fee under M.M.C. Act it does not result in holding that said Corporation is automatically empowered to charge premium/fee under MRTP Act or the DCR framed thereunder.\n\nThe power to charge fee under the M.M.C. Act as a licencing Authority is different than the power to charge premium by the Planning Authority under M.R.T.P. Act. It may be that authority under the M.M.C. Act, may also happen to be the Development Authority under the M.R.T.P. Act. The scope and purpose of two Acts however, is different. Though both the legislations are State legislations, there is no incorporation of the provisos of the M.M.C. Act into the M.R.T.P. Act and vice versa and on the contrary section 124(L) (2) of M.R.T.P. Act makes it clear that subject to the provisions of sub-section (1) which states that the provisions of the chapter shall have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in this Act or any other law for the time being in force, the provisions of Chapter 6A shall be in addition to and not in derogation of any of the provisions of that Act or any law relating to Municipal Corporation, Municipal Council or any local authority of any urban area. Thus the M.R.T.P. Act itself makes it clear that the provisions of M.R.T.P. Act in the matter of development charges will have to be read in conjunction with the B.M.C. Act. Further as noted earlier, there is no incorporation or incorporation by reference and on the contrary, fees/charges payable under the two Acts are independent of each other.  [Para 10]\n\nUnder Section 479(2) of Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act for the licence to be granted, a fee has to be charged at such rate as may be fixed by the Commissioner with sanction of the Corporation. Therefore, it is fee in respect of the licence to be issued under the M.M.C. Act and not under the provisions of M.R.T.P. Act. Merely because the Local Authority which is Planning Authority is also an authority under the M.M.C. Act does not result in holding that the authorities under the M.M.C. Act are conferred with the powers to levy fees under the M.R.T.P. Act. When an Act confers power and provides the manner of exercise of such power, then that exercise must be done in conformity with those provisions. For issuing licences under the provisions of M.M.C. Act, rules have been made for charging fees, and it is those fees alone which would be payable under the M.M.C. Act, irrespective of the provisions of the M.R.T.P. Act. No rules at least have been shown to us under the M.M.C. Act which enables Municipal Commissioner to charge fees while granting special permission under Regulation 35(2)(c) of the D.C. Regulations under M.R.T.P. Act. In our opinion, therefore, it is not possible to accept the contention as urged on behalf of the Respondents that the power to charge fee is referable to the provisions of section 479 of the M.M.C. Act. That contention must be rejected.  [Para 16]"

Defence of India Act (1971), Ss.30, 31; Requisition and Acquisition of Immovable Property Act (1952), S.8(3); Interest Act (1839), S.1; Proviso Interest Act (1978), S.4(1); Land Acquisition Act (1894), Ss.23(2), 23/24.\n\nWhen a property is acquired, and law provides for payment of compensation to be determined in the manner specified, ordinarily compensation shall have to be paid at the time of taking possession in pursuance of acquisition. By applying equitable principles, Courts have always awarded interest on the delayed payment of compensation in regard to acquisition of any property. When a requisitioned property is acquired, as possession had already been taken from the landholder, the compensation becomes payable from the date of acquisition. When a property is requisitioned, the land owner is compensated for the denial of possession by paying compensation based on the rent it would have fetched had it not been requisitioned. But once the property is acquired, the rent is stopped, as compensation based on open market value becomes payable against acquisition. Therefore while interest is payable, it is not awarded from the date of requisition (taking over of possession) but only from the date of acquisition. This principle has been recognized and applied by Courts consistently. Whenever the Arbitrator or High Court increases the compensation for the acquired land, the increase relates back to the date of acquisition as they are merely doing what the Special Land Acquisition Officer ought to have done in the first instance. Therefore, interest is awardable on the increased amount also from the date of acquisition. The said general principle will not apply in two circumstances. One is where a statute specifies or regulates the interest. In that event, interest will be payable in terms of the provisions of the statute. The second is where a statute or contract dealing with the acquisition specifically bars or prohibits payment of interest on the compensation amount. In that event, interest will not be awarded. Where the statute is silent about interest, and there is no express bar about payment of interest, any delay in paying the compensation or enhanced compensation for acquisition would require award of interest at a reasonable rate on equitable grounds. Proviso to Section 1 of Interest Act, 1978 also recognize and preserve the power of Court to grant interest in such circumstances.  AIR 1961 SC 908, 1985 (Supp) SCC 17- Relied.\t [Para 9,10]"

The executive order must demonstrate due application of mind on the part of the statutory authority. When the validity of an order is questioned, what would be seen is the material on which the satisfaction of the authority is based. The satisfaction of the authority although primarily subjective, should be based on objectivity. But sufficiency of material as such may not be gone into by the writ court unless it is found that in passing the impugned order the authority has failed to take into consideration the relevant facts or had based its decision on irrelevant factors not germane therefor. Mere possibility of another view may not be a ground for interference. It is not a case where malice was alleged against the third appellant. The High Court and Apex Court would undoubtedly jealously guard the fundamental rights of a citizen. While exercising the jurisdiction vested in them invariably, the courts would make all attempts to uphold the human right of the proceedee. The fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution undoubtedly must be safeguarded. But while interpreting the provisions of a statute like the present one and in view of the precedents operating in the field, the court may examine the records itself so as to satisfy its conscience not only for the purpose that the procedural safeguards available to the proceedee have been provided but also for the purpose that the witnesses have disclosed their apprehension about deposing in court truthfully and fearlessly because of the activities of the proceedee. Once such a satisfaction is arrived at, the superior court will normally not interfere with an order of externment. The court, in any event, would not direct the authorities to either disclose the names of the witnesses or the number of cases where such witnesses were examined for the simple reason that they may lead to causing of further harm to them. In a given case, the number of prosecution witnesses may not be many and the proceedee as an accused in the said case is expected to know who were the witnesses who had been examined on behalf of the prosecution and, thus, the purpose of maintaining the secrecy as regards identity of such persons may be defeated. The court must remind itself that the law is not mere logic but is required to be applied on the basis of its experience.   [Para 21,22]\n\nIt is not possible to lay down the law in precise terms in regard to externment proceeding as the facts of each case are to be considered on their own merit. In this case the High Court was not correct in coming to the finding that the third appellant was bound to disclose the cases in which the witnesses had not deposed against the respondent out of fear or because of threat, etc.\t\t\t\t\t       [Para 20,26]"

[Para 114]\n\nThe degree of care expected from an occupier of a place which is frequented everyday by hundreds and if not thousands is very high in comparison to any other place that is less frequented or more sparingly used for public functions . The higher the number of visitors to a place and the greater the frequency of such visits, the higher would be the degree of care required to be observed for their safety. The duty is continuing which starts with every exhibition of cinematograph and continues till the patrons safely exit from the cinema complex. That the patrons are admitted to the cinema for a price, makes them contractual invitees or visitors qua whom the duty to care is even otherwise higher than others. The need for high degree of care for the safety of the visitors to such public places offering entertainment is evident from the fact that the Parliament has enacted the Cinematograph Act and the Rules, which cast specific obligations upon the owners/occupiers/licensees with a view to ensuring the safety of those frequenting such places. The annual inspections and the requirements of No Objection Certificates to be obtained from authorities concerned is yet another indicator of how important the law considers the safety of the patrons to be. Any question as to the nature and the extent of breach must therefore be seen in the backdrop of the above duties and obligations that arise both under the common law and the statutory provisions alike.

That is an Act to make provisions for the constitution of a special police force in Delhi for the investigation of certain offences in the Union Territories, for the superintendence and administration of the said force and for the extension to other areas of the power and jurisdiction of the members of the said force in regards to the investigation of the said offences. Thus, the DSPE Act constitutes the Delhi Special Police Establishment. It also contains identical provisions as Section 5 of the NIA Act. By virtue of the enactment of the Central Vigilance Commission Act, 2003, certain provisions of the DSPE Act had to be amended and that is how superintendence and administration of this Special Police Establishment vests in the Central Government. Thereafter, by Section 5, the DSPE Act can be extended by the Central Government to any area including railway areas in a State, not being a Union Territory for investigation of any offences or classes of any offences specified in a notification under Section 3. Therefore, the offences of all types and nature and committed across the country can be specified in the Notification under Section 3 of the DSPE Act. Therefore, when the offences even under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 could be said to be covered and can be included in the Notification, then, the legislature thought it fit to enact Section 6 providing for consent of the State Government to enable the Special Police Force under the DSPE Act to exercise its power and jurisdiction. The NIA Act applies only to investigation and prosecution of the offences under the Acts specified in the Schedule to the NIA Act. Further, by virtue of Section 6(7) of the NIA Act it has been clarified that till the NIA takes investigation of the case by virtue of the directions issued under sub\u00adsections (4) and (5) of Section 6, it shall be duty of the officer in\u00adcharge of Police Station to continue with the investigation. Absence of Provision like S.6 of DSPE Act would not render Section 6 of the NIA Act or any of its sub\u00adsections unconstitutional, null and void. Rather, not displacing the State Government altogether, but enabling the Central Government to associate with the State Government or transfer the case to the State Government for investigation and trial of the scheduled offences as well, so also, otherwise keeping the State Government's power to investigate and prosecute any scheduled offence intact, the Parliament has not, in any manner, usurped the powers of the State or displaced it altogether.

Removal of any of the aforesaid incumbents holding any of the aforesaid posts is also contemplated on certain contingencies occurring as spelt out by subsection (3) of Section 6 of the CVC Act. No such provision has been engrafted so far as the office of the Director, CBI is concerned except what is contained in Section 4B(2) of the DSPE Act, namely, that \"the Director shall not be transferred except with the previous consent of the Committee referred to in subsection (1) of section 4A\". To be noticed, Section 4B including subsection (2) thereof of the DSPE Act, as it exists on date, were brought in by the same legislation i.e. CVC Act (Act No.45 of 2003).\n\n\tIf the legislative intent would have been to confer in any authority of the State a power to take interim measures against the Director, CBI thereby affecting his functioning, surely, the legislation would have contained enabling provisions to that effect and consequently would have been differently worded and drafted. It is against this backdrop that the words \"transferred except with the previous consent of the Committee\" mentioned in Section 4B(2) of the DSPE Act has to be understood. If the word \"transferred\" has to be understood in its ordinary parlance and limited to a change from one post to another, as the word would normally convey and on that basis the requirement of \"previous consent of the Committee\" is understood to be only in such cases, i.e. purely of transfer, such an interpretation would be self-defeating and would clearly negate the legislative intent. In such an event it will be free for the State Authority to effectively disengage the Director, CBI from functioning by adopting various modes, known and unknown, which may not amount to transfer but would still have the same effect as a transfer from one post to another, namely, cessation of exercise of powers and functions of the earlier post. This is clearly not what the legislature could have intended. The long history of evolution has shown that the institution of the CBI has been perceived to be necessarily kept away from all kinds of extraneous influences so that it can perform its role as the premier investigating and prosecuting agency without any fear and favour and in the best public interest. The head of the institution, namely, the Director, naturally, therefore, has to be the role model of independence and integrity which can only be ensured by freedom from all kinds of control and interference except to the extent that Parliament may have intended. Such intendment would require all Authorities to keep away from intermingling or interfering in the functioning of the Director. In a situation where such interference may at all be called for, public interest must be writ large against the backdrop of the necessity. The relevance and adequacy of the reasons giving rise to such a compelling necessity can only be tested by the opinion of the Committee constituted under Section 4A(1) of the DSPE Act in whom the power to make recommendations for appointment of the Director has been vested by Parliament.\n\n(1998) 1 SCC 226 Ref.to.\t [Para 34,35,36]"

Constitutional Courts are not fettered by the statutory restriction of the DSPE Act - Power of the High Court u/Art.226 of the Constitution cannot be taken away, curtailed or diluted by S.6 of the Special Police Act - Irrespective of any statutory provision acting as a restriction on the powers of the Courts, the restriction imposed by S.6 of the Special Police Act on the powers of the Union, cannot be read as restriction on the powers of the Constitutional Courts\n\nHELD:\n(i) The ongoing investigation by the CBI is held to be lawful\n(ii) Records of the case produced, does not prima facie suggest any wrong doing by Mumbai Police, though attempt made stretch the purview of S.174 without drawing up any FIR - In the event a new case is registered at Mumbai on the same issue, since most of the transactions alleged have taken place in Maharashtra, in the fitness of things, it would be appropriate if the latter case too gets investigated by the same agency, on the strength of this Court\u2019s order\n(iii) Such enabling order will make it possible for the CBI to investigate the new case, avoiding the rigors of S.6 of the DSPE Act, requiring consent from the State of Maharashtra\n\n(5) Scope of the power of a Single Judge exercising jurisdiction u/S.406 Cr.P.C and whether this Court can issue direction for doing complete justice, in exercise of plenary power u/Art.142 Constitution of India?\n(i) As a Court exercising lawful jurisdiction for the assigned roster, no impediment is seen for exercise of plenary power in the present matter. \n(ii) To ensure public confidence in the investigation and to do complete justice in the matter, this Court considers it appropriate to invoke powers conferred by Article 142 of the Constitution, to accord approval for the ongoing CBI investigation\n(iii) Further, if any other case is registered on the death of the actor Sushant Singh Rajput and the surrounding circumstances of his unnatural death, the CBI is directed to investigate the new case as well\n\nTransfer petition disposed, in above terms.\n"

                ],
                "description": "Interpretation of Statute -Words \"Cases involving arrest of a person on the spot\" mentioned in S.6A(2) - Bar of inquiry or investigation without prior approval of the Central Government would not apply to cases falling under S.6A(2) of the Act - Expression used in sub-section (2) includes trap cases - Therefore, non obstante clause would apply and there would be no bar for the CBI authorities to make inquiry or investigation before arresting the accused in a trap case.\n\nBar of inquiry or investigation without prior approval of the Central Government would not apply to cases falling under section 6-A(2). If the said section 6-A is read as a whole, it can be seen that the provision makes a clear distinction between two categories of cases viz 'cases involving arrest of a person on the spot' and all other cases. In respect of all other cases not falling within the ambit of the expression 'cases involving arrest of a person on the spot', no inquiry or investigation can be made without prior approval of the Central Government, whereas in cases falling under sub-section (2), inquiry and investigation is permissible without obtaining prior approval of the Central Government.\n\nThe crux of the entire case, therefore, would depend on the interpretation of the words 'cases involving arrest of a person on the spot'. According to the applicants, the words 'on the spot' would mean chance arrest on the spot where there is no time at all to take prior approval. On the other hand, it is the case of CBI that the meaning of the said term covers cases where there is direct evidence of corruption such as 'in trap cases' or 'in cases of assets being disproportionate to the known sources of income'.\n\nSince the entire controversy hinges on the interpretation of the said words 'cases involving arrest of a person on the spot', it would be relevant to keep in mind the observation of the Supreme Court in respect of the interpretation of the words. The Apex Court has cited with approval the following passage which is to be found from Maxwell on the Interpretation of Statute which reads as under:- \n\nThe words of statute, when there is doubt about their meaning are to be understood in the sense in which they best harmonise with the subject of the enactment. Their meaning is found not so much in a strictly grammatical or etymological propriety of language, nor even in its popular use, and the object to be attained.\n\nThe Courts have declined to be bound by letter which frustrates the patent purpose of the statute.\n\nWhere there is direct evidence of corruption available against the employee of the Central Government, he could be arrested on the spot on the basis of such direct evidence. For example, in a trap case, CBI is not prohibited from making inquiry or investigation and register an FIR, leading to the arrest of the accused in the trap laid for that purpose, without seeking approval from the Central Government.\n\nThe said expression, therefore, has to be read as a whole in the context in which it has been made and the purpose and object which it seeks to achieve. The purpose of inserting section 6-A is obviously to grant some protection to employees of the Central Government above a particular rank to a certain extent but not to grant blanket protection by sub-section 6-A(1) and to carve out exception by using the said expression. Further, it can be seen that the words used are 'cases involving' and not just the 'case involved'. Therefore, the section obviously includes various cases which are included in the said expression.\n\nOnce it is held that the said expression used in sub-section (2) includes trap cases, then non obstante clause would apply and there would be no bar for the CBI authorities to make inquiry or investigation before arresting the accused in a trap case.\n\n142 (2007) Del.

Lodha, J. (For himself and Kurian Joseph, J.) :-\n\nThere is no doubt that the objective behind the enactment of Section 6A is to give protection to certain officers (Joint Secretary and above) in the Central Government at the decision making level from the threat and ignominy of malicious and vexatious inquiries/investigations and the provision aims to ensure that those, who are in decision making positions, are not subjected to frivolous complaints and make available some screening mechanism for frivolous complaints but the question is: is the restrictive provision contained in Section 6A rendered nugatory or its objective is otherwise not achieved where the investigations into the crime under PC Act are monitored by the constitutional court? We do not think so. The constitutional courts are the sentinels of justice and have been vested with extraordinary powers of judicial review to ensure that the rights of citizens are duly protected.     [Para 48]\n\nIn the event of any senior officer (Joint Secretary or above) or the Central Government in an ongoing inquiry/investigation by the CBI being monitored by the Court has reason to believe that such officer may be unnecessarily harassed by the CBI, then the Central Government or the senior officer (Joint Secretary or above) can always apply to the Court which is monitoring the inquiry/investigation for protection of his rights. Such legal course being available to the category of officers covered by Section 6A, there is no merit in the submission that requirement of approval under Section 6A cannot be waived even in Court-monitored investigations and inquiries.      [Para 54]\n\nPer Madam B. Lokur, J. :-\n\nAssuming a senior government officer is being unfairly investigated by the CBI in a constitutional court monitored investigation without the previous approval of the Central Government, is it difficult for him or her to approach the constitutional court and present his side of the story and contend that he or she should not be investigated for an alleged offence? It is only the substitution of a forum, from a Minister to a constitutional court, which will consider the officer's request and a fair hearing given by a constitutional court certainly cannot be said to be detrimental to his or her interest. On the contrary, the protection given by a constitutional court will be more real.      [Para 91]"

The filtration mechanism which Section 6A provides to ensure that the senior officers at the decision making level are not subjected to frivolous inquiry is achieved as the constitutional court that monitors the inquiry/investigation by CBI acts as guardian and protector of the rights of the individual and, if necessary, can always prevent any improper act by the CBI against senior officers in the Central Government when brought before it. When Court monitors the investigation, there is already departure inasmuch as the investigating agency informs the Court about the progress of the investigation. Once the constitutional court monitors the inquiry/investigation which is only done in extraordinary circumstances and in exceptional situation having regard to the larger public interest, the inquiry/investigation into the crime under the PC Act against public servants by the CBI must be allowed to have its course unhindered and uninfluenced and the procedure contemplated by Section 6A cannot be put at the level which impedes exercise of constitutional power by the Supreme Court under Articles 32, 136 and 142 of the Constitution.

Lodha, J.

If Section 6 necessitates the prior sanction of the State Government before investigation is carried out by the CBI in terms of that provision and the principle of law laid down by the Constitution Bench of this Court is that the constitutional courts are empowered to direct the investigation of a case by CBI and in such cases no prior sanction of the State Government is necessary under Section 6 of the DSPE Act, there is no reason why such principle is not extended in holding that the approval of the Central Government is not necessary under Section 6A of the DSPE Act in a matter where the inquiry/investigation into the crime under the PC Act is being monitored by the Court. It is the duty of this Court that anti-corruption laws are interpreted and worked out in such a fashion that helps in minimizing abuse of public office for private gain.

That being so, Section 6A of the Act must be meaningfully and realistically read, only as an injunction to the executive and not as an injunction to a constitutional court monitoring an investigation under Article 32 of the Constitution in an exercise of judicial review and of issuing a continuing mandamus.

                "description": "Constitution of India, Art.14 - Validity of S.26(c) of Central Vigilance Commission Act and S.6A of DSPE Act - Prosecution of corrupt Government servants - Classification of public servant on basis of their status in Government service - No such distinction can be made and public servants high or low must be confronted with process of investigation into offences under P.C. Act, equally - S.6A and S.26(c) are invalid.\n\nThe classification which is made in Section 6-A on the basis of status in the Government service is not permissible under Article 14 as it defeats the purpose of finding prima facie truth into the allegations of graft, which amounts to an offence under the PC Act, 1988. Can there be sound differentiation between corrupt public servants based on their status? Surely not, because irrespective of their status or position, corrupt public servants are corrupters of public power. The corrupt public servants, whether high or low, are birds of the same feather and must be confronted with the process of investigation and inquiry equally. Based on the position or status in service, no distinction can be made between public servants against whom there are allegations amounting to an offence under the PC Act, 1988.\n\nCorruption is an enemy of the nation and tracking down corrupt public servants and punishing such persons is a necessary mandate of the PC Act, 1988. It is difficult to justify the classification which has been made in Section 6-A, because the goal of law in the PC Act, 1988 is to meet corruption cases with a very strong hand and all public servants are warned through such a legislative measure that corrupt public servants have to face very serious consequences. The purpose of a law may be either the elimination of a public mischief or the achievement of some positive public good. The classification made in Section 6-A neither eliminates public mischief nor achieves some positive public good. On the other hand, it advances public mischief and protects the crime-doer. The provision thwarts an independent, unhampered, unbiased, efficient and fearless inquiry / investigation to track down the corrupt public servants.\n\nNo distinction can be made for certain class of officers specified in Section 6-A who are described as decision making officers for the purpose of inquiry/investigation into an offence under the PC Act, 1988. There is no rational basis to classify the two sets of public servants differently on the ground that one set of officers is decision making officers and not the other set of officers. If there is an accusation of bribery, graft, illegal gratification or criminal misconduct against a public servant, then we fail to understand as to how the status of offender is of any relevance. Where there are allegations against a public servant which amount to an offence under the PC Act, 1988, no factor pertaining to expertise of decision making is involved. Yet, Section 6-A makes a distinction. It is this vice which renders Section 6-A violative of Article 14. Moreover, the result of the impugned legislation is that the very group of persons, namely, high ranking bureaucrats whose misdeeds and illegalities may have to be inquired into, would decide whether the CBI should even start an inquiry or investigation against them or not. There will be no confidentiality and insulation of the investigating agency from political and bureaucratic control and influence because the approval is to be taken from the Central Government which would involve leaks and disclosures at every stage. Corruption is an enemy of nation and tracking down corrupt public servant, howsoever high he may be, and punishing such person is a necessary mandate under the PC Act, 1988. The status or position of public servant does not qualify such public servant from exemption from equal treatment. The decision making power does not segregate corrupt officers into two classes as they are common crime doers and have to be tracked down by the same process of inquiry and investigation.

It is equally important that interested or influential persons are not able to misdirect or highjack the investigation so as to throttle a fair investigation resulting in the offenders escaping the punitive course of law. These are important facets of rule of law. Breach of rule of law, amounts to negation of equality under Article 14. Section 6-A fails in the context of these facets of Article 14. The argument that rule of law is not above law and cannot be a ground for invalidating legislations overlooks the well settled position that rule of law is a facet of equality under Article 14 and breach of rule of law amounts to breach of equality under Article 14 and, therefore, breach of rule of law may be a ground for invalidating the legislation being in negation of Article 14.\n\nAn investigation into a crime may have some adverse impact but where there are allegations of an offence under the PC Act, 1988 against a public servant, whether high or low, whether decision-maker or not, an independent investigation into such allegations is of utmost importance and unearthing the truth is the goal. The aim and object of investigation is ultimately to search for truth and any law that impedes that object may not stand the test of Article 14.           [Para 85,90]"

F of Transfer Scheme Rules, it would still have to pay the tax.\n\nThe scheme contemplated by the Delhi Electricity Reforms Act and the Rules framed therein is that the assets of the erstwhile Delhi Vidyut Board initially stood transferred and vested absolutely in the Government. The undertakings were transferred to generation, transmission and distribution companies. The shares of these companies were allotted to the Holding Company which is Delhi Power Company Ltd. which is a wholly owned Government company. Land and land rights also were transferred to the Holding Company. Thereafter the process of privatization takes place by divesting shares in the distribution companies. It is clear that the transfer of all the assets including land to the Government is a transitory step as the Holding Company is to be in total control. In the above background, the question is whether the land belongs to the Government and exempt from tax. No doubt, all the assets of Delhi Vidyut Board stood transferred and vested in the Government. It is also clear that the distribution undertaking with assets mentioned in Items I, II & III of Part I of Schedule F were transferred to the Distribution Company. The proviso to Items I, II & III of Part I of Schedule F to the Transfer Scheme Rules contemplates that land which was exclusively and primarily being used for business purpose by the transferee before the transfer does not form part of the assets transferred and the transferee would be a licnesee of the Government for the said land on payment of a nominal amount. Schedule 'G' deals with transfer in favour of the Holding Company and land and land rights is one of the entities therein. Transfer of assets and liabilities are dealt with in Schedule F and it is clear from the said Schedule that the Distribution Company is a licensee of the Government.further Government continues to be the owner of land and the entry land and land rights is vague and has to be ignored as it is not applicable to the land already covered by Schedule F. Whereas, the case of the Corporation is that there is no ambiguity in Schedule G. Land was transferred to the Holding Company and Section 119 of the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act is not applicable. The High Court held that the initial transfer and vesting of land is in the Government, then Distribution Company becomes licensee of the Government qua land and finally there is a transfer of land to the Holding Company. In view of the fact that Government was not to hold any asset and the vesting of land in the Government was only transitory in nature, the findings of the High Court that Holding Company is the owner of land is upheld.\n\n\tAccording to Section 120 (1) (c), the person who has a right to let would be liable to pay tax for un-let land. Admittedly, this land is un-let. Incidence of tax has to be decided by the Authority after taking into consideration the provisions of the Act, rules and the licences, including the distribution licence.\n\n\tSection 120 (1) (c) contemplates that a person who has the right to let out un-let land is liable to pay tax. His status as a lessor or licensee is irrelevant. If the distribution licence empowers the Distribution Company to let out the land, notwithstanding the fact that the Distribution Company is a licensee as per Schedule 'F' of the Transfer Scheme Rules, it would still have to pay the tax.\t [Para 12,19]"

This proviso means that an appeal pending before a District Judge is to be transferred compulsorily to the Taxation Tribunal (after it is set up) if an applicant requests for disposal of the appeal on the basis of annual value. Obviously, the word \"settlement\" would not in this context mean a consensual arrangement between both parties but would only mean a determination to be made by the Tribunal on the basis of annual value. Once this position becomes clear, the impugned judgment [169 DLT 352 (2010) (DB)] cannot be faulted. It is clear then that even at the appellate stage an applicant can opt to apply for the new unit area method provided for in Section 116E so that his property tax assessment may be decided in accordance with the said method even though it pertains to an assessment year prior to 2003.\n\nThe second proviso to Section 169 would apply in cases where, after the Taxation Tribunal is set up, there is no request by any applicant to determine his case on the basis of annual value. In such cases also, the Tribunal once set up may take up the appeal of such person with the approval of the earlier appellate authority, namely, the District Judge. Thus understood, it is clear that the logic of the Division Bench of the High Court cannot be faulted.\n\nThis being the position in law, an assessment that has not been finalized in all cases where an appeal is pending before the District Judge as also in all cases which have not become \"final\" in the sense that the appellate authority or the High Court or Supreme Court (after 2003), in respect of an assessment of property tax prior to 2003, remands the matter for fresh determination, would all be covered by the language of Section 116G(2).\n\n169 DLT 352 (2010) (DB) Approved.
