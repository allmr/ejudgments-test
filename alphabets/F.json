So far as the present matter is concerned, Mr. Ashtaputre has filed the affidavit that he is a person appointed under section 8 of the Factories Act by notification in the Official Gazette. In view of that position, he is a constituted Inspector under the Act, and therefore, he is competent to file the complaint.

Necessarily they have to go from one place to other. Their working in a given retail outlet could never be for a fixed period as it would necessarily depend on the type of work which the ROT has to do in connection with that particular pump. A mere servicing or checking a calibration may not take much time but if the installation is to be serviced or repaired it would definitely take more time. He will be moving from one installation to other. This he is doing as part of his duty being employed by the company to render technical assistance for the maintenance of the installation for efficient functioning of the same as also to ensure that proper quantity of the petroleum  product is being sold to the purchaser. For this purpose accuracy of the pump device is crucial. No doubt during the time that the ROT are attending to their work in a petrol pump or in the installation of a retail outlet they are working in the factory. However by that alone they cannot become factory workers. They continue to be the workers employed by the Company. There is no question of their allegiance or service standing transferred to the installation occupier for the limited period of ROT working hours. By very nature there would be number of days where there may be very less work and correspondingly there would be days where there would be very heavy load. This would eventually average into a reasonable working hours according to the company. In this background there could not be any question of Factories Act being made applicable to the limited extent of fixing the working hours only.  [Para 12,16,20,30]"

The next day i.e. Wednesday was a normally weekly off. The employees were directed under the notice to report on duty on Wednesday. The reasons given in the notice would by itself indicate that the weekly off was changed on account of shortage of material. It is a case for lay off to which the provisions of Chapter V-B of Industrial Disputes Act are attracted, and which, contemplates that, permission of Appropriate Authority is required for lay off.  It is not possible for an employer to change the weekly off solely on the ground that there was no material available for work to be provided on a particular date. Such exercise would be clearly a colourable exercise to defeat the very object of the weekly off. If in law there are statutory requirements under Chapter V-B of the Industrial Disputes Act in seeking permission before a lay-off is effected, ingenuity cannot be allowed to defeat the requirement of law. In the instant case, clearly the sole reason for change in the weekly off was shortage of material. In such a case, if the employer had to lay-off, he was bound to pay compensation. This he cannot avoid by resorting to change in the weekly off itself. The action of the Management in changing the weekly off was in violation of the requirements of Section 9A and Chapter V-B of the Industrial Disputes Act.  [Para 8,9]\n\nThe Authority exercising powers under S.33-C of the Industrial Disputes Act had jurisdiction to decide the issue whether the lay-off was in violation of Chap.V B of the Act and on finding that the lay off was illegal could grant compensation to the employees.

In any event, no factory/ classes of factories could have been exempted from compliance with provisions of the Factories Act, unless an \u2018internal disturbance\u2019 causes a grave emergency that threatens the security of the state, so as to constitute a \u2018public emergency\u2019 within the meaning of Section 5 of the Factories Act. The notifications, in denying humane working conditions and overtime wages provided by law, are an affront to the workers\u2019 right to life and right against forced labour that are secured by Articles 21 and 23 of the Constitution. Therefore said notifications exempting factories from complying with various provision relating to weekly hours, daily hours, intervals of etc for adult workers, would be liable to be quashed. (Paras 44, 45)\n\nThe economic slowdown created by the COVID-19 pandemic does not qualify as an internal disturbance threatening the security of the state. The pandemic has put a severe burden on existing, particularly public health, infrastructure and has led to a sharp decline in economic activities. The Union Government has taken recourse to the provisions of the Disaster Management Act, 2005. [Ministry of Home Affairs, Order No. 40-3/2020-DM-I(A) dated 24 March 2020] However, it has not affected the security of India, or of a part of its territory in a manner that disturbs the peace and integrity of the country. The economic hardships caused by COVID - 19 certainly pose unprecedented challenges to governance. However, such challenges are to be resolved by the State Governments within the domain of their functioning under the law, in coordination with the Central Government. Unless the threshold of an economic hardship is so extreme that it leads to disruption of public order and threatens the security of India or of a part of its territory, recourse cannot be taken to such emergency powers which are to be used sparingly under the law. Recourse can be taken to them only when the conditions requisite for a valid exercise of statutory power exist under Section 5. That is absent in the present case. (Para 28)\n\nThe impugned notifications do not serve any purpose, apart from reducing the overhead costs of all factories in the State, without regard to the nature of their manufactured products. It would be fathomable, and within the realm of reasonable possibility during a pandemic, if the factories producing medical equipment such as life-saving drugs, personal protective equipment or sanitisers, would be exempted by way of Section 65(2), while justly compensating the workers for supplying their valuable labour in a time of urgent need. However, a blanket notification of exemption to all factories, irrespective of the manufactured product, while denying overtime to the workers, is indicative of the intention to capitalize on the pandemic to force an already worn-down class of society, into the chains of servitude. (Para 36)\n\nThe need for protecting labour welfare on one hand and combating a public health crisis occasioned by the pandemic on the other may require careful balances. But these balances must accord with the rule of law. A statutory provision which conditions the grant of an exemption on stipulated conditions must be scrupulously observed. It cannot be interpreted to provide a free reign for the State to eliminate provisions promoting dignity and equity in the workplace in the face of novel challenges to the state administration, unless they bear an immediate nexus to ensuring the security of the State against the gravest of threats. (Para 38)\n\nThe expression \u2018worker\u2019 as defined in the Factories Act, is broad enough to include persons who are indirectly employed as contract labour and contribute to the manufacturing process at the establishment. [National Thermal Power Co-operation v. Karri Pothuraju, (2003) 7 SCC 384; Barat Fritz Werner Ltd. v. State of Karnataka, (2001) 4 SCC 498] The COVID-19 pandemic in India, was accompanied with an immense migrant worker crisis, where several workers (including workers employed or contracted with factories) were forced to abandon their cities of work due to the halt in production which cut-off their meagre source of income. The notifications in question legitimize the subjection of workers to onerous working conditions at a time when their feeble bargaining power stands whittled by the pandemic. Clothed with exceptional powers under Section 5, the state cannot permit workers to be exploited in a manner that renders the hard-won protections of the Factories Act, 1948 illusory and the constitutional promise of social and economic democracy into paper-tigers. It is ironical that this result should ensue at a time when the state must ensure their welfare. (Para 43)\n\nIn the facts and as a consequence of this judgment, and in the interest of doing complete justice under Article 142 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court directed that overtime wages shall be paid, in accordance with the provisions of Section 59 of the Factories Act to all eligible workers who have been working since the issuance of the notifications.

In our view, obviously, in a situation which is beyond his technical competence, DISH can very well avail of independent expert opinion. The present case was eminently one in which DISH should have referred the matter to an outside independent expert. There were two conflicting reports - one by IES and the other by AERB - with regard to the hazardous nature of Respondent No.8's facility. The facility of cryogenic storage being the first one proposed to be installed in India, the DISH did not have either the technical expertise or previous experience of handling such a case. In these circumstances, that R.K. Garg, as expert whose credentials appears to be above board, was appointed by DISH to give an independent opinion, does not in any way militate against the provisions of the Factories Act, 1948. In our judgment, the action of DISH was very much in accordance with the provisions of the Factories Act, 1948.  [Para 77]"

That is why the AERB Report does not consider such catastrophic rupture of storage tanks as a credible possible scenario. In our view, the stand taken by Respondent Nos. 8 and 9 appears to be justified. Since foresight of all future events is impossible, technology proceeds by forecasting future events for practical purposes on the basis of probabilities. Theoretically, everything in life is fraught with risk. Flying by aeroplane or travelling by care or automobiles has an inherent risk, but that cannot deter normal human activity in these areas. Similarly, the establishment of any factory is fraught with some amount of risk and, particularly so, if it is a factory dealing with hazardous material. There are always conflicting claims between absolute safety and needs of development. One scientific way of resolving this conflict is to estimate the probability of a hazardous event occurring and determination of the probability level which would be acceptable contemporary human standards. Science and technology have striven to do this and ensured that the probability of hazards is kept as low as possible. The technical literature produced before us suggests that Internationally a probability of 10e-5 to 10e-6 is considered as an acceptable level of risk. In other words, the probability of an accident occurring once in a million years is considered acceptable risk. As far as Respondent No.8's facility is concerned, the probability of risk appears to be 10e-9 which is far safer than the acceptable safety standards.  [Para 145]"

The position is same if we consider definition of 'worker' u/s 2(1) of the Factories Act, 1948.  [Para 19]\n\nIn the present case, The respondent company employing more than 250 workers in its factory was running a canteen through a contractor by agreement between them. The canteen was required to be provided and maintained by the company for its workers as a welfare activity u/s 46 of the factories Act 1948. The canteen employees were employed by the contractor and there was no privity of contract between the company and the canteen employees. Under the agreement the company was to supply at its own cost the cooking utensils, crockery etc. Uniforms worn by the employees including head gear was to be specified by the company. The electricity, water, fuel, furniture and fixtures were to be given by the company without any charges. The company was to be the sole judge regarding the standard of quality of food. Wages were to be paid by the contractor to the employees, but it was to submit regularly to the company all details regarding attendence, weekly off days, wages, etc. General power was given to the company regarding overall supervision. Much of the control over the functioning of the canteen was retained by the company and much of the discretion of the contractor was taken awary.\n\nHeld that there being responsibility to provide and maintain a canteen for the workmen u/s 46 on the company, the employees of the canteen would become automatically the employees of the company. Merely because the principal employer was registered u/s 7 and the contractor obtained licence u/s 12 of the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act 1970 and there was no notification issued u/s 10 of the said Act, it cannot be said that the canteen employees cannot be treated as employees of company or there would be abolition of the contract. Registration of principal employer u/s 7 and obtaining a licence by the contractor u/s 12 was not relevant while considering the statutory provision u/s 46 when those employees would be treated as employees of the company for all purposes, it cannot be said that the company would be prohibited to run or manage the canteen through an agency permissible under law.  [Para 23,24]\n\nS.46 itself provides that if the requirements thereof are complied then the canteen workers are to be deemed as employees of the principal employer. It is not necessary to provide specifically any fiction when the definition of 'worker' contained in s.2(1) provides to include employees employed through any agency including a contractor and who were engaged in any manufacturing process or any kind of work incidental to, or connected with, the manufacturing process, or the subject of the manufacturing process. Even assuming that the contractor was an independent contractor, in view of Section 46 and further the fact that the canteen is incidental to or connected with the manufacturing process, it becomes part of the company. It is a necessry concomitant of the manufacturing activity of the company. Obviously proper nourishment can bring in better production. Further, in the present case, we are concerned with giving effect to S.46 and not with the position under general law.  [Para 22,27,30]\n\nNo doubt an aggrieved party can approach the Factories Inspector for claiming certain reliefs. It may be possible for the Inspector to direct the company to have a canteen if the provisionsof s.46 are applicable to it. But the declaration as sought by the petitioenr that the canteen employees be treated as company workers cannot be granted by the Factories Inspector. In any case it is not possible and desirable to ask the petitioner to approach the Factories Inspector when it is seeking to enforece a statutory duty cast u/s 46.\n\nAIR 1973 SC 2297, AIR 1990 SC 937, AIR 1972 SC 1598, JT 1995(3) SC 288 and 1995(2) Goa L.T. 19 Foll.

In the instant case, insofar as appellants are concerned, construction of building is not their business activity or manufacturing process. In fact, the building is being constructed for carrying out the particular manufacturing process, which is generation, transmission and distribution of power. Obviously, the workers who are engaged in construction of the building also do not fall within the definition of 'worker' under the Factories Act. \t [Para 21]\n\n\tMerely because the appellants have obtained a licence under Section 6 of the Factories Act for registration to work a factory, it would not follow therefrom that they answer the description of the \"factory\" within the meaning of the Factories Act. Court reproduced the definition of 'factory' and a bare reading thereof makes it abundantly clear that before this stage, when construction of project is completed and the manufacturing process starts, 'factory' within the meaning of Section 2(m) of the Factories Act does not come into existence so as to be covered by the said Act. \t [Para 23]\n\n\tThe provisions of the Factories Act would \"apply\" only when the manufacturing process starts for which the building/project is being constructed and not to the activity of construction of the project.\n\n(1979) 4 SCC 573 Rel. on. \t [Para 25]\n\n\tSection 2(d) of the BOCW Act dealing with the building or construction work is in three parts. In the first part, different activities are mentioned which are to be covered by the said expression, namely, construction, alterations, repairs, maintenance or demolition. Second part of the definition is aimed at those buildings or works in relation to which the aforesaid activities are carried out. The third part of the definition contains exclusion clause by stipulating that it does not include 'any building or other construction work to which the provisions of the Factories Act, 1948 or the Mines Act, 1952 applies'. Thus, first part of the definition contains the nature of activity; second part contains the subject matter in relation to which the activity is carried out and third part excludes those building or other construction work to which the provisions of Factories Act or Mines Act apply.\n\n\tIn the instant case, it is not in dispute that construction of the projects of the appellants is covered by the definition of \"building or other construction work\" as it satisfies first two elements of the definition pointed out above. In order to see whether exclusion clause applies, we need to interpret the words 'but does not include any building or other construction work to which the provisions of the Factories Act ............ apply'. The question is as to whether the provisions of the Factories Act apply to the construction of building/project of the appellants. We are of the firm opinion that they do not apply. The provisions of the Factories Act would \"apply\" only when the manufacturing process starts for which the building/project is being constructed and not to the activity of construction of the project. That is how the exclusion clause is to be interpreted and that would be the plain meaning of the said clause. \t [Para 24,25]"

Explanation II of Section 2(m) of the Factories Act is inserted in the Factories Act and not in the E.S.I. Act. It marks difference in its interpretation and application. In the definition of \"factory\" under Factories Act the words \"worker working\" are used, while in the E.S.I. Act, in the section defining \"factory\", the term \"person employed for wages\" are used. A difference in these two definition of one word \"factory\" can be explained by example. A clerk or staff in the premises is not covered under the definition of \"worker\" under the Factories Act, however, under the ESI Act, the word \"worker\" is not used but the legislature chose the word \"person\" and for \"working\", the word \"employed\" is used. Thus, the premises where person is employed for a clerical work is covered under the definition \"factory\" under the E.S.I. Act. Therefore, definition of \"factory\" has wider meaning under the ESI Act than the Factories Act.\n\nIf manufacturing process is carried out as contemplated under Section 2(12) of the E.S.I. Act, then that particular unit cannot be made an exception to the application of the E.S.I. Act. To borrow the meaning from the provision of Explanation II of Section 2(m) of the Factories Act, will be a mayopic view defeating the object and spirit of the E.S.I. Act. The meaning of the term \"factory\" for the purpose of E.S.I. Act is not to be understood in the context of Explanation II of Section 2(m) of the Factories Act.

Act shall have the meaning assigned to it u/s.2(k) of Factories Act. While reading Explanation-II of Section 2(m) of the Factories Act, the phrase \"if no manufacturing process is carried on\" is to be read necessarily in respect of the substance manufactured in the premises by any means or any method including the computer. The language of Explanation-II is to be read in a literal sense by applying rule of literal interpretation.\n\nMany verbs describing different activities are mentioned in the said definition. It is true that each activity and verb has its own connotation. The Factories Act was enacted in 1948 and at the relevant time, use of computer and software was alien to the Legislature. Naturally, the words which are more appropriate, precisely describing the activities carried out with the help of the computers i.e. development of software, programming of data, application etc. were neither known nor in practice at the relevant time when the Act was enacted. Albeit, the absence of these words, the manufacturing of the substance with the help of computers can be covered generally under the activities which are mentioned in the definition of manufacturing process as making, altering, treating, adapting etc. Thus, the Section defining manufacturing process allows a wide interpretation. This can be substantiated by giving example that some other activities like turning, milling, fitting welding, drilling, ironing, cooking, painting etc. are not specifically mentioned in the definition of manufacturing activities though these are considered as manufacturing process at various work places and covered under different 'verbs' used in the definition of manufacturing process. Therefore, though computer related activities like development, programming, application are not mentioned in the definition and to that effect there is no amendment in the section; the definition takes care of activities like development and application.

Health is an integral facet of life. Absent good health, life is deprived of the rationale for existence. Deprive a worker of her health and she loses her means of livelihood. Deprivation of livelihood constitutes the social destruction of the family unit of the wage earner. The aspirations of a whole generation depend upon the ability of the wage earner to provide support for the family. The loss of livelihood upon termination of service on grounds of continued ill health relegates the industrial worker and all those who depend on the workman to the margins of existence. Support for the preservation and enjoyment of good health is hence an important obligation of the State and the employer. There can be no contracting out of such obligations.

Special provisions have been made for regulating hazardous processes. These provisions are supplemented by other salutary provisions such as the appointment of Safety Officers under Section 40-B and for the conduct of safety and occupational health surveys in Section 91-A. Detailed provisions have been made for the appraisal of hazardous processes, the disclosure of information by occupiers, provision of medical facilities, maintenance of health records, prescribing permissible limits of exposure to chemical and toxic substances, and for laying down emergency standards. The right of workers to be fully informed on issues concerning health and to participate in safety management are instances of rights which are constitutionally recognised and implemented by legislation.\n\nIgnorance is a powerful barrier to the fulfillment of socioeconomic rights. In matters of workers' safety, ignorance of rights is compounded by the economic necessity of sustaining livelihood. Economic necessity poses a serious constraint upon workers complaining about conditions of work. The choice is between economic death, as industrial law often describes the consequences of termination, or disease, debilitation and death caused by working in a hazardous environment. Prospective workers have no bargaining power to scrutinise working conditions. Present workers are chilled into silence. Past workers are lost in the oblivion of faded memories. The regulatory authority entrusted with the task of enforcing statutory standards designed to promote health, safety and welfare of workers, therefore, has a vital role to play in the achievement of statutory norms.\n\nAs this case demonstrates, the absence of updated medical records results in a virtual denial of access to justice. In the absence of information, factory workers and all those who espouse the cause of workers cannot realistically attempt to redress the systemic failure on the part of the regulated industry to maintain mandatory standards. Workers drawn from near and far to a place of employment disperse, often without a trace into far flung villages after employment ceases. In the absence of any social security that will tide over their physical and mental afflictions erstwhile industrial workers are lost to the unorganised sector. Once dispersed, the workers are difficult to access. New workers are available to fill in the breach in a labour surplus economy. Unless employers are rigidly held down to a regime of strict compliance, a relaxed regime of enforcement and the minimal penalties for a defaulting employer furnish no disincentive to non compliance or, worse still, to evasion. As this case itself shows, the Factory Inspectorates are woefully understaffed. The available staff does not possess requisite training necessary for dealing with complex industrial processes and hazards which they are liable to pose to the health of workers. Record keeping is in a primitive stage. It is only when a litigation confronts an employer that some remedial measures are taken to alter the existing state of affairs. Court would, therefore, impress upon the Central and the State Governments the need to take immediate steps to rectify the situation and to be alive to the dangers to which industrial workers are being increasingly exposed in hazardous employments.\n\n(i) The State and the Central Governments should consider taking immediate steps for filling up the sanctioned strength of Factory Inspectors and of Certifying Surgeons;\n\n(ii) The staff of the Factory Inspectorates should be adequately and regularly trained to deal with their functions and where specialised staff is required, such staff should be specially recruited for this work to the extent to which it is feasible;\n\n(iii) In the case of factories involved in hazardous processes, the Government concerned shall consider issuing directions to the Factory Inspectors to visit every factory within their jurisdiction at least once in a period of three months for the purposes of taking samples in accordance with the provisions of Section 91 of the Factories Act, 1948. Records of these visits must be maintained;\n\n(iv) The medical examination of workers which is to be conducted under Section 41-E of the Factories Act, 1948 should be such as would enable an identification of diseases and illnesses which are a likely outcome of the process and material used in the factory;\n\n(v) Copies of medical records of workmen must be handed over to them as and when medical examinations are conducted and the appropriate Government will consider the issuance of suitable directions mandating the permanent preservation of medical records in the electronic form by factories engaged in hazardous processes;\n\n(vi) In respect of factories involved in hazardous process, safety and occupational health surveys as required by Section 91-A should invariable be carried out at the time of renewal of licences, apart from other times;\n\n(vii) The State Government shall consider issuance of directions for the appointment of Safety Officers in the case of factories involved in hazardous processes under Section 40-B(1)(ii) irrespective of the size of the factory and the number of workers employed therein;\n\n(viii)\tThe operations of the Factories' Inspectorates must be computerised. Modern methods of preserving data in the electronic form including digitisation of records must be adopted.\t [Para 18,21]"

The workmen in instant case were working on Lift Irrigation Schemes which are used for pumping water.  Therefore, the establishment is a factory.  Automatically the provisions of Chapter VB will be applicable as admittedly more than 100 workmen were employed in the industrial establishment.  Therefore, provisions of Section 25N were required to be complied with by the employer before retrenchment of workmen.  Admittedly, these provisions have been breached by the employer.  No application for permission under sub-section (1) of S.25-N was made to the appropriate Government for retrenchment, and therefore such retrenchment shall be deemed to be illegal from the date on which the notice of retrenchment was given to the workman and the workman is entitled to all benefits as if no notice had been given to him.

This limit was reduced to 10 when the process was carried out with the aid of power. Obviously, since use of power reduces the need of work force. The object is to ensure that an establishment does not escape from the applicability of benevolent provisions of these statutes by using power to mechanize processes and reduce work force.  Thus if power has been used for performing a task for which labour would have otherwise been required, then such a process aided by power would be relevant. No amount of manpower is likely to achieve preserving articles by cooling them, which a freezer does, or cooling bottles for which a bottle cooler is used. Therefore, use of these gadgets does not bring the establishment within the ambit of Employee's State Insurance Act, so long as it employs less than 20 persons.\tMoreover, provisions of the Act are made applicable to factories employing 20 persons or even 10 persons when manufacturing process is aided by power.

Thus, \"adapt\" would not mean using the thing or article as it is.  To adapt means to make an article suitable by remodeling so as to conform to a situation or an environment.  Even according to the Concise Law Dictionary \"To Adapt\" means to make suitable, to alter as to fit for a new use, to change by adaptation, etc.  Thus, it cannot be said by any stretch of imagination that the word \"adapt\" means that the thing or article is itself fit and suitable.  As can be seen from the Dictionary meaning, something more has to be done to the article by adopting it.  In fact, adaptation would mean a process of modifying a thing so as to suit a new condition.  Thus, the use of air conditioner could have been said to be covered under the definition of the word \"manufacturing process\" only if some alternations were done to the air conditioner or the air conditioner was modified to make it suitable for some new use.  Mere use of sir conditioners in the lodging rooms for the comfort of the customers would not be sufficient to hold that the employer Hotel was carrying on \"manufacturing process\" within the meaning of Section 2(k) of the Factories Act.  Since it is not the case of the Corporation that any other process mentioned in Section 2(k)(i) of the Factories Act was experienced by or carried on, on the air conditioner with a view to its use, it cannot be said that the Corporation was justified in passing the order under Section 45-A of the Act as the only term applicable in the instant case, according to the Corporation was \"adapting\" and as already pointed out herein above, the word 'adapting' could not be applied to the facts of this case as the air conditioner was not 'adapted' for its use in the hotel room.  1995(II) CLR 70 & 1987 Lab.I.C. 1197 - Dist.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 11]"

While implementing the beneficial law, this aspect cannot be forgotten. Therefore, the complainant, officer of the Mumbai Municipal Corporation, was under obligation to inform himself of explanation II provided to Section 2(m) of the Factories Act.  Had he done that, this complaint which has been filed by him before the learned Magistrate would not have come in existence and would not have been presented before that Court, and that would have avoided possibility of there being prosecution initiated against the petitioner.  The prosecution which has been brought in existence against the petitioner is against the provisions of Section 2(m) explanation II of the Act. Such I.T. units, units employing more than 20 persons, using electricity as power or manual power for its work by way of use of computers or otherwise and the units are meant not for manufacturing any new thing cannot be brought under the purview of Section 390 of Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act and other similar provisions, because, the main provision of Section 2(m) Explanation II cannot be forgotten.  For bringing the case under provisions of section 390 or parallel provisions, the complainant has to satisfy that the unit is really falling under the term \"factory\" as contemplated by Factories Act. If not, there would be no application to it of Section 390 of Corporation Act.  Therefore, the judgment of the Bombay High Court in Criminal Appeal No.1461/1968 on which the complainant's side wants to place reliance cannot help it, because in those days, the computers were not in common use in India and its use for day to day life was not a phenomenon.

Rule 3(B) of the Recruitment & Service Rules states that a candidate by nomination for the post of Judge, Family Court is required to be \"ordinarily\" not less than 35 years of age, as opposed to Clause 2(1) of the advertisement which states that such a candidate must on the date of the advertisement, not be less than 35 years of age.  [Para 8]\n\nThus, the Recruitment and Service Rules have maintained a flexibility regarding the minimum age requirement and avoided to use the word \"must\" and the Rules have deliberately used the word \"ordinarily\" and the said word must be given its natural meaning and it cannot be replaced or made otiose/redundant by the High Court administration. As per the dictionary meaning, the word \"ordinarily\" means \"generally\" or \"as far as possible\". Thus even if the High Court was justified in fixing the cut-off date as 27th September, 2009 for eligibility criteria, so far as the minimum age is concerned there has to be a flexibility rather than rigidity and if on the date of the application or as on the last date prescribed to receive the applications if the candidate would meet the requirement of minimum age, there is no reason to adopt a rigid stand to hold such a candidate ineligible.\n\nConsequently, the petitioner as well as other two candidates cannot be held to be ineligible candidates on the ground that they did not complete the age of 35 years as on 27th September, 2009. It was held that they are eligible candidates as they completed the age of 35 years either on the date they submitted the applications or on the last date prescribed to receive their applications.

                "description": "Custody of children - Rift between paternal and maternal families over succession to religious head of Dawoodi Bohara Community - Question of custody of nine children - While deciding parental rights, prime consideration should be welfare of children. \n\nThere are several parameters that go into the decision making process for determining where the welfare of the children lies. Parental conduct, material well being of the children, blood ties and kinship, age of the children, their sex, re-marriage of the parents, continuity of care and wishes of the children are some of the relevant parameters. The list is obviously not exhaustive. A balancing exercise has to be undertaken by the Court in an attempt to reach a decision which might best serve the children's welfare. The problem cannot be solved arithmetically or quantitatively by using some sort of 'points system'.\t   [Para 24]\n\nBefore a decision based upon 'wishes of the children' is arrived at, regard must be had to the age and maturity levels of the children, the circumstances in which the children are placed, the children's perception as to their own welfare, possibility of tutoring and indoctrination, dominant position of the custodial parent and other such considerations. Further, it is necessary to create, as far as possible, circumstances conducive to the exercise of intelligent preference by the children. \t [Para 29]\n\nThe 'wishes of the children' have to be ascertained in the proper manner and by the proper authority before any decision is based upon them. One of the appropriate ways of ascertaining the 'wishes of the children' will be by means of interviews and interactions with skilled Welfare Officers or Counselors. The traditional view is, however, that the decision must be seen to be taken by parents or the Court, so that the responsibility for the decision does not rest with the children. \n\nIn matters of custody and access, the Family Court should be conscious that it is not merely enforcing parental rights or determining the rights of the parents. In such proceedings, there are not two parties - the husband and the wife - but also a third party - the children. That third party is the most important party in such proceedings. Rigid formal procedures, which invariably inhere civil proceedings before Courts of law, need not come in the way of the Family Courts determining the welfare of the children. \t\t\t\t [Para 31]"

However, one has to understand that matters under section 125 are not purely criminal of nature, but proceedings are of quasi civil nature, as issue of maintenance to wife is involved and therefore, the respondent is not an accused and statement under section 313 is not recorded while dealing section 125. So, the proceedings under section 125 are not treated as purely and strictly criminal proceedings, though the power to issue warrant is given to the Court.\n\n\nChapter IV of the Family Court Act, 1984 lays down the procedure which is to be followed by the Family Court. Section 9 is about the duty of the Family Court to make efforts for settlement. Under section 9, the Family Court shall make efforts in the first instance, wherever it is possible for settlement between the parties and for that purpose, it can follow such procedure as it may deem fit. Section 9 is exclusively about the settlement and section 10 is about the procedure which is to be followed generally. Under section 10(1) of the Family Court Act, the Family Court shall be deemed to be a Civil Court and shall have all the powers of such Court dealing with all the matters except the matters covered under Chapter IX of the Cr.P.C. for grant of maintenance under section 125 of the Cr. P.C. Section 10(2) states that for the purpose of conducting the matters of maintenance under section 125 of Cr. P.C., the provisions of Cr. P.C. and rules made thereunder shall apply to the proceedings before the Family Court. It means that the Family Court while dealing with the issue of maintenance shall follow the procedure under Cr. P.C. which empowers the Court to issue warrants, pass order of interim maintenance and follow the procedure under section 126 of Cr. P.C. Hence, the evidence is to be recorded in the presence of the respondent. However, the power to hear ex-parte is also given to the Magistrate if the respondent is deliberately avoiding the service of summons or attendance in Court. \t\t\t\t [Para 6,7,9]"

The Guardians and Wards Act was enacted in 1890 and the High Court exercising its ordinary original civil jurisdiction is considered a District Court under that Act. The High Court's jurisdiction has been ousted in the light of the provisions of the Family Courts Act in case of guardianship proceedings instituted by a relative of a minor for guardianship of the minor's person. Such a proceeding clearly falls within the purview of section 7 of the Family Courts Act. Therefore, only the Family Court would have jurisdiction in view of the provisions of section 20. By virtue of section 20, the Family Courts Act has an overriding effect over any other law.  However, the High Court will continue to exercise its ordinary original civil jurisdiction in respect of petitions relating to the guardianship of the property of a minor. Therefore, a Guardianship Petition seeking guardianship of the person of a minor filed by either the parents or any relative of a minor would lie before the Family Court, irrespective of whether there is a matrimonial dispute pending before that Court.

Rule 3(B) of the Recruitment & Service Rules states that a candidate by nomination for the post of Judge, Family Court is required to be \"ordinarily\" not less than 35 years of age, as opposed to Clause 2(1) of the advertisement which states that such a candidate must on the date of the advertisement, not be less than 35 years of age.  [Para 8]\n\nThus, the Recruitment and Service Rules have maintained a flexibility regarding the minimum age requirement and avoided to use the word \"must\" and the Rules have deliberately used the word \"ordinarily\" and the said word must be given its natural meaning and it cannot be replaced or made otiose/redundant by the High Court administration. As per the dictionary meaning, the word \"ordinarily\" means \"generally\" or \"as far as possible\". Thus even if the High Court was justified in fixing the cut-off date as 27th September, 2009 for eligibility criteria, so far as the minimum age is concerned there has to be a flexibility rather than rigidity and if on the date of the application or as on the last date prescribed to receive the applications if the candidate would meet the requirement of minimum age, there is no reason to adopt a rigid stand to hold such a candidate ineligible.\n\nConsequently, the petitioner as well as other two candidates cannot be held to be ineligible candidates on the ground that they did not complete the age of 35 years as on 27th September, 2009. It was held that they are eligible candidates as they completed the age of 35 years either on the date they submitted the applications or on the last date prescribed to receive their applications.

The wordings contained in Section 9(1), \"where it is possible to do so consistent with the nature and the circumstances of case\" would clearly indicate that the endeavour by the Court to assist and to persuade the parties in arriving at a settlement is required only if it is possible to do so in consistent with the nature and circumstances of the case. It is intended only to facilitate the parties to arrive at a settlement \"in respect of the subject matter of the suit or proceedings\". In a case of joint application filed on mutual consent seeking dissolution of the marriage, it is evident that the parties have already arrived at a settlement with respect to the issues relating to the matrimonial discord and regarding continuance of the marital relationship. It is on the basis of such a settlement that the joint petition is filed. Therefore there is no necessity existing in the circumstances of a case to persuading the parties to arrive at a settlement in respect of the subject matter of the suit or proceedings, because, as found above, the settlement in all the matrimonial cases need not invariably be that of a reconciliation or reunion of the parties to the marriage. But it can also be by facilitating a peaceful judicial separation by way of dissolution of the legal relationship. Hence the endeavour which should be made by the Family court under the mandate of Section 9(1) need not be followed as a compulsory procedure in the case of a joint application for divorce on mutual consent. If the court is satisfied about the genuineness of the application, it can definitely dispense with the procedure of counselling in such cases. However, the insistence for the statutory waiting period and the subsequent ascertainment of the attitude of the parties with respect to their determination of getting the marital relationship dissolved, is totally mandatory and need to be strictly adhered. However, above finding will not preclude the Family Court from making an endeavour for a settlement of reunion of the spouses, if it is found that there is a chance for such a settlement. \t [Para 7]"

It sometimes happens that not only our decisions, but even exchanges between Bar and Bench are widely reported in the media, very often for reasons that are merely salacious and have little or nothing to do with findings in law. The law permits courts to handle such cases in privacy. There are provisions, for instance, for in camera hearings. S.11 of the Family Courts Act, 1984, the purpose of such provisions is not far removed from the present objective. These are all personal matters, often touching issues of profound intimacy and privacy. These should, remain between the parties. Courts must decide the cases according to law, but if Courts can do so without harming the personal sentiments, privacy and deep-seated beliefs of individuals, then that it is an endeavour Courts are equally duty-bound to make. \t\t       [Para 2]"

The reason for enactment of the said Act was to set up a Court which would deal with disputes concerning the family by adopting an approach radically different from that adopted in ordinary civil proceedings.  The said Act was enacted despite the fact that Order 32A of the Code of Civil Procedure was inserted by reason of the Code of Civil Procedure (Amendment) Act, 1976, which could not bring about any desired result.  It is now a well-settled principle of law that the jurisdiction of a Court created specially for resolution of disputes of certain kinds should be construed liberally.  The restricted meaning if ascribed to Explanation (c) appended to Section 7 of the Act, would frustrate the object wherefor the Family Courts were set up.  The Statement of Objects and Reasons, as referred to hereinbefore, would clearly go to show that the jurisdiction of the Family Court extends, inter alia, in relation to properties of spouses or of either of them which would clearly mean that the properties claimed by the parties thereto as a spouse of other, irrespective of the claim whether property is claimed during the subsistence of a marriage or otherwise.  The submission to the effect that Court should read the words \"a suit or proceeding between the parties to a marriage as parties to a subsisting marriage, in our considered view would lead to miscarriage of justice.\t [Para 11,14]"

It cannot be disputed that admissibility presupposes relevancy as admissibility is founded on law whereas relevancy is determined by Court using judicial skills, logic and experience. Admissibility does not signify that a particular fact stands proved but merely that such a fact is received by the Court for the purpose of being weighed.Considering the above object and the intention of the legislature, in providing for a departure, from the normal rules of evidence under the EvidenceAct, there was no embargo for the Family Court to accept and exhibit the documents as sought bythe petitioner-wife in present case. \t\t\t\t [Para 7,9,11,12]"

One of the objects of the legislation as Clause 2 (h) of the Statement of Object and Reasons would provide is \"simplify the rules of evidence and procedure so as to enable a Family Court to deal effectively with a dispute\".

As the non-obstante clause used in Section 21 of the Act of 2005 does not refer to any particular statute or provision or provisions of a particular statute and rather it is general in nature, the Court has to determine the scope of its use very strictly. The law is that when a non obstante clause is used in the aforesaid fashion, the extent of its impact has to be found out on the basis of consideration of the intent and purpose of insertion of such a clause. When a non obstante clause is used in such a blanket fashion the Court has to determine the scope of its use very strictly. Section 8 of the Act of 1984 confers exclusive jurisdiction upon the Family Court in relation to the suits and proceedings of the nature mentioned in explanation to Section 7 of the Act. Although, Section 21 of the Act of 2005 also contains the non obstance clause, but the same has limited application and despite being subsequent legislation it cannot have overriding effect on the Act of 1984. When both the enactments have the non obstante clause then in that case the proper perspective would be that one has to see the subject and dominant purpose for which the special enactment was made and in case the dominant purpose is covered by the contingencies, then notwithstanding that the Act might have come at a later point of time still the intention can be ascertained by looking to the objects and reasons. The Act of 1984 was specially meant for establishment of special Courts so that matters referred in explanation to Section 7 of the Act can be dealt by the special Courts established for that purpose whereas the object of enactment of the Act of 2005 was to protect the woman from being victim of the domestic violence and to prevent the occurrence of domestic violence in the society. Provisions of the Act of 1984 shall have overriding effect on all other enactments in force dealing with the issue of custody of a minor.  [Para 10,11]"

Pendency or filing of an application for protection order or any other relief under the DV Act is must and in such proceeding the issue of interim custody can be raised. The reason being that it is also issue of domestic violence as it harms the mental health of an aggrieved person who maintains a perception and is capable of demonstrating at least in a prima facie manner, that welfare of the child is being undermined. The nature of the power is temporary and coterminous with the main application filed for protection or any other relief. It begins with filing of such main application and comes to an end with disposal of the main application or may merge with the final decision rendered in the proceeding. Such being the nature and purpose of power of the Magistrate under S. 21 of the DV Act, it would have to be said that it is separate and independent from and not covered by either of the parts of Section 7 of the Act, 1984. An application filed under S. 21 of the DV Act does not come under the effulgence of Section 8(b) of the Act, 1984 which bars specifically the jurisdiction of the Magistrate, in relation to an area where a Family Court has been established, only under Chapter IX of the Cr.P.C., and not under any other law for the time being in force. Thus, application filed under S. 21 of the DV Act seeking interim custody is maintainable before a Magistrate exercising jurisdiction in relation to an area where Family Court is established and the Magistrate has jurisdiction to decide such an application in accordance with law. Irresistible conclusion further would be that the application filed under S. 21 of the DV Act before the Court of Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Amravati in the instant case is tenable and the impugned orders cannot be assailed on the ground of want of jurisdiction, they being a nullity. 2015(6) LRC 328 (Rajasthan), 2015 ALL MR (Cri) JOURNAL 23 - Dissented from.

The welfare of the minor being the paramount consideration, the power to grant interim maintenance will have to be read in aforesaid provisions. Moreover, during pendency of proceedings when it is brought to the notice of the Court that the welfare of the minor requires to be taken care of by directing one party to pay an amount of interim maintenance, such power can surely be exercised in the facts of the case.  [Para 12]\n\nMerely because by amending the said Act a provision for payment of maintenance is sought to be made, the same does not mean that the Courts had no power prior to such amendment to award interim maintenance. In fact, by the proposed amendment, the power to grant interim maintenance is sought to be specifically granted in place of such implied power that is available with the Court. Considering the object of the said Act and the settled position of law that welfare of the minor is the paramount consideration, the power to grant interim maintenance has to be read in the powers conferred by Section 12(1) of the said Act.  [Para 13]\n\nUnder Section 10(1) of the Family Courts Act, 1984, the Family Court is deemed to be a civil Court and provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 are applicable to the proceedings before it. Therefore, in an appropriate case before it, the Family Court in exercise of its inherent powers under Section 151 of the Code can even otherwise direct payment of interim maintenance to the minor child in proceedings under Section 7 of the Guardian and Wards Act.

(1908), S.151, O.1 R.10, O.23 R.1A - Declaration of guardianship and grant of custody of child - Procedure - Family Court does not have plenary power to do away with mandatory procedural requirements - Application by appellant-father for guardianship and custody of minor child - He also filed applications for amendment of plaint - Application by his counsel seeking discharge in case, allowed without issuing notice to appellant - Assumption by Family Court about factum of abandonment of proceedings, not proper - Respondent-wife filed application for transposition as petitioner in said proceedings and declaring her as sole guardian and grant custody of child - Respondent in fact had not filed written statement in petition - Order passed by Family Court declaring mother as sole, exclusive and absolute guardian and granting custody of child to wife and issuing notice and serving applications filed by her on appellants - Amounts to substantial non-compliance of principles of natural justice - Liable to be set aside.\n\nBoth the enactments (Family Courts Act 1984 and the Guardian and Wards Act 1890), provide for procedure in the form of disclosures, declarations and assertions and its refutations by the other party opposing the claim, whereafter the matter proceeds for recording of evidence followed by the declaration or order passed by the Court. Intrinsic in all these steps is to guarantee fair opportunity to all concerned. (Para 31)\n\nFamily Court is expected to follow procedure known to law, which means insist for a formal pleading to be filed by both sides, then frame issues for determination, record evidence of the parties to prove the facts asserted by the concerned party and only thereafter, to enter upon determination and render decision thereon by recording reasons for such decision. For doing this, the Family Court is expected to give notice to the respective parties and provide them sufficient time and opportunity to present their claim in the form of pleadings and evidence before determination of the dispute. Family Court, in the present case, exceeded its jurisdiction by hastening the entire proceedings. Indubitably, the Family Court is obliged to inquire into the matter as per the procedure prescribed by law. It does not have plenary powers to do away with the mandatory procedural requirements in particular, which guarantee fairness and transparency in the process to be followed and for adjudication of claims of both sides. The nature of inquiry before the Family Court is, indeed, adjudicatory. It is obliged to resolve the rival claims of the parties and while doing so, it must adhere to the norms prescribed by the statue in that regard and also the foundational principle of fairness of procedure and natural justice. (Paras 27, 29)\n\nIn the instant Case the appellant, father had filed the petition by invoking provisions of Section 7 of the 1890 Act read with Section 7(g) of the 1984 Act. Admittedly, no written statement was ever filed by the respondent to oppose the said petition. On the other hand, the appellant took out two applications for amendment of the pleadings under O.6 R.17 CPC. No reply was filed by the respondent even to these applications, despite Court directing her to do so vide order dated 4.10.2018. There is nothing on record to indicate that the Family Court decided these two applications for amendment of pleadings taken out by the appellant. Although the main objection alongwith two applications for amendment filed by the appellant remained pending from February, 2018, the respondent never filed response to the main petition or the amendment applications and instead took out application under Section 151 of the CPC for being appointed the sole and absolute guardian and custodian of the minor child, on 13.9.2019. This application was posted for hearing on 13.9.2019, on which date the Court issued notice to the appellant and his counsel. As per that order, the matter was again notified on 16.9.2019 when the counsel appearing for the appellant requested the Court to discharge him from the case, which request was acceded to by the Court. As a matter of fact, before discharging the counsel, the Family Court should have ensured that notice was given to the appellant about the request made by his counsel including to make alternative arrangements, if he so desired. Admittedly, no such notice was issued by the Family Court. Father dasti notice sent to the appellant was still awaited. The Family Court instead set down the main matter on 19.9.2019 at 2.30 p.m. In terms of order dated 16.9.2019, the Family Court additionally cancelled the already scheduled returnable date of 30.10.2019, unilaterally. There is nothing on record to show that the respondent had made such a request. Further before 19.9.2019, the respondent took out another application under O.I R.10 read with O.23 R.1A of the CPC for being transposed as petitioner in the guardianship petition and to transpose appellant as respondent therein, for the reasons stated in the application dated 18.9.2019. Admittedly, even copy of this application was not served on the appellant nor a formal notice came to be issued by the Family Court on this application, when it was taken up for hearing on 19.9.2019. Despite this the Family Court proceeded on assumption that the appellant abandoned the proceedings, disposed of the transposition application and declared the mother, respondent as sole, exclusive and absolute guardian and granted custody of minor child.\n\nHeld, the orders passed by the Family Court without notice to the appellant and without waiting for service of notice already issued on the former application. amounts to substantial non-compliance of the prescribed mandatory procedure and infraction of principles of natural justice, not a technical irregularity to be overlooked. The impugned judgment and orders of the Family Court came to be passed by the Family Court in a tearing hurry, may be because of the insistence of the respondent and her counsel to do so in light of the observations made by the High Court in habeas corpus and contempt matters against the appellant. The impugned judgment does make reference to those orders. Therefore the ex parte impugned judgment and orders dated 21.9.2019 passed by the Family Court on transposition application, as well as, on the application for declaration that the respondent mother is the sole, exclusive and absolute guardian and custodian of the minor child, liable to be set aside being illegal.

It is maintainable against a judgment. It is also maintainable against an order if it is not an interlocutory order.\n\n\tAs per the decision of the Supreme Court in Shah Babulal Khimji V/s Jayaben D.Kania [1981 SC 1786], an order and for that matter even an interlocutory order would be a 'judgment' if it has the quality of finality attached to it.\n\n\tWhat is noticeable in sub-section (1) of Section 19 of the Family Courts Act, 1984 is that it has deviated from Section 96 of the Code of Civil Procedure and from sub-section (1) of Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, in that, it provides for appeals against judgment. The Code of Civil Procedure does not provide for an appeal against judgments. It provides for an appeal against decrees and orders. Likewise Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 also does not provide for appeals against judgment. It provides for appeals against decrees and certain orders.\n\n\tAn order passed under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 though limited in its duration till the main proceedings are decided, is a final order. Indeed, the order would be a judgment because it decides matters of moment and which affects a valuable right of the parties. The expression 'some right or liability' is not restricted to the right in controversy in the main proceeding itself. It may be an order which is of an ancillary nature but is determinative of the rights and liabilities for the reason a spouse who is not able to maintain himself/herself without maintenance being awarded would be handicapped in litigating and per contra if the maintenance awarded is beyond the means of the other spouse and the spouse cannot pay the same the proceedings can be halted.\n\n\tThe reference is answered by holding that an appeal shall lie under Section 19(1) of the Family Courts Act, 1984 against an order passed by a Family Court under Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.\n\n2005(23) LCD 1, AIR 2010 Utr 67, 192 (2012) DLT 714, 1981 SC 1786 Ref. to.

                "description": "Appeal in matrimonial cases - Period of limitation - S.19(3) of Family Courts Act provides for limiting period of 30 days - Whereas by virtue of 2003 Amendment, limiting period in Hindu Marriage Act raised to 90 days - Held, limitation of 90 days would apply considering object of 2003 Amendment - No need to invoke non obstante provision under Family Courts Act as there is no direct conflict between two statutes.\n\nThe provisions of Section 28 (4) of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 came to be amended in the year 2003 consequent to the suggestion given by the Apex Court in Savitri Pandey's case [AIR 2002 SC 591]. Therefore, the purpose and object behind amending the said Act is required to be considered. While amending the provisions, the Parliament was aware of the existence of the provisions under Family Courts Act, 1984. It is presumed that the Parliament was conscious of the existence of another statute relating to the subject, prescribing forum and procedure and period of limitation. Therefore, a harmonious interpretation which would advance the object and purpose of the legislation will have to be adopted.\n\nAs the Act of 1955 was amended by the Parliament in the year 2003, in that sense, the period of limitation of ninety days was prescribed by a later law which would override the provisions relating to period of limitation prescribed in the earlier enactment i.e. Act of 1984. The substantive provision of law was amended at a later stage and the same shall prevail being later in point of time.\n\nEven if both the Acts are considered on certain subjects and situations to be special and general, even then, as a matter of sound interpretation and keeping in view the purpose for providing a larger period of limitation, it must be construed that the appeals arising out of the judgment and orders passed by the Family Court shall be governed by a larger period of limitation prescribed under Section 28(4) of the Act of 1955. Any contrary interpretation would frustrate the very object of the enactment which was made on the suggestion of the Apex Court in the case of Savitri Pandey.\n\nIt needs to be considered that we are a country of vast population, millions of people face financial hardship for litigating a matter, people have to spend considerable amount of time, money and energy. The geographical conditions further make easy access to justice difficult and taking into consideration all these circumstances, coupled with the peculiar situation faced by the parties while litigating matrimonial, family related issues, Apex Court made certain observations in the case of Savitri Pandey which suggestion was accepted by the Parliament and accordingly the law was amended.\n\nIf the two statutes are construed and understood in its proper sense, then there is no conflict between the two laws and, therefore, no question arises of invoking non obstante provision in Section 20 of the Act of 1984. The enactment of the Act of 1984 or non obstante provision in Section 20 is not intended to impliedly repeal provisions made in the Act of 1955. The Act of 1984 provides for a special forum relating to matrimonial disputes and with that view, special procedure was devised for expeditious adjudication of the cases. It is in that context the non obstante provision of Section 20 is required to be construed.\n\nIt would also not be appropriate to apply different period of limitation, one in case of orders passed by the Family Courts and in another by the regular Civil Courts. Such an approach would frustrate very purpose of legislation. For the reasons stated above, for an appeal filed under sub-section (1) of Section 19 of the Family Courts Act, 1984, period of limitation prescribed under sub-section (4) of Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 shall apply. 2002(3) ALL MR 250 (S.C.)

Under Section 28(4) of the Hindu Marriage Act the period of limitation is prescribed for orders passed under the Hindu Marriage Act. In this view of the matter, the stipulation of Section 19(3) are more general in nature inasmuch as they cover not only orders passed by the Family Court under the Hindu Marriage Act but cover all appealable orders passed in proceedings before the Family Court. The stipulations of Section 19(3) of the Family Courts Act being general in nature and Section 28(4) of the Hindu Marriage Act as amended being special in nature (in that they refer to one class of cases which fall under Section 19 of the Family Courts Act.) Stipulation of Section 28 of the Hindu Marriage Act in which the relevant sub-section (4) appears must be reckoned to be special more appropriate and specific, inasmuch as the said provision confers substantive right of appeal. Section 19(3) assumes a more general character. A substantive provision must get precedence over a procedural provision. The Hindu Marriage Act is the piece of substantive law which confers the power to pass the order in question and the right to prefer appeals. The Family Courts Act does not deal with substantive rights of the parties but only deals with the manner in which the matters coming within Section 7 of the Family Courts Act have to be dealt with and disposed of by the Family Courts. To this extent, it has to be held that the stipulations in the Hindu Marriage Act deal with substantive right of the parties and the substantive right of appeal whereas the stipulations in the Family Courts Act deal with procedural matters. On the principle that prominence and predominance must be given to the statutes dealing with substantive rights in preference to those dealing with procedural stipulations, the stipulation of the period of limitation in Section 28(4), must be preferred.

The very fact that the posts were to be filled up on regular basis by the competent authority clearly goes to show that the nature of appointment of the said persons was ad hoc one. Although on the expiry of six months, the services were allowed to continue but the same would not, in absence of any statutory interdict, mean that the ad hoc employee ceased to be so and acquired the status of a permanent or temporary employee. The scheme in terms of paragraph 3 is applicable to all regular employees in pensionable establishment, temporary or permanent who were in service. Thus, whether temporary or permanent, the employee must be regular employee which would mean employee appointed on a regular basis, i.e., in accordance with Rules. Only because services of ad hoc employees were continued, the same would not mean that thereby his status has been changed.

Since, an employee must be a Government employee at the first instance and he must be working in a pensionable scheme and should have completed a minimum period of one year of continuous service without break which would mean that he must be a temporary or permanent employee.

A person who holds himself out ready to give medical advice and treatment impliedly undertakes that he is possessed of skill and knowledge for the purpose. Such a person when consulted by a patient owes him certain duties, viz., a duty of care in deciding whether to undertake the case, a duty of care in deciding what treatment to give or a duty of care in the  administration of that treatment. A breach of any of those duties gives a right of action for negligence to the patient. The practitioner must bring to his task a reasonable degree of skill and knowledge and must exercise a reasonable degree of care. Neither the very highest nor a very low degree of care and competence judged in the light of the particular circumstances of each case is what the law requires: The doctor no doubt has a discretion in choosing treatment which he proposes to give to the patient and such discretion is relatively ampler in cases of emergency.   [Para 11]\n\nHeld High Court was not wrong in its conclusion that death was due to shock resulting from reduction of the fracture attempted by the appellant without taking the elementary caution of giving anaesthetic to the patient. The trial court and the High Court were, therefore, right in holding that the appellant was guilty of negligence and wrongful acts towards the patient and was liable for damages. \t  [Para 17]"

It might be possible, in a given case to contend, in terms of Sec.1A of the Fatal Accident Act, failure to bring the suit for the benefit of the wife also, is fatal to the suit. Yet, the insurer cannot take advantage of the same at appellate stage. The appeal memo of the insurer does not contain a specific challenge regarding maintainability of the suit or non-joinder of necessary parties.

The nature of the just claim  viz., compensation on account of the premature death of deceased on account of negligence cannot be defeated by exercising the discretion in favour of the tort-feasor.

The damages should be calculated with reference to a reasonable expectation of pecuniary benefit from the continuance of the life of the deceased. In an action under the Act, it is not sufficient for the plaintiff to prove that he lost by the death of the deceased a mere speculative possibility of pecuniary benefit. In order to succeed, it is necessary for him to show that he has lost a reasonable probability of pecuniary advantage. The mode of assessment of damages is not free from doubt. It is beset with certain difficulties. It depends on many imponderables. The English Courts have formulated certain basis for calculating damages under Lord Campbell's Acts.\n\nCompulsory damages under Section 1A of the Act for wrongful death must be limited strictly to the pecuniary loss to the beneficiaries and that under Section 2, the measure of damages is the economic loss sustained by the estate. There can be no exact uniform rule for measuring the value of the human life and the measure of damages cannot be arrived at by precise mathematical calculations but the amount recoverable depends on the particular facts and circumstances of each case. The life expectancy of the deceased or of the beneficiaries whichever is shorter is an important factor. Since the elements which go to make up the value of the life of the deceased to the designated beneficiaries are necessarily personal to each case, in the very nature of things, there can be no exact or uniform rule for measuring the value of human life. In assessing damages, the Court must exclude all considerations of matter which rest in speculation or fancy though conjecture to some extent is inevitable. In the instant cash deceased child was only 8 years old. As a general rule parents are entitled to recover cash value of prospective service of deceased minor child.\n(1862) 157 ER 34 and 448, 1913 AC 1, 1951 AC 601, (1962) 1 SCR 929 Ref. to.

Act being new and enlarged, cannot be hedged in by the limitations of Fatal Accidents Act.\n\nIt is true that Chapter VIII of the Act provides for an alternative forum for realisation of compensation payable on account of motor vehicles accidents but it is not correct to say that the said provisions in Chapter VIII of the Act are merely procedural. When the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855 was enacted there were no motor vehicles on the roads in India. Today, thousands of motor vehicles are put on the road and the largest number of injuries and deaths are taking place on the roads on account of the motor vehicles accidents. In order to meet to some extent the responsibility of society to the deaths and injuries caused in road accidents there has been a continuous agitation throughout the world to make the liability for damages arising out of motor vehicles accidents as a liability without fault. In order to meet the above social demand on the recommendation of the Indian Law Commission Chapter VIIA was introduced in the Act. Sections 92-A to 92-E of the Act are to be found in Chapter VIIA.\n\nTo a limited extent relief has been granted under S. 92-A of the Act to the legal representatives of the victims who have died on account of motor vehicles accidents. Now they can claim Rs. 15,000/- without proof of any negligence on the part of the owner of the vehicle or of any other person. This part of the Act is clearly a departure from the usual common law principle that a claimant should establish negligence on the part of the owner or driver of the motor vehicle before claiming any compensation for the death or permanent disablement caused on account of a motor vehicle accident. To that extent the substantive law of the country i.e. Fatal Accidents Act stands modified. The special provisions contained in S. 109-A to S. 109-C of the Act providing for a scheme for granting relief to victims or the legal representatives of victims of 'hit and run' motor vehicle accident cases is another novel effort on the part of the Government to remedy the situation created by the modern society which has been responsible for introducing to many fast moving vehicles on roads.\n\nWhile the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855 provides that such suit for compensation shall be for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent and child of the deceased, S. 110-A(l) of the M.V.  Act says that the application shall be made on behalf of or for the benefit of the legal representatives of the deceased. A legal representative in a given case need not necessarily be a wife, husband, parent and child. It is further seen from S. 110-B of the Act that the Claims Tribunal is authorised to make an award determining the amount of compensation which appears to it to be just and specifying the person or persons to whom compensation shall be paid. This provision takes the place of the third paragraph of S. 1A of the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855 which provides that in every such action, the Court may give such damages as it may think proportioned to the loss resulting from such death to the parties respectively, for whom and for whose benefit such action shall be brought. Persons for whose benefit such an application can be made and the manner in which the compensation awarded may be distributed amongst the persons for whose benefit the application is made are dealt with by S. 110-A and S. 110-B of the Act and to that extent the provisions of the Act do supersede the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855 in so far as motor vehicles accidents are concerned. \n\nThese provisions are not merely procedural provisions. They substantively affect the rights of the parties. As the right of action created by the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855 was \"new in its species, new in its quality, new in its principles, in every way new\" the right given to the legal representatives under the M.V. Act to file an application for compensation for death due to a motor vehicle accident is equally new and an enlarged one. This new right cannot be hedged in by all the limitations of an action under the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855. New situations and new dangers require new strategies and new remedies.       [Para 7,8,9]"

                "description": "Civil P.C. (1908), S.2(11) - Legal representative - Meaning of \"legal representative\" under M.V. Act is wider than what is contemplated under Fatal Accidents Act - A brother can maintain a petition claiming compensation under M.V. Act, though not under Fatal Accidents Act. \n\nThe expression 'legal representative' has not been defined in the Act. Section 2(11) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 defines 'legal representative' as a person who in law represents the estate of a deceased person and includes any person who intermeddles with the estate of the deceased and where a party sues or is sued in a representative character the person on whom the estate devolves on the death of the party so suing or sued. The above definition, no doubt, in terms does not apply to a case before the Claims Tribunal but it has to be stated that even in ordinary parlance the said expression is understood almost in the same way in which it is defined in the Code of Civil Procedure. A legal representative ordinarily means a person who in law represents the estate of a deceased person or a person on whom the estate devolves on the death of an individual.\n\nSection 110-A(l) of the M.V. Act thus expressly states that (i) an application for compensation may be made by the legal representatives of the deceased or their agent and (ii) that such application shall be made on behalf of or for the benefit of all the legal representatives. Both the person or persons who can make an application for compensation and the persons for whose benefit such application can be made are thus indicated in S. 110-A of the Act. This section in a way is a substitute to an  extent for the provisions of S. 1A of the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855 which provides that \"every such action or suit shall be for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent and child, if any, of the person whose death shall have been so caused, and shall be brought by and in the name of the executor, administrator or representative of the person deceased.\" While the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855 provides that such suit shall be for the benefit of the wife, husband, parent and child of the deceased, S. 110-A(l) of the M.V. Act says that the application shall be made on behalf of or for the benefit of the legal representatives of the deceased. A legal representative in a given case need not necessarily be a wife, husband, parent and child.\n\nEvery legal representative who suffers on account of the death of a person due to a motor vehicle accident should have a remedy for realisation of compensation and that is provided by S. 110- A to 110-F of the Act. These provisions are in consonance with the principles of law of torts that every injury must have a remedy. It is for the Motor Vehicles Accidents Tribunal to determine the compensation which appears to it to be just as provided in S. 110-B of the Act to specify the person or persons to whom compensation shall be paid. The determination of the compensation payable and its apportionment as required by S. 110-B of the Act amongst the legal representatives for whose benefit an application may be filed under S. 110-A of the Act have to be done in accordance with well-known principles of law. We should remember that in an Indian family brothers, sisters and brothers' children and sometimes foster children live together and they are dependent upon the bread-winner of the family and if the bread-winner is killed on account of a motor vehicle accident, there is no justification to deny them compensation relying upon the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855 which has been substantially modified by the provisions contained in the M.V. Act in relation to cases arising out of motor vehicles accidents. Brother of a person who dies in a motor vehicle accident is entitled to maintain a petition under S. 110-A of the M.V. Act if he is a legal representative of the deceased.\n\nAIR 1981 M.P. 151 Overruled.\nAIR 1977 Guj. 195 Approved. [Para 9,11]"

To satisfy the test of permissible classification, it must not be \"arbitrary, artificial or evasive\" but must be based on some real and substantial distinction bearing a just and reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved by the Legislature. The taxation laws are no exception to the application of this principle of equality enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution of India. However, the Legislature enjoys very wide latitude in the matter of classification of objects, persons and things for the purpose of taxation in view of inherent complexity of fiscal adjustment of diverse elements. The power of the Legislature to classify is of wide range and flexibility so that it can adjust its system of taxation in all proper and reasonable ways. Even so, large latitude is allowed to the State for classification upon a reasonable basis and what is reasonable is a question of practical details and a variety of factors which the Court will be reluctant and perhaps illequipped to investigate. A taxation Statute, for the reasons of functional expediency and even otherwise, can pick and choose to tax some. A power to classify being extremely broad and based on diverse considerations of executive pragmatism, the Judicature cannot rush in where even the Legislature warily treads. All these operational restraints on judicial power must weigh more emphatically where the subject is taxation. Discrimination resulting from fortuitous circumstances arising out of particular situations, in which some of the tax payers find themselves, is not hit by Article 14 if the legislation, as such, is of general application and does not single them out for harsh treatment. Advantages or disadvantages to individual assesses are accidental and inevitable and are inherent in every taxing Statute as it has to draw a line somewhere and some cases necessarily fall on the other side of the line. (2010) 6 SCC 705, (2007) 6 SCC 624, (2002)1 SCC 557, (1999) 7 SCC 400, (1993) 3 SCC 677, (1991) 2 SCC 154 Rel.on. \t\t\t\t\t\t    [Para 45]\n\nKar Vivad Samadhan Scheme is a step towards the settlement of outstanding disputed tax liability. The Scheme is a complete Code in itself and exhaustive of matter dealt with therein. Therefore, the courts must construe the provisions of the Scheme with reference to the language used therein and ascertain what their true scope is by applying the normal rule of construction. \t\t \t    [Para 29]\n\nThe tests adopted to determine whether a classification is reasonable or not, are, that the classification must be founded on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes person or things that are grouped together from others left out of the groups and that the differentia must have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by Statute in question. The Legislature in relation to 'tax arrears' has classified two groups of assessees. The first one being those assessees in whose cases duty is quantified and not paid as on the 31st day of March, 1998 and those assessees who are served with Demand or Show Cause Notice issued on or before the 31st day of March, 1998. The Scheme is not made applicable to such of those assessees whose duty dues are quantified but Demand Notice is not issued as on 31st day of March, 1998 intimating the assessee's dues payable. The same is the case of the assessees who are not issued with the Demand or Show Cause Notice as on 31.03.1998. The grievance of the assessee is that the date fixed is arbitrary and deprives the benefit for those assessees who are issued Demand Notice or Show Cause Notice after the cut off date namely 31st day of March, 1998. In determining whether classification is reasonable, regard must be had to the purpose for which legislation is designed. While understanding the Scheme of the legislation, the legislation is based on a reasonable basis which is firstly, the amount of duties, cesses, interest, fine or penalty must have been determined as on 31.03.1998 but not paid as on the date of declaration and secondly, the date of issuance of Demand or Show Cause Notice on or before 31.03.1998, which is not disputed but the duties remain unpaid on the date of filing of declaration. Therefore, the Scheme 1998 does not violate the equal protection clause where there is an essential difference and a real basis for the classification which is made. The mere fact that the line dividing the classes is placed at one point rather than another will not impair the validity of the classification. \t\t\t   [Para 30]"

Scheme - CBI, however, initiated criminal proceedings under IPC against GCS for cheating Government by evading duty and obtaining customs duty exemption certificate by concealment of facts - Held, criminal liability stood compounded on settlement under K.V.S. Scheme and initiation of criminal proceedings amounted to double jeopardy.\n\nThe GCS is immuned from any criminal proceedings pursuant to the certificates issued under the said Scheme and the appellants are being prosecuted in their capacity as office bearers of the GCS. As the Customs duty has already been paid, the Central Government has not suffered any financial loss. Moreover, as per the Kar Vivad Samadhan Scheme, 1998 whoever is granted the benefit under the said Scheme is granted immunity from prosecution from any offence under the Customs Act, 1962 including the offence of evasion of duty. In the circumstances, the complaint filed against the appellants is unsustainable.  [Para 29]\n\nIn the present case, the alleged criminal liability stands compounded on a settlement with respect to the civil issues and, therefore, the First Information Report was erroneously issued and was totally unwarranted. The Kar Vivad Samadhan Scheme, 1998 issued by the Government of India was a voluntary Scheme whereby if the disputed demand is settled by the Authority and pending proceedings are withdrawn by an importer, the balance demand against an importer shall be dropped and the importer shall be immuned from penal proceedings under any law in force. The learned single Judge of the High Court of Delhi, has not appreciated the fact that the continuance of the proceedings in the instant case would only tantamount to driving the present appellants to double jeopardy when they had been honourably exonerated by the Collector of Customs by their adjudication and further the GCS of which one of the appellants is the General Secretary in which capacity he is accused in the present case was granted amnesty under the Kar Vivad Samadhan Scheme, 1998. The present case does not warrant subjecting a citizen especially senior citizens of the age of 92 and 70 years to fresh investigation and prosecution on an incident or fact situation giving rise to offence under both the Customs Act and the Indian Penal Code when the matter has already been settled.  [Para 34]\n\nUnder the penal law, there is no concept of vicarious liability unless the said statute covers the same within its ambit. In the instant case, the said law which prevails in the field i.e. the Customs Act, 1962 the appellants have been therein under wholly discharged and the GCS granted immunity from prosecution. It is well established principle of law that the matter which has been adjudicated and settled need not to be dragged into the Criminal Courts unless and until the act of the appellants could have been described as culpable. The true fact and import of the Kar Vivad Samadhan Scheme, 1998, is that once the said Scheme is availed of and all the formalities complied with including the payment of the duty, the immunity granted under the provisions of the Customs Act, 1962 also extends to such offences that may prima facie be made out on identical allegations i.e. of evasion of customs duty and violation of any Notification issued under the said Act.\t\t\t [Para 35]"

The impugned tax is levied on these services as taxable services. It is not a tax on material or sale. The taxable event is rendition of service. Hence, the impugned tax is different and distinct from tax on sale of goods under Entry 54 List II of the VIIth Schedule to the Constitution.\t\t\t\t\t [Para 19,40]\n\nThe financial transaction was earlier out of the tax net. In the process there are two different and distinct transactions, viz., the financing transaction and the equipment leasing/hire-purchase transaction.

Funding or financing the transaction of equipment leasing and hire-purchase covers two different and distinct transactions. The Non-banking Financial Companies (NBFC) essentially are loan companies.

                "description": "Tax on land and buildings - Service Tax on renting of immoveable property is not unconstitutional - It is valid and within purview of the field set apart for Parliament - Constitution of India, VII Schedule List II, Entry 49. \n\n A tax on land and buildings within the meaning of Entry 49 of List II is a tax which is directly imposed on land or buildings. Such a tax is a tax which is on the general ownership of the land. The service tax that has been legislated upon by Parliament is not a tax on land. The true nature and character of the levy is not a tax on land or buildings. The charge of tax is a taxable service which Parliament regards as being rendered. The renting of immovable property is an activity which in the legislative wisdom of Parliament involves a conferment of service and it is in that legislative exercise that Parliament has proceeded to impose a levy of service tax. The measure of tax under Section 67 is the gross amount charged by the service provider for the service which is provided or which is to be provided by him. In the case of renting of immovable property, the measure is the rental. The measure of the tax does by no means indicate that the tax is a tax imposed on land or buildings.  [Para 26]\n\nTherefore, looked at from either stand point, the legislative basis that has been adopted by Parliament in subjecting taxable services involved in the renting of property to the charge of service tax cannot be questioned. The assumption by a legislative body that an element of service is involved in the renting of immovable property is certainly not an assumption which can be regarded by the Court as being so manifestly absurd or perverse as to lead to an inference that Parliament had treated as a service, an item which in no rational sense could be regarded as involving service. But more significantly, even if the Court were to proceed on the basis, suggested by the Petitioners that no element of service is involved, that would not make the legislation beyond the legislative competence of Parliament. So long as the legislation does not trench upon a field which has been reserved to the State legislatures, the only conclusion that can be drawn is that the law must be treated as valid and within the purview of the field set apart for Parliament. There is, it must be emphasised, no violation set up of any provision in Part III of the Constitution.  [Para 33]"

                "description": "Service tax - In respect of legal services availed by business entities - Constitutional validity of amendment brought by Finance Act, 2011 - By impugned amendment, tax liability shifted from advocates to recipient of service i.e. corporate sector - Poor and needy individuals already exempted from tax liability - Classification of tax payers, reasonable - It has definite nexus with object sought to be achieved - It can neither be called as arbitrary violating Art.14 nor can it be said to be taking away right guaranteed under Art.19(1)(g) to carry on legal profession - In any case, advocates are not affected by such provisions.\n\nThe legislature by inserting such provision has neither interfered with the role and function of an advocate nor has it made any inroad and interference in the constitutional guarantee of justice to all. The services provided to a individual client by a individual advocate continues to be exempted from the purview of the Finance Act and consequently Service Tax but when an individual advocate provides service or agrees to provide services to any business entity located in the taxable territory, then, he is included and liable to pay Service Tax. That is because the legislature was aware that poor and needy section of the population requires advice, consultancy or assistance in any branch of law, if he requires legal advice, aid and assistance, then, that should be available to him at times immediately and cheaply. He should not be burdened with a tax to be levied on the advocate for providing such services. Therefore, if the legislature thought it fit to exclude a individual advocate and rendering the above services to individuals, so long as he is rendering services to those who cannot afford to pay heavy professional fees and charges being individuals that the legislature deemed it fit not to include in the tax bracket the individual advocates. These advocates may be rendering services to the needy and specially women and children at Village, Taluka, District, Town and even at city levels. It is, therefore, apparent to us that the legislature while making the above distinction did not in any manner overlook the constitutional guarantee and as envisaged in the preamble to the Constitution of India., so also Article 21 and 39A thereof, the legislature made a distinction and which appears to us to be completely reasonable. The classification between those who can afford professional legal services and are ready to pay the fees or charges demanded without seeking any reduction or concession and those who cannot pay legal fees but can at best bear meagre expenses has been made. This classification has a reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved.   [Para 41]\n\nIt is when services are rendered to such entities and persons by not individual advocates but those working on business lines, then, if they are brought within the net of taxable services and service tax is levied on them, they can hardly complain. Their right to carry on legal profession and as per their choice can hardly be said to be taken away much less adversely affected. \t [Para 41]\n\nThe classification between service provided to business entities and individuals, therefore, cannot be said to be illusory. The classification has a definite nexus and with the object sought to be achieved. If that is to explore and expand the sources of revenue and by widening the tax net, then, it is achieved by bringing within the fold the aforementioned services. There is, therefore, no violation of the constitutional mandate. The classification cannot be termed as arbitrary, discriminatory, unfair, unreasonable and unjust. \t [Para 50]"

A paramount duty is cast on the States and its authorities to achieve an appropriate level of protection to human life and health which is a fundamental right guaranteed to the citizens under Article 21 read with Article 47 of the Constitution of India.\n\nEnjoyment of life and its attainment, including right to life and human dignity encompasses, within its ambit availability of articles of food, without insecticides or pesticides residues, veterinary drugs residues, antibiotic residues, solvent residues, etc. But the fact remains, many of the food articles like rice, vegetables, meat, fish, milk, fruits available in the market contain insecticides or pesticides residues, beyond the tolerable limits, causing serious health hazards. fruit based soft drinks available in various fruit stalls, contain such pesticides residues in alarming proportion, but no attention is made to examine its contents. Children and infants are uniquely susceptible to the effects of pesticides because of their physiological immaturity and greater exposure to soft drinks, fruit based or otherwise.\n\nIt is, therefore, of utmost importance that the provisions of the Acts are properly and effectively implemented so that the State can achieve an appropriate level of human life and health, safeguarding the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. \t\t\t\t     [Para 21,23,25]"

Section 18(2)(a) requires that the Food Authority shall, while framing regulations and specifying standards under the Act, ensure prevention of unsafe or contaminated or sub-standard food. It is, thus, clear that the authorities entrusted with the duty of implementing the Food Safety Act, 2006 are not merely to perform the negative duty of preventing food adulteration, but are required to play a very pro-active role for ensuring safe and wholesome food and to prevent and eliminate risk to health caused by unsafe food. It is, therefore, clear that Food Safety and Standards Act, 2006 is the comprehensive single special legislation for all food products on the subject of safety and standards.            [Para 18,24]\n\nThe Food Authority of India has made with the previous approval of the Central Government and after previous publication, the 2011 regulations including regulations 2.3.4, 3.1.7 and 2.11.5. The Food Safety Commissioner in the State of Maharashtra noticed that 98% out of more than 1000 samples collected during the last seven years contained tobacco, nicotine or magnesium carbonate which are injurious to health and that the Food Authority of India had by statutory Regulations of 2011 already banned the manufacture of any product containing tobacco, nicotine or magnesium carbonate (excluding specific product like salt powder which could have upto 2% magnesium carbonate). The Food Safety Commissioner, State of Maharashtra was, thus, acting well within his powers to ensure that manufacturers, distributors and sellers of gutka and pan masala shall not be allowed to contravene the statutory provisions contained in 2011 Regulations, such as Regulation 2.3.4, 3.1.7 and 2.11.5.                 [Para 30]\n\nHaving examined the scheme of PFA Act, 1954, Cigarettes Act, 2003 and the Food Safety Act, 2006 and 2011 Regulations framed thereunder, which were laid before Parliament and not modified and having regard to the fact that Food Safety Act, 2006 is a later Act and a comprehensive legislation on food safety and contains a non-obstante clause in section 89 thereof, the field of safety and standards of food (which includes gutka, pan masala and supari) the Food Safety Act, 2006 occupies the entire field.

Thus, any Notification issued by the Commissioner of Food Safety, is directly relatable to the exercise of the powers under the FSSA and is not an independent power exercised by the State by enacting / passing any law/legislation in respect of the subjects in Entry-26 List II or Entry- 33 List III of the seventh schedule to the constitution. The domain or jurisdiction of commissioner of food safety is within the State and thus the impugned order dated 15- 7-2020 prohibiting transportation of banned products such as tobacco, pan masala etc. from one State to another through state of Maharashtra will have to be read as not creating or imposing any ban on any inter- State transport of goods. This would however not mean that the Authorities, empowered to enforce the prohibition as contained in the Order dated 15/7/2020, would in any way, be restrained from ensuring that the prohibition as imposed, is enforced. (Paras 21, 22, 40)\n\tIn the instant Case the place of origin of goods is in State of Gujarat. The destination is within the State of Odisha. The truck carrying banned articles detained in washim district of Maharashtra which is not even on National Highway. It would naturally raise a presumption that the goods may have been destined to be offloaded some place in Maharashtra, though the destination on paper be otherwise. Though inter-State transport would be permissible, the State Authorities would be within their rights, to seize the goods, which are prohibited within the State, so as to ensure that they are not offloaded in the State under the guise of inter-State transport, with a view to enforce the prohibition within the State and curb black marketing of such goods within the State. Nothing prevents the transporters to plan a route, which avoids the State where the goods are prohibited. An alternate route, at the most, may increase the cost of transportation, but would save them from the clutches of prohibition. Thus, there is no illegality in the seizure of the vehicles, carrying the prohibited goods, which was way off the easiest route of transport. (Paras 23, 40)\n\tInstead of using the easier and shortest route from the point of origin to the point of destination, the use of a circuitous route, would entitle the authorities to draw an adverse inference, that the goods were intended for sale within the State, through which they were being transported and the case was not that of an inter-State transport.

It is also axiomatic that any report as to any health risk, as defined in Section 3 (zm) of the FSSA as contemplated by Section 34 (1) of the FSSA by the Designated Officer, would be restricted to the District for which such Officer is appointed and not for the entire State. It would be further material to note that the impugned order dated 15/7/2020, nowhere indicates that the same has been passed, based upon any report by the Designated Officer.

It is only in the presence of two aforesaid ingredients, the section gets attracted and in the absence of any 'administration' to another or the accused 'causing' any person to take the substance, person cannot be made liable for an offence under Section 328 of the IPC. The act of storage which is alleged against the Petitioners fall short of the ingredients of Section 328 of the IPC. Mere storage without any further action and on a contemplation that it would be sold in the market, brought by a person from the market and consumed by him is too far fetched consequence of an act of 'administering' or 'causing to be taken'.\n\n\tMere storage cannot even be construed as an attempt to commit an offence under Section 328 of the IPC since an act would become an attempt only on a positive act being committed by a person which would have resulted in commission of offence. However, the unforeseen act beyond the control of the accused, can only be an attempt.

It cannot be denied that members of club also fall within the ambit of the term 'public'. No doubt, the primary activity of the club is to provide sporting facilities to the members, but the supply of food is an integral part of such activity and the catering department of the club satisfies an essential component of the facilities provided by the club. One can take judicial notice of the fact that many members who avail sporting facilities remain on the premises for a very long period. Therefore, the articles of food become integral part of their activities. Not only this, many join the club in the name of availing sporting facilities only for the purpose of spending their time in leisure and for enjoying the facilities provided by the Catering Department of the club. Thus, even though profit may not be the motto of catering facilities provided by the club it certainly gains by these facilities. The word 'gain' in S.3(ff) is not synonymous with the word 'profit'. It is not restricted to pecuniary or commercial profits and includes other considerations of value gained. Any advantage or benefit acquired or value addition made by some activities would amount to 'gain'. Therefore, even though profit is not the motto of the club but the advantage derived by it by supplying food to its members and their guests is certainly covered by the word 'gain' appearing in the definition of 'eating house'.

Income Tax Act (1961), S. 269 UA (b) (1) (ii) Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (1973), Ss. 19, 29, 47.\n\nAs a larger settlement between the parties a flat worth millions of rupees already standing in the name of Petitioners Nos 1 & 2 and Respondent Nos 1 & 2 was settled on Petition Nos 1 & 2 and names of Respondents Nos 1 & 2 were to be deleted. Held it was not possible to accept that any exchange as such took place between the parties. Nothing specific was transferred for consideration. There was no surrender of interest for consideration in the flat. There was no question of black money being generated. Even assuming that it amounted to transfer, the passing of the judgment in terms of the award would not be against the public policy of Chapter XXC of the Income Tax Act. The award is passed and the judgment can be given in view of S.6(1) of the Act. Even the decree following under S.6(2) can be made subject to the interested party following the procedure under Chapter XXC of the Income Tax Act.\n\n'Public Policy' is a vague term and it is necessary to invoke it only in clear and incontestable cases of harm to the public. The Court should be anxious in not defeating the foreign award by finding out some defect and then equating it with the public policy of the country. The enforcement should not be denied on this spacious ground because the award is not acceptable to the party against whom enforcement is sought, otherwise this would be defeating the very object of New York Convention 1958 and Act of 1961. AIR  1986 SC 1370, AIR 1994 SC 860, AIR 1986 SC 156  Relied on.  [Para 23]\n\nForeign award involves two aspects - recognition and enforcement. Enforcement of the judgment i.e. decree can be made subject to obtaining necessary permission under the Act. It is not necessary that prior permission ought to have been obtained as neither Section 29 nor Section 19 of Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, uses the phrase 'prior permission'. In view of Section 47(2) and (3) the responsibility of obtaining the permission of Reserve Bank of India before enforcement of the judgment or the decree  would be upon the Petitioners.  [Para 25]"

                "description": "\"Public policy\" - Award contrary to \"fundamental policy of Indian Law\", \"The interest of India\" and \"justice or morality\", would be set aside as being contrary to public policy of India.\n\nThe violation of the Foreign Exchange Act and disregarding orders of superior courts in India would be regarded as being contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law. To this it could be added that the binding effect of the judgment of a superior court being disregarded would be equally violative of the fundamental policy of Indian law. The juristic principle of a \"judicial approach\" demands that a decision be fair, reasonable and objective. On the obverse side, anything arbitrary and whimsical would obviously not be a determination which would either be fair, reasonable or objective.\n\n The Audi Alteram Partem principle which undoubtedly is a fundamental juristic principle in Indian law is also contained in Sections 18 and 34 (2) (a) (iii) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. The third juristic principle is that a decision which is perverse or so irrational that no reasonable person would have arrived at the same is important and requires some degree of explanation. It is settled law that where-\n\n1.  a finding is based on no evidence, or\n\n2.  an arbitral tribunal takes into account something irrelevant to the decision which it arrives at; or\n\n3.  ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision, such decision would necessarily be perverse.\n\nWhen a court is applying the \"public policy\" test to an arbitration award, it does not act as a court of appeal and consequently errors of fact cannot be corrected. A possible view by the arbitrator on facts has necessarily to pass muster as the arbitrator is the ultimate master of the quantity and quality of evidence to be relied upon when he delivers his arbitral award. Thus an award based on little evidence or on evidence which does not measure up in quality to a trained legal mind would not be held to be invalid on this score. Once it is found that the arbitrators approach is not arbitrary or capricious, then he is the last word on facts.\n\n The next ground on which an award may be set aside is that it is contrary to the interest of India. Obviously, this concerns itself with India as a member of the world community in its relations with foreign powers. As at present advised, we need not dilate on this aspect as this ground may need to evolve on a case by case basis.\n\n An award can be said to be against justice only when it shocks the conscience of the court. An illustration of this can be given. A claimant is content with restricting his claim, let us say to Rs. 30 lakhs in a statement of claim before the arbitrator and at no point does he seek to claim anything more. The arbitral award ultimately awards him 45 lakhs without any acceptable reason or justification. Obviously, this would shock the conscience of the court and the arbitral award would be liable to be set aside on the ground that it is contrary to \"justice\". \n\n The other ground is of \"morality.\" Apex court has confined morality to sexual morality so far as section 23 of the Contract Act is concerned, which in the context of an arbitral award would mean the enforcement of an award say for specific performance of a contract involving prostitution. \"Morality\" would, if it is to go beyond sexual morality necessarily cover such agreements as are not illegal but would not be enforced given the prevailing mores of the day. However, interference on this ground would also be only if something shocks the court's conscience.\n\n The \"patent illegality principle contains three sub-heads viz. \n\n(a)  a contravention of the substantive law of India would result in the death knell of an arbitral award. This must be understood in the sense that such illegality must go to the root of the matter and cannot be of a trivial nature. This again is really a contravention of Section 28(1)(a) of the Act, \n\n(b)  a contravention of the Arbitration Act itself would be regarded as a patent illegality- for example if an arbitrator gives no reasons for an award in contravention of section 31(3) of the Act, such award will be liable to be set aside.\n\n(c)  Equally, the third sub-head of patent illegality is really a contravention of Section 28 (3) of the Arbitration Act. \n\nThis last contravention must be understood with a caveat. An arbitral tribunal must decide in accordance with the terms of the contract, but if an arbitrator construes a term of the contract in a reasonable manner, it will not mean that the award can be set aside on this ground. Construction of the terms of a contract is primarily for an arbitrator to decide unless the arbitrator construes the contract in such a way that it could be said to be something that no fair minded or reasonable person could do.

Where the goods are freely importable, the imported goods purchased from the acquired foreign exchange may be sold in high sea sale basis and the person who purchased the goods on high sea sale basis can seek clearance of the said goods.  In such a case, it cannot be said that the goods purchased have not been brought into India, merely because the goods are not cleared by the person acquiring the foreign exchange.

In the present case, there is no dispute that the proceedings under FERA were initiated within the stipulated time and that the petitioners have a substantive right of filing an appeal against the adjudication orders passed under FERA. However, the dispute is whether such appeals are maintainable before the Special Director (Appeals) or before the Appellate Tribunal constituted under FEMA. Admittedly, there was one appellate forum provided under FERA against the orders passed by the Adjudicating Authorities under FERA. However, under FEMA, the legislature has provided for two appellate forum against the orders of the Adjudicating Authorities under FEMA. In view of the dissolution of the Appellate Board constituted under FERA, as per Section 49 of FEMA, appeals against the orders passed by the Adjudicating Authorities under FERA have to be instituted before the corresponding appellate forum constituted under FEMA. Section 17(1) of FEMA empowers the Central Government to appoint one or more Special Director (Appeals) to hear appeals against the orders of the Adjudicating Authorities set out in that section. The words 'Adjudicating Authorities under this Section' in Section 17(1) clearly signifies that the powers of Special Director (Appeals) are restricted to the appeals against the orders passed by the Adjudicating Authorities specified in that section. Section 17(2) of FEMA specifically provides that appeals against orders of the Adjudicating Authority, such as Assistant Director / Deputy Director of Enforcement would be maintainable before the Special Director (Appeals) appointed under Section 17(1). Thus, the powers of the Special Director (Appeals) appointed under Section 17(1) is restricted to hear appeals against the orders of the Adjudicating Authority such as Assistant Director /Deputy Director of Enforcement.

Reasons for the same set out in detail hereinbelow.\t [Para 22]\n\n\tFirst, if the Adjudicating Officer had passed an order under Section 51 of FERA prior to 01.06.2000, then the appeal against such order was required to be filed before the Appellate Board under Section 52 (2) of FERA. In other words, if the Adjudicating Officer had passed the order under Section 51 of FERA prior to 01.06.2000 when FERA was in force, the appeal against such order was maintainable only under Section 52 (2) before the Appellate Board under FERA.\t\t\t\t [Para 23]\n\n\tSecond, if such appeal had remained pending before the Appellate Board on 01.06.2000, the same would have been transferred to Appellate Tribunal constituted under FEMA in terms of Section 49 (5)(b) of FEMA for its disposal.\t [Para 24]\n\n\tThird, a fortiori, any appeal, if filed after 01.06.2000 and against the similar order, i.e., an order passed under Section 51 of FERA should also be held to lie before the Appellate Tribunal under Section 19 of FEMA alike the appeals filed prior to 01.06.2000 and which were transferred to the Appellate Tribunal by virtue of Section 49(5)(b) of FEMA.\t\t [Para 26]\n\n\tFourth, the reason behind this simultaneous statutory transfer of pending appeals to the Appellate Tribunal under FEMA appears to be that the legislature did not intend to provide two separate Appellate Authorities under FEMA for challenging the adjudication order passed under Section 51 of the FERA, i.e., one appeal before the Special Director (Appeals) and the other appeal before the Appellate Tribunal under FEMA.\t [Para 27]\n\n\tIn other words, the legislature did not intend to make a distinction between the two appeals for their disposal by two different appellate authorities under FEMA only because one appeal was filed prior to 01.06.2000, therefore, it will lie before the Appellate Tribunal whereas the other appeal which was filed after 01.06.2000 though against the similar order, it will lie before the Special Director (Appeals). There does not appear to be any justifiable reason to make such distinction for filing of appeals filed against the similar order passed under FERA before two different appellate authorities under FEMA.\t [Para 28]\n\n\tSo far as Section 81(c) of FERA, 1973 is concerned, it deals with Repeal and Saving of FERA, 1947. Clause (c) of Section 81 specifically provides that all the appeals filed under Section 23 of FERA, 1947, whether pending on the date of Repeal or/and those filed after the repeal of FERA, 1947, shall be disposed of by the Appellate Board constituted under FERA, 1973.\t [Para 31]\n\n\tIt is true that Section 49 (5)(b) of FEMA is not worded alike Section 81 (c) of FERA, yet, it shows the intention of the legislature that all such appeals have to be heard by the Appellate Board under the FERA. \t\t\t [Para 32]\n\n\tThere is no reason as to why the same legislative intent while interpreting the provisions of FERA, 1973 and FEMA, 1999 is applied for deciding the identical question now arising in the case.\t [Para 36]\n\n\tApplying the principle of purposive interpretation, held that appellate forum for deciding the appeals arising out of the order passed under Section 51 of FERA whether filed prior to 01.06.2000 or filed after 01.06.2000 must be the same, i.e., Appellate Tribunal under FEMA.\t [Para 40]"

                "description": "Application of S.14 - Appellant can seek exclusion of time under S.14 of Limitation Act - S.35 of FEMA, held, does not exclude application of S.14 of Limitation Act.\n\nSection 29(2) of the Limitation Act, 1963 prescribes that where any special or local law prescribes for any suit, appeal or application, a period of limitation different from the time prescribed by the Schedule, the provisions of Section 3 shall apply as if such period were the period prescribed by the Schedule and for the purposes of determining the period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by any special or local law, the provisions contained in Sections 4 to 24 shall apply only in so far as, and to the extent to which, they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law. Now Section 35 of the FEMA provides firstly, a specific period of limitation of sixty days for filing an Appeal before the High Court. Secondly, Section 35 empowers the High Court to allow the Appeal to be filed within a further period not exceeding sixty days if it is satisfied that the Appellant was prevented by a sufficient cause from filing the Appeal within the original period of sixty days. In view of this provision, section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 would not empower the High Court to condone the delay for a period in excess of what is stipulated by the proviso to Section 35. Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963, however, does not provide for an extension of the period of limitation. Section 14 deals with the exclusion of time taken in a proceeding bona fide in a Court without jurisdiction. Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 does not extend the period of limitation but relates to the exclusion of a certain period while computing the period of limitation. Undoubtedly the provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 would stand excluded and the power of the High Court to condone a delay occasioned beyond the period specified by the proviso to Section 35 would be excluded by virtue of the specific statutory provision. But merely because the provision of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 are rendered inapplicable that would not result in an inference that the provisions of Section 14 would not apply. That is simply because Section 14 is not a provision which confers upon the Court a power to condone the delay for sufficient cause but a provision by which a certain period has to be excluded in computing the period of limitation. Hence, there is absolutely no reason or justification for the Court to infer that Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 cannot be applied in relation to the proceedings before the High Court in an Appeal under Section 35 of the FEMA. Section 35 of the FEMA does not in any event expressly exclude the application of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963.\n\n\n2008(6) ALL MR 423 (S.C.) Rel.on.  [Para 7]"

On a combined reading of Section 49 of FEMA and Section 6 of General Clauses Act, it is clear that the procedure prescribed by FEMA only would be applicable in respect of an appeal filed under FEMA though cause of action arose under FERA. In fact, the time limit prescribed under FERA was taken away under the proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 19 and the Tribunal has been conferred with wide powers to condone delay if the appeal is not filed within forty-five days prescribed, provided sufficient cause is shown. Therefore, the findings rendered by the Tribunal as well as the High Court that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to condone the delay beyond the date prescribed under FERA is not a correct understanding of the law on the subject. [Para 28]\n\nSection 52(2) can apply only to an appeal to the appellate Board and not to any appellate tribunal. Therefore, irrespective of the fact that the adjudicating officer had passed the orders with reference to the violation of the provisions of FERA, as the appeal against such order was to the appellate tribunal constituted under FEMA, necessarily Section 19(2) of FEMA alone will apply and it is not possible to import the provisions of Section 52(2) of FERA. As we are not concerned with the appeals to Appellate Board, but appeals to the Appellate Tribunal, limitation being a matter of procedure, only that law that is applicable at the time of filing the appeal, would apply. Therefore, Section 19(2) of FEMA and not Section 52(2) of FERA will apply. As noticed above, under Section 19(2), there is no ceiling in regard to the period of delay that could be condoned by the appellate tribunal. If sufficient cause is made out, delay beyond 45 days can also be condoned. The tribunal and the High Court misdirected themselves in assuming that the period of limitation was governed by Section 52(2) of FERA.  \t\t\t [Para 26]\n\nIf the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing an appeal in time, the appellate authority under FERA could not condone the delay beyond 45 days whereas under FEMA, if the sufficient cause is made out, the delay can be condoned without any limit. Any provision relating to limitation is always regarded as procedural and in the absence of any provision to the contrary, the law in force on the date of the institution of the appeal, irrespective of the date of accrual of the cause of action for the original order, will govern the period of limitation.   [Para 25]\n\nSection 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 which protects the rights, obligations and actions and liabilities applies in spite of repeal of FERA subject to two years limitation period specified in sub-section (3) of Section 49 for initiation of proceedings. Therefore, in view of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act read with sub-section (3) of Section 49 of FEMA, proceedings for violation of FERA can be instituted within the sunset period of two years with effect from 1.6.2000 till 31.5.2002. But for sub-section(3) there will be no limitation period of two years in view of Section 6 of General Clauses Act, 1897 read with sub-section (4) of Section 49 of FEMA.   [Para 23]"

                "description": "Interpretation of statute - Words \"take notice\" in S.49(3) of FEMA - It is referable to prima facie opinion formed before issuance of the first notice under R.3(1) of the Appeal Rules - Held, unless adjudicating officer forms a prima facie opinion that provisions of FERA have been violated, he cannot issue a show cause notice calling upon the noticee to show cause as to why adjudication proceedings should not be held for the alleged contravention of FEFA.\n\nSince FERA is repealed with effect from 01/06/2000, no proceedings under FERA can be initiated for the alleged contravention of FERA after 01/06/2000. However, Section 49(3) of FEMA provides that the adjudicating officer can initiate proceedings under FEMA in respect  of the alleged contravention of FERA provided the adjudicating officer takes notice of the said contravention on or before 31/05/2002.  In the present case, on the basis of the materials placed by the enforcement officer, the adjudicating officer formed a prima facie opinion that the petitioners have contravened the provisions of FERA and decided to issue a show-cause notice to the petitioners under Rule 3(1) of the Appeal Rules. It is not in dispute that the show-cause notice was in fact prepared and signed by the adjudicating officer on  31-5-2002. The question is, whether signing of the show-cause notice amounts to taking notice under Section 49(3) of FEMA ?   The adjudication proceedings under Section 51 of FERA read with Rule 3 of the Appeal Rules framed under FERA consists of two stages. First stage is, when the adjudicating officer forms a prima facie  opinion the basis of the materials placed before him, that a person has contravened the provisions of FERA and accordingly issues a notice (first notice) calling upon that person to show cause within such period as may be specified (being not less than ten days from the date of service thereof) as to why adjudication proceedings should not be held against him. The second stage is, when the adjudicating officer after  considering the cause if any shown by such person forms an opinion that the adjudication proceedings should be continued and accordingly issues a notice (second notice) in respect of the alleged contravention of  FERA by fixing a date for the appearance of that person either personally or through his representative. In the present case, the show cause notice dated 31-5-2002 is the first stage notice. The question is, whether the adjudicating officer can be said to have taken notice of the alleged contravention of FERA on 31/05/2002 ?  The first notice issued under Rule 3(1) is a show cause notice, which requires the notice to show cause as to why adjudication proceedings should not be initiated for the alleged contravention of FERA. Rule 3(2) requires that the show cause notice issued under Rule 3(1) must indicate the nature of the offence allegedly committed under FERA. Unless the adjudicating officer forms a prima facie opinion that the provisions of FERA have been violated, he cannot issue a show cause notice calling upon the notice to show cause as to why adjudication proceedings should not be held for the alleged contravention of FERA. Since the first notice is the foundation for initiating adjudication proceedings, the adjudicating officer cannot issue the first notice casually or without forming a prima facie opinion that the provisions of the FERA have been contravened. Therefore, the words take notice in Section 49(3) of FEMA is referable to the prima facie opinion formed before issuance of the first notice under Rule 3(1) of the Appeal Rules.\n\nThe opinion formed before issuance of the first notice relates to forming a prima facie belief on the basis of the materials placed that a person has contravened the provisions of FERA and the opinion formed after the first notice relates to sustaining the earlier prima facie belief even after considering the cause if any shown by the noticee. Therefore, it is reasonable to hold that it is only when the adjudicating officer takes notice of the alleged contravention of FERA he issues first notice under Rule 3(1) of Appeal Rules.\t [Para 21,25]"

The scope and ambit of the two proceedings are different. That is why the legislature has used two different words, namely, take cognizance in relation to criminal proceedings and 'take notice' in relation to  adjudication proceedings. The words take cognizance may cannot to take notice of judicially. In other words, in criminal proceedings 'taking cognizance' by a Magistrate would mean taking notice of the offence judicially and issue further process. Similarly, in adjudication proceedings the adjudicating officer on taking notice of the alleged contravention of FERA initiates adjudication proceedings through the process of issuing show-cause notice under rule 3(1) of the Appellate Rules. In criminal proceedings, the Magistrate even after taking cognizance of the alleged offence has the option of ordering the police to investigate the offence under Section 156(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, where as, the adjudicating officer is not conferred with such power because the two proceedings stand on different footing. Therefore, hen the legislature has specifically provided different modes for conducting the criminal proceedings and the adjudication proceedings, it would not be proper to construe the words take notice in adjudication proceedings ejusdem generis with the words take cognizance in the criminal proceedings, so as to hold that the notice under Rule 3(1) amounts to issuing notice for further investigation without taking notice of the alleged contravention of FERA. Once the show cause notice is issued under Rule 3(1) there is no scope for making any further investigation and the adjudicating officer on considering the cause, if any, shown by the noticee has to form an opinion, either to drop the adjudication proceedings or continue with the adjudication proceeding and issue notice accordingly. Therefore, the argument that the notice under Rule 3(1) is for further investigation cannot be accepted.\t [Para 28]"

Further steps to be taken thereafter in the respective proceedings are entirely different. Failure to take cognizance in the criminal proceedings or failure to take notice in the adjudication proceedings about the alleged contravention of FERA within a period of two years from the commencement of FEMA (i.e. on or before 31/05/2002) would obviously be barred under Section 49(3) of   FEMA.

Under Section 2(e) of COFEPOSA Act, 'smuggling' is to be understood as defined under clause (39) of Section 2 of the Customs Act, 1962 which provides that 'smuggling' in relation to any act or omission will render such goods liable to confiscation under Section 111 or Section 113. Section 111 contemplates confiscation of improperly imported goods and Section 113 contemplates confiscation of goods attempted to be Improperly exported. This has nothing to do with the penal provisions i.e. Sections 135 and 135A of the Customs Act which provide for punishment of an offence relating to smuggling activities. Hence, to contend that for exercising power under COFEPOSA Act for detaining a person, he must be involved in criminal offence is not borne out by the said provisions. \t\t [Para 9]\n\nOther important aspect is that COFEPOSA Act and the FEMA occupy different fields. COFEPOSA Act deals with preventive detention for violation of foreign exchange regulations and FEMA is for regulation and management of foreign exchange through authorized person and provides for penalty for contravention of the said provision. The object as stated above is for promoting orderly development and maintenance of foreign exchange market in India. Preventive detention law is for effectively keeping out of circulation the detenu during a prescribed period by means of preventive detention.  The power of detention is clearly a preventive measure. It does not partake in any manner of the nature of punishment. It is taken by way of precaution to prevent mischief to the community.\n\n(1987) 3 SCC 347, (1975) 2 SCC 81, (1975) 3 SCC 198 Ref.\t [Para 10]"

Arts.14, 19, 21 - Detention under S.3 of COFEPOSA - Validity - S.3 is not unconstitutional even after enactment of FEMA.\n\nThere is no constitutional mandate that preventive detention cannot exist for an act where such act is not a criminal offence and does not provide for punishment. An act may not be declared as an offence under law but still for such an act, which is an illegal activity, the law can provide for preventive detention if such act is prejudicial to the state security. After all, the essential concept of preventive detention is not to punish a person for what he has done but to prevent him from doing an illegal activity prejudicial to the security of the State. Strictly speaking, preventive detention is not regulation (many people call it that way), it is something much more serious as it takes away the liberty of a person but it is accepted as a necessary evil to prevent danger to the community. The law of preventative detention arms the State with precautionary action and must be seen as such. of course, the safeguards that the Constitution and preventive detention laws provide must be strictly insisted upon whenever the Court is called upon to examine the legality and validity of an order of preventive detention. On the touch stone of constitutional jurisprudence as reflected in Article 22 read with Articles 14, 19 and 21 the impugned provision of S.3 of COFEPOSA is not rendered unconstitutional even after coming into force of FEMA. It is too naive to suggest that in today's economic scenario of abundant foreign exchange and booming foreign trade, contravention of foreign exchange laws does not pose any threat to the national interest for which a person has to be detained.  [Para 60,62]\n\nIt is true that provisions of FERA and FEMA differ in some respects, particularly in respect of penalties. It is also true that FEMA does not have provision for prosecution and punishment like Section 56 of FERA and its enforcement for default is through civil imprisonment. However, insofar as conservation and/or augmentation of foreign exchange is concerned, the restrictions in FEMA continue to be as rigorous as they were in FERA. FEMA continues with the regime of rigorous control of foreign exchange and dealing in the foreign exchange is permitted only through authorised person. While its aim is to promote the orderly development and maintenance of foreign exchange markets in India, the Government's control in matters of foreign exchange has not been diluted. The conservation and augmentation of foreign exchange continues to be as important as it was under FERA. The restrictions on the dealings in foreign exchange continue to be as rigorous in FEMA as they were in FERA and the control of the Government over foreign exchange continues to be as complete and full as it was in FERA.

If he is conferred with such a right that would amount to his directing as to how the investigation should proceed.  This certainly does not belong to the person summoned.  It should be noted that the person so summoned is not one 'accused of an offence.'  The very purpose of summoning and questioning is to decide upon as to who is the real person to be proceeded against.  [Para 10]\n\nThe choice whether the person summoned should attend in person or by authorised agent vests with the officer.  A literal interpretation of this section thus admits of no doubt that it is for the officer to satisfy consistent with the object of summoning the said person whether the person summoned should attend in person or through authorised agent.  [Para 4]\n\nInterpretation of statute is to discover the intention of the legislature.  When the concerned provision admits of no doubt or ambiguity, the literal meaning of the provision giving effect to words employed therein has to prevail, for the intention of the legislature is what it states in the statute.  But the meaning to be given to a provision should be with due regard to the context in which the provision appears, for the words would capture depth and content of their meaning from the context in which they are used.  And when one speaks of context the same takes into its fold the object of the legislation revealed through the preamble and scheme of the said statute.  The very object and scope of the statute is such that such claim for the presence of lawyer at the time of questioning or to have a person of his choice to represent him, cannot be entertained and the principles of natural justice have to be heeld to be excluded by necessity.  [Para 9]\n\nWhen a question is posed as to whether the principles of natural justice have to be applied in a given situation, the Court has to balance the interest of the public/State with that of a person who is summoned.  The scheme, the purpose and object of the Act are for unearthing misappropriated money which ultimately should belong to the people of this country.  When the object of the Act is so understood, it is inescapable that a person can not insist that the authority acting under Section 40 of the Act is obliged to observe audi alteram partem.  It is exclusively for the investigating authorities to decide in a given situation whether the particular person himself must answer the questions.  [Para 9]"

The offence under Section 56 read with Section 40 of the Act is an independent offence. If the factual allegations contained in the charge are to be proved eventually at the trial of the criminal case, the appellant is still liable for the punishment notwithstanding the fact that the presence of the appellant was required by the adjudicating officer in connection with an enquiry into certain alleged violations of the various provisions of the Act, but at a subsequent stage the adjudicating officer opined that there was either insufficient or no material to proceed against the appellant for the alleged violations of the Act, is immaterial. Exonerating such an accused, who successfully evades the process of law and thereby commits an independent offence on the ground that he is found to be not guilty of the substantive offence would be destructive of law and order, apart from being against public interest. Such an exposition of law would only encourage unscrupulous elements in the society to defy the authority conferred upon the public servants to enforce the law with impunity.

In case it is found on merit that there is no contravention of the provisions of the Act in the adjudication proceeding, the trial of the person concerned shall be in abuse of the process of the court. 145(2007) DLT 612 and 2007 ALL MR (Cri) 3216 - Approved of. \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 19]\n\nIn the present case, in the adjudication proceeding on merit the adjudicating authority has categorically held that \"the charges against accused for contravening the provisions of Section 9(1)(f)(i) and Section 8(2) read with Section 64(2) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 cannot be sustained\". In the face of the aforesaid finding by the Enforcement Directorate in adjudication proceeding that there is no contravention of any of the provisions of the Act, it would be unjust and an abuse of the process of the court to permit the Enforcement Directorate to continue with the criminal prosecution.  [Para 23]\n\nPer P. Sathasivam, J. (Contra):-\tIn a statute relating to economic offences, there is no reason to restrict the scope of any provisions of the Act. These provisions ensure that no economic loss is caused by the alleged contravention by the imposition of an appropriate penalty after adjudication under Section 51 of the Act and to ensure that the tendency to violate is guarded by imposing appropriate punishment after due transaction in terms of Section 56 of the Act. In fact, it is relevant to point out that Section 23-D of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 had a proviso, which indicates that the adjudication for the imposition of penalty should precede making of complaint in writing to the court concerned for prosecuting the offender. The absence of a similar proviso to Section 51 or to Section 56 of the present 1973 Act is a clear indication that the Legislature intended to treat the two proceedings as independent of each other. There is nothing in the present Act to indicate that a finding in adjudication is binding on the Court in a prosecution under Section 56 of the Act or that the prosecution under Section 56 depends upon the result of adjudication under Section 51 of the Act. It is reiterated that the two proceedings are independent and irrespective of the outcome of the decision under Section 50, there cannot be any bar in initiating prosecution under Section 56. The scheme of the Act makes it clear that the adjudication by the concerned authorities and the prosecution are distinct and separate. No doubt, the conclusion of the adjudication, in the case on hand, the decision of the Special Director, may be a point for the appellant and it is for him to put forth the same before the Magistrate. Inasmuch as FERA contains certain provisions and features which cannot be equated with the provisions of Income Tax Act or the Customs Act and in the light of the mandate of Section 56 of the FERA, it is the duty of the Criminal Court to discharge its functions (which) vest with it and give effect to the legislative intention, particularly, in the context of the scope and object of FERA which was enacted for the economic development of the country and augmentation of revenue. Though the Act has since been repealed and not available at present, those provisions cannot be lightly interpreted taking note of the object of the Act. 2006 ALL MR (Cri) 1209 (S.C.), AIR 1970 SC 962 : 1969(2) SCR 438 - Rel. on.

Where the goods are freely importable, the imported goods purchased from the acquired foreign exchange may be sold in high sea sale basis and the person who purchased the goods on high sea sale basis can seek clearance of the said goods.  In such a case, it cannot be said that the goods purchased have not been brought into India, merely because the goods are not cleared by the person acquiring the foreign exchange.  In the present case, admittedly the goods are brought into India and in the absence of any obligation to use the goods in any particular manner, clearance of the goods by the auction purchaser cannot be a ground to hold that the goods have not been brought into India.  Consequently, it cannot be said that the foreign exchange has not been used for the purpose for which it was acquired.   [Para 16]"

In the present case, there is no dispute that the proceedings under FERA were initiated within the stipulated time and that the petitioners have a substantive right of filing an appeal against the adjudication orders passed under FERA. However, the dispute is whether such appeals are maintainable before the Special Director (Appeals) or before the Appellate Tribunal constituted under FEMA. Admittedly, there was one appellate forum provided under FERA against the orders passed by the Adjudicating Authorities under FERA. However, under FEMA, the legislature has provided for two appellate forum against the orders of the Adjudicating Authorities under FEMA. In view of the dissolution of the Appellate Board constituted under FERA, as per Section 49 of FEMA, appeals against the orders passed by the Adjudicating Authorities under FERA have to be instituted before the corresponding appellate forum constituted under FEMA. Section 17(1) of FEMA empowers the Central Government to appoint one or more Special Director (Appeals) to hear appeals against the orders of the Adjudicating Authorities set out in that section. The words 'Adjudicating Authorities under this Section' in Section 17(1) clearly signifies that the powers of Special Director (Appeals) are restricted to the appeals against the orders passed by the Adjudicating Authorities specified in that section. Section 17(2) of FEMA specifically provides that appeals against orders of the Adjudicating Authority, such as Assistant Director / Deputy Director of Enforcement would be maintainable before the Special Director (Appeals) appointed under Section 17(1). Thus, the powers of the Special Director (Appeals) appointed under Section 17(1) is restricted to hear appeals against the orders of the Adjudicating Authority such as Assistant Director /Deputy Director of Enforcement.

The Department was duty bound to make a refund within a reasonable period. The Department failed to do so for nearly 12 years thereafter for which there is not even a plausible explanation in the affidavit in reply. In the reply, it has been stated that the Petitioner should be relegated to the remedy of filing a suit and that the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973 does not provide for payment of interest in such circumstances. The conduct of the Enforcement Directorate is completely contrary to law. The Enforcement Directorate was duty bound to refund the amount which was seized from the premises of the Petitioner after adjusting the personal penalty in terms of the order passed by the adjudicating authority. Detaining monies of a citizen for ten years is totally violative of the rule of law. The writ Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution has sufficient powers in such cases to award interest.  [Para 5]"

Reasons for the same set out in detail hereinbelow.\t [Para 22]\n\n\tFirst, if the Adjudicating Officer had passed an order under Section 51 of FERA prior to 01.06.2000, then the appeal against such order was required to be filed before the Appellate Board under Section 52 (2) of FERA. In other words, if the Adjudicating Officer had passed the order under Section 51 of FERA prior to 01.06.2000 when FERA was in force, the appeal against such order was maintainable only under Section 52 (2) before the Appellate Board under FERA.\t\t\t\t [Para 23]\n\n\tSecond, if such appeal had remained pending before the Appellate Board on 01.06.2000, the same would have been transferred to Appellate Tribunal constituted under FEMA in terms of Section 49 (5)(b) of FEMA for its disposal.\t [Para 24]\n\n\tThird, a fortiori, any appeal, if filed after 01.06.2000 and against the similar order, i.e., an order passed under Section 51 of FERA should also be held to lie before the Appellate Tribunal under Section 19 of FEMA alike the appeals filed prior to 01.06.2000 and which were transferred to the Appellate Tribunal by virtue of Section 49(5)(b) of FEMA.\t\t [Para 26]\n\n\tFourth, the reason behind this simultaneous statutory transfer of pending appeals to the Appellate Tribunal under FEMA appears to be that the legislature did not intend to provide two separate Appellate Authorities under FEMA for challenging the adjudication order passed under Section 51 of the FERA, i.e., one appeal before the Special Director (Appeals) and the other appeal before the Appellate Tribunal under FEMA.\t [Para 27]\n\n\tIn other words, the legislature did not intend to make a distinction between the two appeals for their disposal by two different appellate authorities under FEMA only because one appeal was filed prior to 01.06.2000, therefore, it will lie before the Appellate Tribunal whereas the other appeal which was filed after 01.06.2000 though against the similar order, it will lie before the Special Director (Appeals). There does not appear to be any justifiable reason to make such distinction for filing of appeals filed against the similar order passed under FERA before two different appellate authorities under FEMA.\t [Para 28]\n\n\tSo far as Section 81(c) of FERA, 1973 is concerned, it deals with Repeal and Saving of FERA, 1947. Clause (c) of Section 81 specifically provides that all the appeals filed under Section 23 of FERA, 1947, whether pending on the date of Repeal or/and those filed after the repeal of FERA, 1947, shall be disposed of by the Appellate Board constituted under FERA, 1973.\t [Para 31]\n\n\tIt is true that Section 49 (5)(b) of FEMA is not worded alike Section 81 (c) of FERA, yet, it shows the intention of the legislature that all such appeals have to be heard by the Appellate Board under the FERA. \t\t\t [Para 32]\n\n\tThere is no reason as to why the same legislative intent while interpreting the provisions of FERA, 1973 and FEMA, 1999 is applied for deciding the identical question now arising in the case.\t [Para 36]\n\n\tApplying the principle of purposive interpretation, held that appellate forum for deciding the appeals arising out of the order passed under Section 51 of FERA whether filed prior to 01.06.2000 or filed after 01.06.2000 must be the same, i.e., Appellate Tribunal under FEMA.\t [Para 40]"

In a given case where adjudication proceedings are finally concluded and the result thereof is in favour of the accused, the prosecution may have to be dropped.  The possibility of success in an adjudication proceeding can be no ground for quashing the prosecution.  There may be a case where the accused may be charged with grave offences under the IPC apart from those under the Customs Act or the Income-tax Act or the like.  In that case, the prosecution may still have to go on.   [Para 18]\n\nSince in this case, the adjudicating authorities have exonerated the petitioner and the said orders have not been challenged and have thus assumed finality, it is improper on the part of the respondents to prosecute the petitioner on the same facts.  If the authorities were serious, they would have challenged the order passed by the Additional Director, Enforcement Directorate, dated 27/9/1992. They would have also challenged the order dated 11/9/1998 passed by the CEGAT.  They seem to have accepted the conclusions of the adjudicating authority that the petitioner is innocent.  In such circumstances, the pending prosecution will have to be quashed. (1987) 32 D.L.T. 91 (Delhi), AIR 2003 SC 2545 and AIR 2002 SC 823 - Referred to.  [Para 21]"

                ],
                "description": "Purchase of foreign exchange - Purchaser offering higher rate than fixed by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) - Seller authorised dealer should have enquired about credentials of purchaser.\n\nOnce an Authorised Dealer duly complies with the instructions laid down in the Memorandum of instructions to Full Fledge Money Changer (FLM), issued by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) under Section 73(3) of FERA, while undertaking money changing transactions with another Authorised Dealer.  Even then such authorised dealer can be held liable for violation of Ss.6(4) and (5) of Foreign Exchange Regulation Act (1973).  In the instant case, the Appellant was at the relevant time, was a duly licensed Full Fledge Money Changer (FFMC) and/or an Authorised Dealer, who was issued the requisite licence by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to deal in and/or transact foreign exchange.  The proceedings have arisen on account of the show cause notice which came to be issued to the Appellants for violation of Sections 6(4), 6(5), 7 and 8(i) of the FERA.  The said show cause notice came to be issued a result of certain investigations which were carried out by the Department of Revenue Intelligence (DRI) into the affairs of two FFMCs and/or authorised dealers i.e. Hotel Zam Zam and M/s. Gulf Enterprises.  In so far as present Appeals are concerned, the relevant FFMC is Hotel Zam Zam.  It was alleged by the DRI that Hotel Zam Zam had purchased from the Appellant, foreign exchange of US $ 147,000 and UK Pounds 1000 between - April to June, 1997 and, thereafter had sold the same to certain unauthorised persons.  The facts of the instant case disclose that the said Hotel Zam Zam though a FFMC had offered to purchase the foreign exchange at a higher rate than the exchange rate fixed by the RBI.  The Appellants, therefore, in terms of Section 6(4) of FERA ought to have reported the matter to the RBI in respect of the said contemplated transaction and should have avoided to go through the said transaction.  Also, in terms of Section 6(5), the authorised dealer i.e. in the instant case the Appellant-Tulip Star Hotels Ltd., should have inquired from the representative of Hotel Zam Zam as regards his credentials which include his registration with the RBI as an authorised representative of the concerned FFMC as that is the requirement of Para 3 of the FLM under which Para the FFMC has to forward to the RBI the names of the persons whom it desires to appoint as its representatives. From the evidence in the instant case of the Executive Director of the Appellant-Tulip Star Hotels Limited, it is crystal clear that the said exercise was not carried out and a large amount of foreign exchange was handed over to the representative of the said Hotel Zam Zam without checking his credentials in terms of section 6(5) of FERA. That the fact that the foreign exchange ultimately reached the said Hotel Zam Zam cannot extricate the Appellants from violation of Section 6(5) as ultimately, the said foreign exchange was sold in the black market.  [Para 3,12,13]\n\nGoing by a literal construction of the provision of S.6(5), the same unequivocally leads to a conclusion that the obligation cast in Section 6(5) is both on the seller as well as purchaser and cannot be restricted to only the seller. In a sense the said provision casts a duty and the said duty has been cast by the legislature with some purpose considering the fact that the FFMCs are dealing in foreign exchange. In the light of the above, the submission of the counsel for the Appellants that a penal provision should be construed in a manner so as to absolve the defaulter of the penalty cannot be accepted for the aforesaid reasons. In so far as the submission of the counsel for the Appellants that in so far as Hotel Zam Zam is concerned, it was a licensed FFMC and therefore what it did after the foreign exchange reached it was without the knowledge of the Appellants and there was therefore no mens rea on the part of the Appellants cannot be accepted. It also cannot be lost sight of that the said Hotel Zam Zam offered a higher rate than the official rate, such a transaction therefore was clearly prohibited by virtue of sub-section (2) of Section 8, unless the previous general or special permission of the RBI was obtained. In the instant case, admittedly no such permission was obtained. The said transaction therefore can also be said to be in breach of Section 8(2) of the FERA.\t\t\t  [Para 14]"

                "description": "Liability of Company - Section 56(1)(i) prescribing sentence of imprisonment and fine - In such a case court can impose punishment of fine in case of a juristic person - Companies cannot claim blanket immunity from prosecution for serious offences merely because prosecution would entail mandatory imprisonment - View expressed by majority in Velliappa Textiles case overruled by majority of 3 : 2 in this case (Per Balkrishnan, Dharmadhikari and Arun Kumar, JJ. Srikrishna and Hegde JJ. dissmenting).\n\nPer Balkrishnan, J., Dharmadhikari and Arun Kumar, JJ. concurring :-  There is no immunity to the companies from prosecution merely because the prosecution is in respect of offences for which the punishment prescribed is mandatory imprisonment and fine. As the company cannot be sentenced to imprisonment, the court cannot impose that punishment, but when imprisonment and fine is the prescribed punishment the court can impose the punishment of fine which could be enforced against the company. Such a discretion is to be read into the section so far as the juristic person is concerned. Of course, the court cannot exercise the same discretion as regards a natural person. Then the court would not be passing the sentence in accordance with law. As regards company, the court can always impose a sentence of fine and the sentence of imprisonment can be ignored as it is impossible to be carried out in respect of a company. This appears to be the intention of the legislature and we find no difficulty in construing the statute in such a way. We do not think that there is a blanket immunity for any company from any prosecution for serious offences merely because the prosecution would ultimately entail a sentence of mandatory imprisonment. The corporate bodies, such as a firm or company undertake a series of activities that affect the life, liberty and property of the citizens. Large-scale financial irregularities are done by various corporations. The corporate vehicle now occupies such a large portion of the industrial, commercial and sociological sectors that amenability of the corporation to a criminal law is essential to have a peaceful society with stable economy. [Para 31,32]\n\nPer Srikrishna, J. (on behalf of N. Santosh Hegde, J. and himself):-  The majority judgment in Velliappa(supra) indicates that the situation is not one of an interpretational exercise, but one that calls for rectification of an irretrievable error in drafting of the statute concerned. It has noticed the two Reports of the Law Commission of India of 1941 and 1947 pointing out the impossibility of implementing such a provision without transgressing the well-established bounds of judicial functions and taking on the role of the legislature. It was also pointed out that the situation is neither novel, nor unique. Such situation has been faced in several other jurisdictions wherein it was recognised that the only solution to such a problem is by legislative action. Instances from the jurisdictions in Australia, France, Canada, the Netherlands and Belgium were referred to. There was also reference made to the fact that the Indian Parliament was cognizant of the problem and had proposed the IPC (Amendment) Bill, 1972, clause 72(a) of which specifically was intended to take care of a situation where the offender is a company and the offence is mandatorily punishable with imprisonment in which case the option was given to the court to sentence such a corporate offender to fine only. Reference was also made in Velliappa (supra) to the fact that the said Amendment Bill had lapsed.   [Para 56]\n\nOne of the functions of the court is to ascertain the true intention of Parliament in enacting the statute and, as far as permissible on the language of the statute, to interpret the statute to advance such legislative intent. If this be the test, there is no doubt that Parliament has accepted the view taken in the majority in Velliappa (supra) as correct. Velliappa (supre) interpreted the situation arising out of a prosecution under Sections 276-C, 277, 278 read with Section 278-B of the Income Tax Act, 1961 and the judgment was delivered on 16-9-2003. Section 278-B was promptly amended by Parliament by insertion of sub-section (3) by the Finance (No.2) Act, 2004 w.e.f. 1-10-2004. Thus, if the interpretative function of the court be to find out the true intention of Parliament, then such intention has been manifested in the amendments adopting the manner of resolving the difficulty indicated by Velliappa.   [Para 58,60]\n\nWe are unable to subscribe to the view that by \"judicial heroics\" it is open to the court to remedy an irretrievable legislative error by resort to the theory of presumed intention of the legislature. It was contended that the court should adopt a purposive construction of statutes. The dicta of Denning, L.J. in Seaford Court Estates Ltd. Vs. Asher, (1949)2 All ER 155, p.164(CA) were pressed into service for emulation. The view of Denning, L.J., that \"judicial heroics\" were warranted to cope with the difficulties arising in statutory interpretation was cited with disapproval by Apex Court in Punjab Land Development and Reclamation Corporation Ltd. Vs. Presiding Officer, Labour Court, (1990)3 SCC 682. The argument of purposive interpretation, therefore, does not appeal when the statute in plain terms says something.\t [Para 62]\n\nSome counsel have argued that it is open to the court to read the words \"imprisonment and fine\" as \"imprisonment or fine\". In our view, such a construction is impermissible. First, it virtually amounts to rewriting of the section. The court would be reading the section as applicable to different situations with different meanings. If the offender is a corporate entity, then only fine is imposable; if the offender is a natural person, he shall be visited with both the mandatory term of imprisonment and fine. The exercise would then become one of putting a fluctuating or varying interpretation on the statute depending upon the circumstances. That is not permissible for the court, either on principle, or on precedent. While it may be permissible for the court to read the word \"and\" as \"or\", or vice versa, whatever the interpretation, it must be uniformly applied to all situations. If the conjunction \"and\" is read disjunctively as \"or\", then the intention of Parliament would definitely be defeated as the mandatory term of imprisonment would not be available even in the case of a natural person. Secondly, when a statute says the court shall impose a term of \"imprisonment and a fine\", there is no option left in the court to say that under certain circumstances it would not impose the mandatory term of imprisonment. It is trite principle that punishment must follow the conviction. Thirdly, if on the words used by the legislature it is impossible to effectuate the intention of the legislation, namely, to punish a company to imprisonment, it is not possible to read the section in any other manner to impose any other punishment on the offender.   [Para 63,64,66]\n\nThe maxim \"lex non cogit ad impossibilia\", like all maxims, only tells us that law does not contemplate something which cannot be done. The maxim applies, insofar as persuading the court to hold that it is impossible to send a company to prison. The maxim by itself does not empower the court to break up the section into convenient parts and apply them selectively. Nor does the maxim \"impotentia excusat legem\" apply here for the same reason. Au contraire, the application of these two maxims could equally persuade the court to ignore the language of the statutory provision in the case of a juristic person, there being no warrant for dissecting the section and treating only one part as capable of implementation when the mandate of the section is to impose the whole of the prescribed punishment. [Para 70]\n\nThe maxim \"ut res magis valeat quam pereat\" cannot enable the court to put a variant construction on the statute, which would vary with the circumstances of different cases. For example, if this maxim is applied to construe a section such as Section 56(1)(i) of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973, it is not permissible for the court to hold that the section would mean one thing in the case of an offender, who is a natural person and something else in the case of an offender, who is a juristic person. Such a situation can only be brought about by parliamentary legislation of the nature cited earlier. The mandate of the legislature can be interpreted so as to advance the purpose of the legislation.  Whatever interpretation is given must be applicable equally in all situations. Neither this maxim, nor any other maxim, enables a court to interpret a statute in different ways under different fact situations.   [Para 72]\n\nA final argument, more in terrorem than based on reason, put forward was that, if the majority view in Velliappa (2003)11 SCC 405 is upheld, it would be impossible to prosecute a number of offenders in several statutes where strict liability has been imposed by the statute. If that be so, so be it. The judicial function is limited to finding solutions within specified parameters. Anything more than that would be \"judicial heroics\" and \"naked usurpation of legislative function.\" For all these reasons, we are of the opinion that the majority view of this Court in Velliappa is correct and does not require any reconsideration by this Bench.

As such, its application cannot be extended to the penalty proceeding.  [Para 43]\n\nSection 68 springs into operation to identify every person who is liable to be punished of imprisonment for the contravention by the Company. However, penalty can be saddled on the company (being any person) if it has contravened. Section 50 does not refer to every person as envisaged by Section 68. As such, Section 68 cannot be availed to indict the officials of the Company for the purposes of penalty. further more, Section 50 lays down the outer limit of penalty. Such penalty can be imposed against the company being a person contravening the Act of 1973. Such penalty,if Section 68 is extended would be leviable against each person so indicted.

The burden is on the prosecution to show that the confession is voluntary in nature and not obtained as an outcome of threat, etc. if the same is to be relied upon solely for the purpose of securing a conviction. With a view to arrive at a finding as regards the voluntary nature of statement or otherwise of a confession which has since been retracted, the Court must bear in mind the attending circumstances which would include the time of retraction, the nature thereof, the manner in which such retraction has been made and other relevant factors. Law does not say that the accused has to prove that retraction of confession made by him was because of threat, coercion, etc. but the requirement is that it may appear to the court as such. In the instant case, the Investigating Officers did not examine themselves. The authorities under the Act as also the Tribunal did not arrive at a finding upon application of their mind to the retraction and rejected the same upon assigning cogent and valid reasons therefor. Whereas mere retraction of a confession may not be sufficient to make the confessional statement irrelevant for the purpose of a proceeding in a criminal case or a quasi-criminal case but there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that the court is obligated to take into consideration the pros and cons of both the confession and retraction made by the accused. It is one thing to say that a retracted confession is used as a corroborative piece of evidence to record a finding of guilt but it is another thing to say that such a finding is arrived at only on the basis of such confession although retracted at a later stage.

On a combined reading of Section 49 of FEMA and Section 6 of General Clauses Act, it is clear that the procedure prescribed by FEMA only would be applicable in respect of an appeal filed under FEMA though cause of action arose under FERA. In fact, the time limit prescribed under FERA was taken away under the proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 19 and the Tribunal has been conferred with wide powers to condone delay if the appeal is not filed within forty-five days prescribed, provided sufficient cause is shown. Therefore, the findings rendered by the Tribunal as well as the High Court that the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to condone the delay beyond the date prescribed under FERA is not a correct understanding of the law on the subject. [Para 28]\n\nSection 52(2) can apply only to an appeal to the appellate Board and not to any appellate tribunal. Therefore, irrespective of the fact that the adjudicating officer had passed the orders with reference to the violation of the provisions of FERA, as the appeal against such order was to the appellate tribunal constituted under FEMA, necessarily Section 19(2) of FEMA alone will apply and it is not possible to import the provisions of Section 52(2) of FERA. As we are not concerned with the appeals to Appellate Board, but appeals to the Appellate Tribunal, limitation being a matter of procedure, only that law that is applicable at the time of filing the appeal, would apply. Therefore, Section 19(2) of FEMA and not Section 52(2) of FERA will apply. As noticed above, under Section 19(2), there is no ceiling in regard to the period of delay that could be condoned by the appellate tribunal. If sufficient cause is made out, delay beyond 45 days can also be condoned. The tribunal and the High Court misdirected themselves in assuming that the period of limitation was governed by Section 52(2) of FERA.  \t\t\t [Para 26]\n\nIf the appellant was prevented by sufficient cause from filing an appeal in time, the appellate authority under FERA could not condone the delay beyond 45 days whereas under FEMA, if the sufficient cause is made out, the delay can be condoned without any limit. Any provision relating to limitation is always regarded as procedural and in the absence of any provision to the contrary, the law in force on the date of the institution of the appeal, irrespective of the date of accrual of the cause of action for the original order, will govern the period of limitation.   [Para 25]\n\nSection 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 which protects the rights, obligations and actions and liabilities applies in spite of repeal of FERA subject to two years limitation period specified in sub-section (3) of Section 49 for initiation of proceedings. Therefore, in view of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act read with sub-section (3) of Section 49 of FEMA, proceedings for violation of FERA can be instituted within the sunset period of two years with effect from 1.6.2000 till 31.5.2002. But for sub-section(3) there will be no limitation period of two years in view of Section 6 of General Clauses Act, 1897 read with sub-section (4) of Section 49 of FEMA.   [Para 23]"

Only when an officer is so specifically authorized, he can act on behalf of the Central Government and not otherwise. Only because an officer has been appointed for the purpose of acting in terms of the provisions of the Act, the same would not by itself entitle to an officer to discharge all or any of the functions of the Central Government.

                "description": "Offence by company - Prosecution of person in charge or other officer who has committed offence - Not discriminatory on ground of discretion in deciding whom to prosecute.\n\nIn the first instance in view of the fact that the FERA has been included in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution, the challenge based on Articles 14 and 21 cannot prevail even assuming that the arguments have any substance.  But on the scheme of the Act, with particular regard to Sections 56, 59, 61 and 68 of FERA, the provisions cannot be successfully challenged as either being arbitrary or discriminatory.  All that Section 68(1) says is that if the commission of an offence by the company is proved, the person who was in charge and was responsible to the company for the conduct of the business of the company at the time the contravention was committed, was to be deemed to be guilty of the contravention and was liable to be proceeded against and punished.  He is being punished in view of his status in the company and because it is proved that the company is guilty of contravention of any of the provisions of FERA.  There is nothing unreasonable in this, since a company normally acts through a person who is in charge of its affairs and even in that case, the person in charge and responsible to the company for the conduct of its business, is given an opportunity to show that the alleged contravention by the company took place without his knowledge or in spite of the exercise of all due diligence by him to prevent such contravention.  Section 68(2) is attracted in a case where a company has contravened the provisions of the Act or any rule, direction or order made thereunder and that particular contravention is proved to have taken place with the consent or connivance or is attributable to any neglect on the part of any Director, Manager, Secretary or other officer of the company.  In other words, the prosecution, in addition to prosecuting the company, can also prosecute any particular officer whose action or inaction or negligence resulted in the commission of the particular offence by the company.  This only means that a person who is instrumental in the commission of an act by the company that is in contravention of FERA or the rules or directions issued thereunder, also lays himself open to prosecution.  Having done something or omitted to do something leading to the company contravening the provisions of the Act, the officer concerned cannot say that it is unreasonable to prosecute him also, along with the company and the person in charge of and responsible to the company for the conduct of its business.  [Para 15]\n\nThe argument that the section violates Article 14 of the Constitution cannot thus be accepted.  The same is the position regarding the argument based on Article 21 of the Constitution.  The object of the Act is clearly to protect the economic interests of the country and to deal with any violation that causes economic loss to the country.  In the context of that object, any contravention of the provisions of the Act have to be viewed seriously and any one directly responsible or conniving at the offence is liable to be punished.  This appears to be the legislative intent in enacting FERA 1973 replacing the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1947 and also including it in the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution.  [Para 16]"

                "description": "Offence by company - Word \"punished\" and \"offence\" in S.68 - Cannot be limited to criminal prosecution - Would apply to penalty proceedings as well.\n\nMerely because the expression 'punished' is used, it does not mean that it is confined to a prosecution under Section 56 of the Act, since the element that attracts the imposition of penalty and the prosecution is the same, namely, the contravention of any of the provisions of the Act.  Moreover, there is nothing in the Act which confines the expression 'punished' only to a punishment for a criminal prosecution. An imposition of a penalty can also be a punishment.  The second part of the reasoning appears to be self-contradictory.  If a person includes a company, there is no reason to confine Section 68 to a prosecution only, because the company as a person is liable to be proceeded against under Section 50 and Section 56 of the Act, though in a criminal prosecution the punishment by way of imprisonment can be imposed only on the officer or officers of the company referred to in Section 68 of the Act.  Section 68 only indicates the manner in which a contravention by a company can be dealt with and it does not show that it is confined in its operation only to prosecutions against a company.  It is a general provision relating to a contravening company, which is to be proceeded against whether it be under Section 50 or under Section 56 of the Act.  The fact that a fine alone can be imposed on a company in a prosecution under Section 56 of the Act, cannot enable us to confine the operation of Section 68 to criminal prosecutions alone under the Act.  [Para 29]\n\nUse of the expression 'offence' in the marginal heading of Section 68 is not indicative of the expression 'being confined to a criminal offence alone' because an offence in the context of the Act is really a contravention of any of the provisions of the Act referred to in Section 50 and in Section 56 of the Act.\t [Para 30]"

The Customs Act, can be said to be a cognate law, in so far as the FERA is concerned, and, therefore, though the findings recorded in the Customs proceedings, may not be binding on the FERA proceedings. They cannot be said to be having no evidentiary value whilst deciding the proceedings under the FERA. In the light of the same finding of the CEGAT, which have been reaffirmed by the FERA Tribunal as also the Order passed by the ITAT, it is not possible in appeal to take a different view.  [Para 16]"

Appellant sought to rely upon the Notification dated 6-3-2009 by which Notification the Central Government has empowered the Director of Enforcement to file proceedings. The said Notification can be of no avail in the instant matter as the instant proceedings were originally filed in the year 2005 as Writ petitions, when the said Notification was not even in existence. The said Writ petitions were thereafter converted to Appeals in the year 2006. It is pertinent to note that the application for amendment for substitution of the Enforcement Directorate with the Union of India was made in the year 2010 i.e. almost after a period of 5 years of the filing of the proceedings. Objection of the Respondents to the maintainability of the Appeals would have to be sustained on the application of Mohte Sham's Case (Supra) and resultantly, the Appeals would have to be dismissed on the ground that the Director of Enforcement who was the adjudicating authority had no authority to file the Appeals. 2007 ALL SCR 2650 - Rel. on.

                ],
                "description": "Powers conferred on Commissioner and State Government - Are discretionary in nature.\n\nPermissive language used by the Statute in Section 14 and the rule making authority in Rule 4 gives the State Government and the Commissioner, no mandatory duty or obligation to grant the licence except perhaps to consider the application, if the liquor policy permits so. Section 14 uses the expression \"Commissioner may\", \"with the approval of the Government\" so also Rule 4 uses the expressions \"Commissioner may\", \"if he is satisfied\" after making such enquiries as he may consider necessary \"licence may be issued\". All those expressions used in Section 14 and Rule 4 confer discretionary powers on the Commissioner as well as the State Government, not a discretionary power coupled with duty. The powers, conferred on the Commissioner as well as the Government, have to be understood in the light of the Constitutional scheme bearing in mind the fact that the trade or business which is inherently harmful can always be restricted, curtailed or prohibited by the State, since it is the exclusive privilege of the State. No duty is, therefore, cast on the Commissioner to grant a licence for establishing a distillery unit and no right is conferred on any citizen to claim it as a matter of right. State can always adopt a \"restrictive policy\", e.g., reducing the number of licences in a particular district or a particular area, or not to grant any licence at all in a particular district, even in cases where the applicants have satisfied all the conditions stipulated in the rules and the policy permits granting of licences. In other words, the satisfaction of the conditions laid -down in 1975 Rules would not entitle an applicant as a matter of right to claim a distillery licence which is within the exclusive privilege of the State. \n\nMandamus - To Issue Licence :- Legislature when confers a discretionary power on an authority, it has to be exercised by it in its discretion, the decision ought to be that of the authority concerned and not that of the Court. Court would not interfere with or probe into the merits of the decision made by an authority in exercise of its discretion. Court cannot impede the exercise of discretion of an authority acting under the Statute by issuance of a Writ of Mandamus. A Writ of Mandamus can be issued in favour of an applicant who establishes a legal right in himself and is issued against an authority which has a legal duty to perform, but has failed and/or neglected to do so, but such a legal duty should emanate either in discharge of the public duty or operation of law. There is no legal duty cast on the Commissioner or the State Government exercising powers under Section 14 of the Act read with Rule 4 of the 1975 Rules to grant the licence applied for. The High Court, cannot direct the State Government to part with its exclusive privilege. At best, it can direct consideration of an application for licence. If the High Court feels, in spite of its direction, the application has not been properly considered or arbitrarily rejected, the High Court is not powerless to deal with such a situation that does not mean that the High Court can bend or break the law. Granting liquor licence is not like granting licence to drive a cab or parking a vehicle or issuing a municipal licence to set up a grocery or a fruit shop. Before issuing a writ of mandamus, the High Court should have, at the back of its mind, the legislative scheme, its object and purpose, the subject matter, the evil sought to be remedied, State's exclusive privilege etc. and not to be carried away by the idiosyncrasies or the ipse dixit of an officer who authored the order challenged. Majesty of law is to be upheld not by bending or breaking the law but by strengthening the law. \t    [Para 25,26,27]"

It is not in dispute that under the EXIM policy prevalent in 1997-2002 as well as 2002-2007, natural rubber could be imported duty free under an advance licence (except for the period when the Central Government had banned import of natural rubber under an advance licence).  Under these circumstances, the implementing agency namely, the DGFT who is empowered to prescribe the norms and the procedures for implementing the EXIM policy could not prohibit import of natural rubber under advance licence, when the EXIM policy specifically permits import of natural rubber under an advance licence.  The impugned Circulars and the public notice issued by DGFT, in fact, nullify the express provisions of the EXIM Policy framed by the Central Government.  Power to amend the policy being within the exclusive domain of the Central Government, the said powers cannot be usurped by the DGFT in the guise of laying down regulatory measures.  By prohibiting import of natural rubber under the advance licence in the Hand Book of procedures, the DGFT has encroached upon the powers of the Central Government and purported to amend the EXIM policy 2002-2007 which power is not conferred upon the DGFT.  Therefore the A.L.C. circulars and the public notice issued by the DGFT, cannot be sustained as they are wholly inconsistent with the EXIM Policy framed by the Central Government and in fact they purport to amend the EXIM Policy provisions which power is exclusively vested in the Central Government and not with the DGFT.\t [Para 11]\n\n\tThe procedures to be prescribed by an authority in implementing the policy must be in consonance with the policy.  If the procedural norms are in conflict with the policy, then the policy will prevail and the procedural norms to the extent they are in conflict with the policy, are liable to be held to be bad in law.  In the instant case, since the impugned circulars and the public notice issued by DGFT are in conflict with policy, the same are liable to be quashed and set aside.\n [Para 15]"

Merely because one of the Ministries of the Government of India had granted permission, that permission would not be permission for the purpose of the Forest (Conservation) Act 1980.  [Para 11]\n\nIn the instant case, the  entire land consists of about 3000 trees. It is contiguous to a Government forest. Though the land has been described in the revenue records as dry crop land, that by itself would be no answer as what the Section 2 of the Act contemplates is not only forest but forest land.The wrong discription of the land cannot  prevent application of 1980 Act.\t [Para 12,17]\n\nThe Govt. could not have created a lease in favour of company without taking prior permission under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Any action taken in contravention of Section 2 is punishable under Section 3-A and 3-B of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. It was, therefore, unlawful being contrary to Section 23 of the Contract Act, 1872. The contract being therefore unlawful, is a nullity in law.  [Para 15]\n\nFurther, the land leased is situated to an adjacent Government forest and the land is sought to be used for setting up of a beneficiation plant which involves dust and water pollution and consequent destruction of the adjoining forest. It will substantially affect the environment and ecology of the area. This, in fact, would affect the right to life. The petitioners in the petition have averred that the cutting of trees without obtaining permission was resorted to. In matters of ecology and environment and considering the principle of sustainable development, no person or organization, however, high and mighty they may be, can be permitted to flout the law of the land. In the circumstances the lease is still born, null and void. The land, has to be restored to its original use.  [Para 17,18]"

The re-forestation or afforestation that is being carried out in India does not meet the fundamentals and the planting of new trees to match the numbers removed is too simplistic and archaic a solution, as in the guise of compensatory replantation, local varieties of trees are being replaced by alien and non-indigenous but fast growing varieties such as poplar and eucalyptus which make up the numbers but cannot satisfy the needs of our environmental system. It must be borne in mind that both re-forestation and afforestation envisage a resurrection and re-plantation of trees and other flora similar to those which have been removed and which are suitable to the area in question. There is yet another circumstance which is even more disturbing inasmuch as the removal of existing forest or trees suited to the local environment have destroyed the eco system dependent on them.

The section begins with a non obstante clause providing that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force in a State, no State Government or other authority shall make, except with the prior approval of the Central Government any order of the nature enumerated in the provision. Section 3 of the Conservation Act deals with constitution of Advisory Committee and S. 4 deals with powers to make rules. Rules 4, 5 and 6 of the Forest Conservation Rules, 1981 (in short 'Conservation Rules') are relevant. Rule 4 deals with procedure to make proposal by a State Government or their authority. Rule 5 deals with the powers of the Committee to advise on proposals received by the Central Government. The Committee referred to therein is the one constituted under S. 3 of the Act. Rule 6 deals with action of the Central Government on the advice of the Committee. Admittedly, the Central Government has not accorded the approval for use of any forest land or any portion thereof for being used for any non-forest purpose. That being so Rule 29(b) of the Mineral Rules cannot be of any assistance to the company. So far as the order dated 14-11-2000 in W.P. No. 337/2000 is concerned, it is clear therefrom that de-reservation of forests, sanctuaries and national parks was prohibited. Therefore, exclusion of company's land in terms of the Notification under S. 35(4) of the Act though same was being used for mining by the company, was not in order to that extent.

Merely because one of the Ministries of the Government of India had granted permission, that permission would not be permission for the purpose of the Forest (Conservation) Act 1980.  [Para 11]\n\nIn the instant case, the  entire land consists of about 3000 trees. It is contiguous to a Government forest. Though the land has been described in the revenue records as dry crop land, that by itself would be no answer as what the Section 2 of the Act contemplates is not only forest but forest land.The wrong discription of the land cannot  prevent application of 1980 Act.\t [Para 12,17]\n\nThe Govt. could not have created a lease in favour of company without taking prior permission under Section 2 of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. Any action taken in contravention of Section 2 is punishable under Section 3-A and 3-B of the Forest (Conservation) Act, 1980. It was, therefore, unlawful being contrary to Section 23 of the Contract Act, 1872. The contract being therefore unlawful, is a nullity in law.  [Para 15]\n\nFurther, the land leased is situated to an adjacent Government forest and the land is sought to be used for setting up of a beneficiation plant which involves dust and water pollution and consequent destruction of the adjoining forest. It will substantially affect the environment and ecology of the area. This, in fact, would affect the right to life. The petitioners in the petition have averred that the cutting of trees without obtaining permission was resorted to. In matters of ecology and environment and considering the principle of sustainable development, no person or organization, however, high and mighty they may be, can be permitted to flout the law of the land. In the circumstances the lease is still born, null and void. The land, has to be restored to its original use.  [Para 17,18]"

Secondly, just as Authorised Officer is not a Criminal Court, the Forest Officer rendering material in support of prayer for confiscation is not a Police Officer.  A quasi judicial authority would be prevented from considering any material only if it is shown that consideration of such material is barred by any specific provision of law.  Statements recorded by the Forest Officer do not fall in the category of \"confession\", since a confession could be made only by a person, who is accused of an offence confessing to his crime.  Statements of some of the persons considered by the Authorised Officer in this case would be at the best akin to admission or former statements of witnesses, which would suggest an inference as to a fact in issue or relevant fact, namely, use of the tractor and trolley in commission of a forest offence.  Therefore, there was no impropriety on the part of the Authorised Officer in considering the statements recorded by the Range Forest Officer.

Since in this case, the Authorised Officer was satisfied that a forest offence had been committed and that the tractor and trolley had been used in committing such offence.  Moreover as apart from complying with the principles of natural justice, the Authorised Officer has also complied with the requirements of Section 61-A to 61-G of the Forest Act by giving full opportunity to the petitioner after supplying the petitioner all the relevant material.

                "description": "Forest produce - Illegal transportation of - Seizure and subsequent release of - Vehicle seized shall not normally be returned till culmination of proceedings - Liberal approach in this matter is more likely to frustrate provisions of the Act.\n\nThe provisions of the Act are required to be strictly complied with and followed for the purposes of achieving the object for which the Act was enacted. Liberal approach in the matter with respect to the property seized, which is liable to confiscation, is uncalled for as the same is likely to frustrate the provisions of the Act. Before passing an order for releasing the forest produce or the property used in the commission of the forest offence, the Authorised Officer or the Appellate Authority has to specify the reasons which justify such release, apparently, prima facie excluding the possibility of such forest produce or the property being confiscated ultimately. Generally, therefore, any forest produce and the tools, boats, vehicles, cattles, etc., used in the commission of the forest offence, which are liable to forfeiture, should not be released. This, however, does not debar the officers and the authorities under the Act including the Appellate Authority to pass appropriate orders under the circumstances of each case but only after assigning valid reasons. The liberal approach in the matter would perpetuate the commission of more offences with respect to the forest and its produce which, if not protected, is surely to affect the mother-earth and the atmosphere surrounding it. The Courts cannot shut their eyes and ignore their obligations indicated in the Act enacted for the purposes of protecting and safeguarding both the forests and their produce. The forests are not only the natural wealth of the country but also protector of human life by providing a clean and unpolluted atmosphere. We are of the considered view that when any vehicle Is seized on the allegation that it was used for committing a forest offence, the same shall not normally be returned to a party till the culmination of all the proceedings in respect of such offence, including confiscatory proceedings, if any. Nonetheless, if for any exceptional reasons a Court is inclined to release the vehicle during such pendency, furnishing a bank guarantee should be the minimum condition. No party shall be under the impression that release of vehicle would be possible on easier terms, when such vehicle is alleged to have been involved in commission of a forest offence. Any such easy release would tempt the forest offenders to repeat commission of such offences. Its casualty will be the forests as the same cannot be replenished for years to come.  [Para 7]"

It is to be noted that Sections 61-A to 61-Q are in force in the State of Maharashtra with effect from 1-6-1985.  Admittedly, the seizure was on 22-4-1988.  In the circumstances, therefore, the entire exercise by the Magistrate and the Sessions Judge under the Code of Criminal Procedure was without jurisdiction and, therefore, ab-initio void.

Act (1992) these forest were managed by appellant earstwhile Ruler of Kutlehar - Appellant in 1995 offered resin blazes to State Forest Corporation and claimed cost of resin tapping for 1995 season - Held, appellant was entitled for his legitimate dues - Question of vesting of forest on or after 11-3-1995 appointed day by H.P. Act (1992) was immaterial - Matter remitted to High Court for fresh consideration.\n\nIn the instant case, Kutlehar was a small princely State in Kangra Hills having 16 Tapas (Tikas) as forests which were known as 'Kutlehar Forests'. These forests were managed by the Raja of Kutlehar subject to the terms and conditions specified by the then Government. By Notification No.4531-FT(CH-58/523 dated 1.10.1958 issued under Section 2(2) of the Forest Act, Raja was appointed as a Forest Superintendent and the employees working under him in the aforesaid forest declared as Forest Officers with respect to Kutlehar Forest. As per the terms of his appointment, he was held entitled to retain 3/4th of the income derivable from the forest where 1/4th of the gross income was payable to the Government.\n\nHeld that, appellant earstwhile Ruler was entitled to his legitimate dues. It cannot be said that in view of S.4 of H.P. Act (1992) the right, title and interest of the plaintiff/appellant herein grantee/superintendent of Kutlehar Forests stood extinguished on the appointed day, i.e. 11.03.1995, therefore, he was under no obligation to continue with the management of the forests nor has any right to share in income arising out of the produce of the said forests on and after 11.03.1995. It is true that after 11.03.1995, the appellant cannot have any right over the forest produce. However, in view of the earlier order Dt.31-3-1999 in Civil Appeal No.9495 of 1995 the passed by Supreme Court clarifying the position and his entitlement, there is no need to go into the vesting right etc. as claimed by the State Government.   [Para 9]\n\nInasmuch as the appellant was continuing as Superintendent of Forests without a specific salary but with an assurance of 3/4th price of forest produce such as resin blazes etc. till the appointed day, i.e. 11.03.1995, the appellant is entitled for his legitimate dues till such date. Those aspects were not being correctly adverted to and appreciated by the single Judge as well as by the Division Bench of the High Court and mainly concentrated on the \"vesting\" of forests on or after 11.03.1995 in favour of the State Corporation by holding that the appellant was not entitled to claim anything thereafter. Even though the appellant placed relevant materials including the assertion and statement of PW-3 who is none else than the Divisional Manager for the State Corporation, those aspects have not been properly appreciated. In those circumstances, ends of justice would be met by remitting the matter to the Single Judge for fresh disposal and quantifying the eligible amount.   [Para 9,10]"

The stumps were of trees illegally cut and stolen.  20 logs without any hammer mark were seized at a Saw Mill.  The petitioner has accepted transportation of timber as per transit pass and therefore the fact that truck was seized more than one month after the illegal transport, does not make any difference.  The contention that material seized at Saw Mill has not been identified with timber carried through the truck of petitioner is also irrelevant because petitioner has accepted transportation of Katsawar which is not included in earlier transit passes.  Petitioner, therefore, also accepts transportation of logs without any hammer mark.  The Saw Mill owner disclosed that excess timber was also brought to his saw mill in same truck.

[Para 6]\n\nIn the transit pass Katsawar timber was not included therefore, it was for petitioner to explain how Katsawar timber came in his possession or truck.  Even if it is presumed that Petitioner was only a transporter, he should have taken precaution to see that logs without hammer mark as required by Rules are not loaded in his truck.  Consequently order of confiscation of Truck was neither perverse nor without jurisdiction.\t [Para 6,9]"

This power can be exercised by the concerned officer if he is satisfied that the said objects were utilized during the commission of a forest offence. A protection is provided for the owners of the vehicles/articles, if they are able to prove that they took all reasonable care and precautions as envisaged under Sub-section (5) of Section 15 of the Adhiniyam and the said offence was committed without their knowledge or connivance. Criminal prosecution is distinct from confiscation proceedings. The two proceedings are different and parallel, each having a distinct purpose. The object of confiscation proceeding is to enable speedy and effective adjudication with regard to confiscation of the produce and the means used for committing the offence while the object of the prosecution is to punish the offender. The scheme Adhiniyam prescribes an independent procedure for confiscation. The intention of prescribing separate proceedings is to provide a deterrent mechanism and to stop further misuse of the vehicle. Thus, High Court as well as the revisional court erred in coming to a conclusion that the confiscation under the law was not permissible unless the guilt of the accused is completely established. \t\t\t\t [Para 24,25,26]"

Considering Section 61G in the light of Section 52(1), the Court is of the considered view that clause quoted as incorporated in Section 61G suffixing the words \"any timber, sandalwood, firewood, charcoal or any other forest produce\" only borrows into this Section, presumptions u/s 69 of the Act.  It distinguishes two types of properties i.e. timber, firewood, charcoal or any other notified forest produce on one hand and tools, boats, vehicles or cattle used for committing offence, on the other hand.  The first category is ordinarily property of the State and second category of the property is ordinarily private property of the alleged offender, used for the purpose of committing an offence.  In view of absence of such clause in Section 52(1), incorporation of the clause in Section 61G does not appear aimed at restricting the scope of bar of jurisdiction to State property only.  Infact, considering the scheme of penalties and procedure as incorporated in Chapter IX of the Act, especially after addition of Sections 61A to 61G, what one can find is that, the chapter envisages two separate trials, one of the offender by the Magistrate and another pertaining to property by \"the authorised officer\". As soon as seizure under Section 52(1) is validly effected, jurisdiction of the Magistrate will be excluded, as far as disposal of the property is concerned.  This is evident from the fact that the powers of the Magistrate regarding disposal of property as incorporated in Sections 55 and 56 of the Act are qualified by clause \"subject to Section 61G\".\n\n1990 Mah.

About 2000 bags of charcoal were confiscated by Revenue authorities. The application for preparing charcoal was made earlier to operating the kiln, but the actual permission was granted by forest officer after the charcoal was already prepared unauthorisedly. Thus the person prefering the charcoal had acted in patent disregard to the Rates and Regulations in that behalf. However, the Revenue authorities had no power and jurisdiction to confiscate the charcoal bags.\n\nThe provisions of sections 44 and 45 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code deal only with the diversion of the land and the use of the land. Those provisions do not, in any manner, arm the Revenue Officers with a power to confiscate such forest produce which have been prepared in contravention of that provision. The contravention might attract some other consequences like recovery of fine etc. The fine so imposed was already paid in the instant case.  [Para 10]\n\nSection 66 of the Forest Act does not confer any power to confiscate the goods. In instant case there is no forest offence registered, nor is there any seizure or confiscation done by any forest officer or police officer. Thus confiscation could not also be justified under Ss.52, 61A of the Forest Act.  [Para 10,11]\n\nThe revenue officers should have been vigilent enough to report the matter to the forest officers and/or to report the matter to th e police. This apathy on the part of the revenue officers is rather intriguing. It seems that the revenue officers have informed the action regarding the confiscation to the Forest Department and more particularly to the Range Forest Officer. It is further intriguing that, that officer should have kept quiet. Had the offences been registered properly, there could have been the confiscation of this forest produce in time saving it from pilferage or from becoming dust, and the guilty could have been brought before the law.

As such, even though teak wood was converted into shutters and frames, it remained to be timber. Moreover, frames and shutters were not complete frames and shutters, they appear to be semi finished frames and shutters. Obviously, the purpose was to carry them under the pretext that it was not forest produce. However, it cannot be ignored that despite converting the teak wood into frames and shutters it was being transported clandestinely at dead hours of night and was removed from the agricultural field where they were concealed under the heap of hay and other useless agricultural material.

It is important to note that such a notice pre-supposes the existence of a forest. The owner of the forest is expected to file objections within a reasonable time as specified in the notice and is also given an opportunity to lead evidence in support of the objections. After these basic requirements are met, the owner of the forest is entitled to a hearing on the objections. This entire procedure obviously cannot be followed by the State and the owner of the forest unless the owner is served with the notice. Therefore, service of a notice issued under Section 35(3) of the Forest Act is inherent in the very language used in the provision and the very purpose of the provision.\n\nSection 35(4) of the Forest Act provides that a notice under Section 35(3) of the Forest Act may provide that for a period not exceeding six months (extended to one year in 1961) the owner of the forest can be obliged to adhere to one or more of the regulatory or prohibitory measures mentioned in Section 35(1) of the Forest Act. On the failure of the owner of the forest to abide by the said measures, he/she is liable to imprisonment for a term upto six months and/or a fine under Section 35(7) of the Forest Act. Surely, given the penal consequence of non-adherence to a Section 35(4) direction in Section 35(3) notice, service of such a notice must be interpreted to be mandatory. If the notice under Section 35(3) of the Forest Act is not served on the owner of the forest, he/she may continue to damage the forest defeating the very purpose of the Forest Act. Such an interpretation cannot be given to Section 35 of the Forest Act nor can a limited interpretation be given to the word \"issued\" used in the context of Section 35 of the Forest Act in Section 2(f) (iii) of the Private Forests Act.\n\nThis double pronged receipt and confirmation of knowledge of the show cause notice by the owner of a forest makes it clear that Section 35(3) of the Forest Act is not intended to end the process with the mere issuance of a notice but it also requires service of a notice on the owner of the forest. The need for ensuring service is clearly to protect the interests of the owner of the forest who may have valid reasons not only to object to the issuance of regulatory or prohibitory directions, but to also enable him/her to raise a jurisdictional issue that the land in question is actually not a forest.\n\nA word has to be construed in the context in which it is used in a statute. By making a reference in Section 2(f)(iii) of the Private Forests Act to 'issue' in Section 35 of the Forest Act, it is clear that the word is dressed in borrowed robes. Once that is appreciated (and it was unfortunately overlooked in Chintamani) then it is quite clear that 'issued' in Section 2(f)(iii) of the Private Forests Act must include service of the show cause notice as postulated in Section 35 of the Forest Act.\n\n2000(2) ALL MR 571 (S.C.) partly overruled.

The statutory provision dealing with issuance of show cause notice, therefore, does not make it obligatory upon the authorities proceeding to take steps for confiscation of the property under the said Act to furnish the copies of such documents to the addressee of the notice along with such notice.  No doubt, this would not mean that the addressee would not be entitled to get copies of such documents in the course of the proceedings.  Certainly, the addressee can insist for supply of such copies in order to facilitate the addressee to defend the case against the claim of confiscation of the property under the said Act. Mere non-supply of such copies along with the show cause notice, however, would not in any manner vitiate the proceedings initiated by the authorities under the said Act for confiscation of the property.  In any case, the petitioner had nowhere made any grievance in reply to the show cause notice that he was in any manner prejudiced by non-supply of such copies or that he was handicapped in filing his reply to the show cause notice on account of non-supply of copies of such documents. Being so, interference in the writ jurisdiction in the impugned order merely on the ground of failure on the part of respondent to supply copies of such documents along with show cause notice is thoroughly uncalled for.

The person from whom such property is seized, cannot as a matter of right insist for return of the property to him even during the pendency of the investigation or proceedings under the said Act in relation to such property.  The question of demand for return of such property after order of confiscation is passed is totally out of question in view of the fact that such property by then vests in the State Government.

Therefore, the decision of the Madhya Pradesh High Court is, in no way, helpful to the petitioner to contend that the proceedings in the case in hand are vitiated on account of non-compliance of section 52(2) of the said Act.  This is not to hold that the authorities are not liable to make report to the Magistrate u/s 52(2).  Certainly, till and until the provision of section 52(2) is on statute book, the authorities are expected to comply with the said provision.  However, in case of failure to comply with the said provision, the proceedings for confiscation cannot be said to be vitiated, though such failure on the part of authorities may warrant some other action against the erring Officers.

Upon a seizure under Section 52(1), the officer effecting the seizure has to either produce the property before the Authorised Officer or to make a report of the seizure under sub-section (2) of Section 52. Upon being satisfied that a forest offence has been committed, the Authorised Officer is empowered, for reasons to be recorded, to confiscate the forest produce together with the tools, vehicles, boats and articles used in its commission. Before confiscating any property under sub-section (3), the Authorised Officer is required to send an intimation of the initiation of the proceedings for the confiscation of the property to the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the offence. Where it is intended to immediately launch a criminal proceeding, a report of the seizure is made to the Magistrate having jurisdiction to try the offence. The order of confiscation under Section 52(3) is subject to an appeal under Section 52-A and a revision under Section 52-B. Subsection (5) of Section 52-B imparts finality to the order of the Court of Sessions in revision notwithstanding anything contained to the contrary in the CrPC and provides that it shall not be called into question before any court. Section 52-C stipulates that on the receipt of an intimation by the Magistrate under sub-section (4) of Section 52, no court, tribunal or authority, other than an Authorised Officer, an Appellate Authority or Court of Sessions (under Sections 52, 52-A and 52-B) shall have jurisdiction to pass orders with regard to possession, delivery, disposal or distribution of the property in regard to which confiscation proceedings have been initiated. Sub-section (1) of Section 52-C has a non obstante provision which operates notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in the Indian Forest Act 1927 or in any other law for the time being in force. The only saving is in respect of an officer duly empowered by the State government for directing the immediate release of a property seized under Section 52, as provided in Section 61. Hence, upon the receipt of an intimation by the Magistrate of the initiation of confiscation proceedings under sub-section (4)(a) of Section 52, the bar of jurisdiction under sub-section (1) of Section 52-C is clearly attracted. The scheme contained in the amendments enacted to the Indian Forest Act 1927 in relation to the State of Madhya Pradesh, makes it abundantly clear that the direction which was issued by the High Court in the present case, in a petition under Section 482 of the CrPC, to the Magistrate to direct the interim release of the vehicle, which had been seized, was contrary to law. The jurisdiction under Section 451 of the CrPC was not available to the Magistrate, once the Authorised Officer initiated confiscation proceedings.\n\n1985 ALLMR ONLINE 528 (S.C.), (2002) 9 SCC 90, (2004) 4 SCC 129, 2017 ALL SCR (Cri) 1253, 2008 ALL SCR 470, (1995) AIR (MP) 1 Ref. to. \t [Para 26]"

Considering the same, the Regulations framed by CERC cannot be given any effect to unless proper enactment is made in this behalf. After considering the provisions of the FCRA and Electricity Act and the Regulations framed thereunder neither of the regulatory authorities will have exclusive jurisdiction to deal with in the futures contract in electricity independently. In view of the above, the provision regarding \"term ahead market\" in the Regulations providing for futures contract or term ahead contract beyond eleven days cannot be made applicable, unless proper enactment in this behalf is made by the Parliament. Till appropriate legislation is enacted by the Parliament, the Regulations framed by the CERC is held to be not applicable so far as futures contract in electricity is concerned. \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 53]\n\nPer Anoop V. Mohta, J.:-\t The Electricity Act deals with in every respect including trading in electricity. The electricity is a non-storable goods, except produced by hydro-projects. The trading of electricity falls within the concept of commodity trading. Therefore, it may or may not physically available all the time, unless generated on the day and/or the date of delivery. This distinguishes electricity as a goods from other commodities as contemplated under the FCR Act, which at present deals exclusively with all aspect of futures/forward contracts. It will not be possible either for FMC or MCX to control and regulate the mandatory requirements of electricity, at various stages, which are well within the exclusive domain and control of the CERC and/or authorities/commissions. It will create more complications than solving it, unless an experts body constituted and specialized rules and regulations are framed. Both authorities/commissions cannot deal in futures/forward contract in electricity excluding other and/or independently. It is not only question of resolving the conflict between two entries and/or mandates of the respective specialized Act, but actual and physical workable solution to permit and/or to allow either authorities/commissions/exchanges to deal with the electricity in the futures/forward market. Both authorities/commissions under the respective Acts may not be in a position to control and regulate the futures contract in electricity exclusively, unless those Acts and regulations are amended/revised and reframed. Both cannot have exclusive jurisdiction as claimed in the present scenario in India. It is clarified that the Union of India and/or the concerned commission and/or the regulatory authorities are free to revise and/or to reframe the rules and the regulations and/or to amend the concerned statutes to permit the futures/forward and derivatives contract in electricity, if so advised. The regulations of CERC as notified on 20th January, 2010, which deals with the aspects of futures contracts or forward contracts, therefore, are inoperative to that extent only. The impugned order dated 28th April, 2009 and order dated 11th January, 2010 upholding the regulations are also unsustainable to the extent of reasoning and direction relates to forward contracts in electricity.

Many freedom fighters, even though they did not have sufficient income to maintain themselves, would even be reluctant to receive the Pension under the Scheme, as they would consider it as putting a price on their patriotism. The spirit of the Scheme being both to assist and honour the freedom fighters and acknowledge the valuable sacrifices made by them, the authorities should treat the applicants with respect and courtesy. The scheme should not be converted into some kind of routine scheme for payment of compensation.\n\n(ii)\tThe persons intended to be covered by the Scheme are those who sacrificed and suffered for achieving the independence of the country, without expecting any reward for their sacrifice and sufferings. Therefore they cannot be expected to maintain and produce perfect records or documents about their participation in the freedom struggle.\n\n(iii)\tOnce the country has decided to honour freedom fighters by granting a pension, the approach of the authorities implementing the scheme should not be obstructionist or technical while examining the applications and documents produced, but be practical having regard to the fact that most of the applications are by old persons with no proper records.\n\n(iv)\tThe criterion for pension under the scheme is not age, but participation in freedom struggle. The freedom fighters pension can, therefore, in exceptional cases, be granted even to those who were minors at the time of struggle, if evidence clearly showed that they had participated in the freedom struggle and fulfilled the requirements of the scheme.  2001(8) SCC 8, 2003(3) SCC 183 - Rel.on.

The order of the State Government is to be examined applying the parameters of judicial review which are available in examining the validity of such orders. Even if order is found to be perverse or flawed, the High Court can, at the most, remit back to the State Government to reconsider the case. However, there may be cases where because of long lapse of time or other circumstances beyond the control of the applicant,it is almost impossible or cumbersome to procure and produce all the stipulated documents. In such cases, the claim cannot be summarily rejected for want of documents, even though as per the Pension Scheme, such documents are to be provided.\n\nOn the basis of evidence/documents/material submitted by the applicant, the Government should examine whether it is a genuine case and the documents produced establish that the applicant had participated in the freedom movement. It should be done applying the principle of probability. If the material/documents produced are otherwise convincing, the Government in appropriate cases may not insist on strict compliance with all the requirements stated in the Scheme. \t\t\t\t\t\t    [Para 19]"
