The commendable objective of the Pension Rule is to extend benefits to a class of people to tide over the crisis and vicissitudes of old age, and if there are some inconsistencies between the statutory provisions and the avowed objective of the statute so as to discriminate between the beneficiaries within the class, the end of justice obligates to palliate the differences between the two and reconcile them as far as possible. Not only the letter but the laudatory spirit of the statutory provisions as also the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 14 of the Constitution of India, have to be considered.\n\n(2004) 4 SCC 412, 2014 ALL SCR 1056, 2012 ALL SCR 2926, (2010) 12 SCC 538, (1994) 2 SCC 521 Disting.\n\n2011(5) ALL MR 380 (S.C.)

Two crucial terms in sub-sections (3) and (5) of S.20 are \"compromise\" and \"settlement.\" The former expression means settlement of differences by mutual concessions. It is an agreement reached by adjustment of conflicting or opposing claims by reciprocal modification of demands. As per Terms de la Ley, \"compromise is a mutual promise of two or more parties that are at controversy.\" As per Bouvier it is \"an agreement between two or more persons, who, to avoid a law suit, amicably settle their differences, on such terms as they can agree upon.\" The word \"compromise\" implies some element of accommodation on each side. It is not apt to describe total surrender. (See Re NFU Development Trust Ltd. (1973)1 All ER 135 (Ch.D). A compromise is always bilateral and means mutual adjustment. \"Settlement\" is termination of legal proceedings by mutual consent. The case at hand did not involve compromise or settlement and could not have been disposed of by Lok Adalat. If no compromise or settlement is or could be arrived at, no order can be passed by the Lok Adalat [Para 7]"

Even sub-section(5) of Section 19 of the said Act makes this aspect of the limitation on the powers of Lok Adalat very clear. a change report, whether contested or not, has to be decided after holding an inquiry in a manner provided in Rule 7 of the Bombay Public Trusts Rules, 1951. No change report can be accepted unless the Assistant Charity Commissioner or Deputy Charity Commissioner, as the case may be, after holding an inquiry, comes to a conclusion that the change as reported has occurred. Sub Section 3 of Section 22 requires findings to be recorded with reasons while disposing of the change reports whether there is a contest or not. The Lok Adalat has no power to make an adjudication by following the procedure which is required to be followed in case of trial of suits. Therefore, the Lok Adalat has no jurisdiction to decide the change report filed under S.22 of 1950 Act on merits. [Para 10,14,15]"

In other words, an eligible person is entitled to legal services at any stage of the proceedings which he or she is prosecuting or defending. In fact the Supreme Court Legal Services Committee provides legal assistance to eligible persons in this Court. This makes it abundantly clear that legal services shall be provided to an eligible person at all stages of the proceedings, trial as well as appellate. It is also important to note that in view of the constitutional mandate of Article 39-A, legal services or legal aid is provided to an eligible person free of cost. Hence the High Court was under an obligation to enquire from accused whether he required legal assistance and if he did, it should have been provided to him at State expense. However, since the record of the case does not indicate any such endeavour having been made by the High Court, this case ought to be re-heard by the High Court after providing accused an opportunity of obtaining legal representation.

Two crucial terms in sub-sections (3) and (5) of Section 20 are \"compromise\" and \"settlement\". The former expression means settlement of differences by mutual concessions. It is an agreement reached by adjustment of conflicting or opposing claims by reciprocal modification of demands. As per Termes de la Ley, \"compromise is a mutual promise of two or more parties that are at controversy\". As per Bouvier it is \"an agreement between two or more persons, who, to avoid a law suit, amicably settle their differences, on such terms as they can were upon\". The word \"compromise\" implies some element of accommodation on each side. It is not apt to describe total surrender. (See Re NFU Development Trust Ltd. (1973)1 All ER 135 (Ch.D). A compromise is always bilateral and means mutual adjustment. \"Settlement\" is termination of legal proceedings by mutual consent. The case at hand did not involve compromise or settlement and could not have been disposed of by Lok Adalat. (2006)8 SCC 364 - Rel. on.\t [Para 7]"

Such institutional mechanisms or arrangements by no stretch of imagination can be said to be contrary to constitutional scheme or against the rule of law. The establishment of Permanent Lok Adalats and conferring them jurisdiction upto a specific pecuniary limit in respect of one or more public utility services as defined in Section 22-A(b) before the dispute is brought before any court by any party to the dispute is not anathema to the rule of law. Instead of ordinary civil courts, if other institutional mechanisms are set up or arrangements are made by the Parliament with an adjudicatory power, such institutional mechanisms or arrangements cannot be faulted on the ground of arbitrariness or irrationality.  [Para 20]\n\nIt is settled law that an authority empowered to adjudicate the disputes between the parties and act as a tribunal may not necessarily have all the trappings of the court. What is essential is that it must be a creature of statute and should adjudicate the dispute between the parties before it after giving reasonable opportunity to them consistent with the principles of fair play and natural justice. It is not a constitutional right of any person to have the dispute adjudicated by means of a court only. Chapter VI-A has been enacted to provide for an institutional mechanism, through the establishment of Permanent Lok Adalats for settlement of disputes concerning public utility service before the matter is brought to the court and in the event of failure to reach any settlement, empowering the Permanent Lok Adalat to adjudicate such dispute if it does not relate to any offence.  [Para 22]\n\nThe alternative institutional mechanism in Chapter VI-A with regard to the disputes concerning public utility service is intended to provide an affordable, speedy and efficient mechanism to secure justice. By not making applicable the Code of Civil Procedure and the statutory provisions of the Indian Evidence Act, there is no compromise on the quality of determination of dispute since the Permanent Lok Adalat has to be objective, decide the dispute with fairness and follow the principles of natural justice. Sense of justice and equity continue to guide the Permanent Lok Adalat while conducting conciliation proceedings or when the conciliation proceedings fail, in deciding a dispute on merit.  [Para 29]"

Appeal is always a creature of statute and if no appeal is provided to an aggrieved party in a particular statute, that by itself may not render that statute unconstitutional. Section 22-E(1) makes every award of the Permanent Lok Adalat under 1987 Act either on merit or in terms of a settlement final and binding on all the parties thereto and on persons claiming under them. No appeal is provided from the award passed by the Permanent Lok Adalat but that, in our opinion, does not render the impugned provisions unconstitutional. In the first place, having regard to the nature of dispute upto a specific pecuniary limit relating to public utility service and resolution of such dispute by the procedure provided in Section 22-C(1) to 22-C(8), it is important that such dispute is brought to an end at the earliest and is not prolonged unnecessarily. Secondly, and more importantly, if at all a party to the dispute has a grievance against the award of Permanent Lok Adalat he can always approach the High Court under its supervisory and extraordinary jurisdiction under Articles 226 and 227 of the Constitution of India.

In short the procedure adopted by Permanent Lok Adalats is what is popularly known as 'CON-ARB' (that is \"conciliation cum arbitration\") in United States, where the parties can approach a neutral third party or authority for conciliation and if the conciliation fails, authorize such neutral third party or authority to decide the dispute itself, such decision being final and binding.

                "description": "Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules (1980), Part III, Rr.941, 946(2) - Bunkers on board a vessel - Cannot be arrested without any claim against vessel and independent of vessel - High Court has no in rem jurisdiction to arrest bunkers on board a ship.\n\nLetters Patent nowhere provides that bunkers can be arrested without any claim against the vessel and independent of the vessel. \"The Letters Patent is a procedural law to facilitate exercise of jurisdiction in aid of a substantive law\". No procedural law can vest jurisdiction which is not provided under substantive law. Though bunkers could be termed necessaries supplied to the vessel, the question herein is not claim against the vessel but it is the claim against the bunker on board with no claim against the vessel and independent of the vessel. Therefore, even if the bunkers supplied are necessaries and for a claim of necessaries, a vessel could be arrested, the same principle cannot be applied to arrest only the bunkers when there is no claim against the vessel and independent of the vessel. \t [Para 8,9]\n\nIf bunkers were property against which the suit could be brought in rem, then the manner of service of writ of summons or warrant of arrest of bunkers would also have been specifically provided not like what the Plaintiff's counsel submitted that if no property other than a ship, cargo or freight could be arrested, the rules would have said so expressly. The rules indicate which are the only properties against which a suit in rem can be brought and bunker is not one of the property. \t [Para 12]\n\nWhilst freight and cargo are considered as maritime property, bunkers are not and hence arrest of bunkers is not permissible irrespective of whether there is a maritime claim or lien against the vessel. Bunkers cannot be considered as maritime property independent of the ship. Bunkers are part of the ship and not capable of independent arrest. In the event the bunkers belong to the charterer against whom the Plaintiff has a maritime claim, the Plaintiff has no remedy by way of arrest of bunkers and the Plaintiff must pursue its claim against the charterer by adopting such other remedies as are available in law. Any alleged lien over the bunkers as provided in the bunker sales contract is of no consequence. It is a contractual lien at best and does not bind a person who is not a party to the contract. This does not give the Plaintiff any right to arrest the bunkers on board the vessel nor does it entitle the Plaintiff to proceed in rem against the bunkers. Arrest of bunkers effectively results in arrest of the ship although there is no claim against the shipowner. Thus the ship owner, who is a third party, is seriously prejudiced and would suffer substantial loss. Ordinarily Courts do not make an order that causes serious prejudice to a third party. In such a situation, the interests of the third party far outweigh the interests of a Plaintiff who is seeking to secure its claim against the buyer of the bunkers. It is also no answer for the Plaintiff's counsel to say in such a situation that it will provide appropriate undertakings to compensate the ship owner for detention of its vessel or that it is open to the ship owner to recover charter hire from the charterer for the period the vessel is detained due to an order of arrest of bunkers. \t [Para 21,24]"

Thus, the facts constituting the adverse possession must be of such nature that the property in possession of the person claiming adversely, must be the property belonging to others and a person in possession claims a right to own the said property. That means, the possession must be with an intention or with an animus to own the said property with a hostility to the true owner. Thereby it becomes necessary that the possession with the person must be of such nature that it gives caution to the true owner of the property that if he does not take steps for obtaining possession, then the person in possession claiming adversely will mature his title into ownership. The person claiming adverse possession will also have to point out as to since when i.e. at what point of time, he started claiming possession adversely to the real owner and further will have to satisfy that even though his possession was of such nature that it cautioned the real or true owner of the property to take steps for obtaining possession, he remained into possession of the property uninterruptedly, peacefully, without any obstruction from the true owner of the property. Therefore the concise statement of material facts constituting plea of adverse possession are necessary.

It further does not point against which of the owner the possession was being claimed as adverse possession. An omnibus plea that as against the whole world his possession was adverse, can not be said to be a plea of adverse possession. Defendants have not pleaded material facts which give sufficient notice to the true owner of the property that the defendants are claiming possession over the property adversely to the true owner of the property.

Thus, the facts constituting the adverse possession must be of such nature that the property in possession of the person claiming adversely, must be the property belonging to others and a person in possession claims a right to own the said property. That means, the possession must be with an intention or with an animus to own the said property with a hostility to the true owner. Thereby it becomes necessary that the possession with the person must be of such nature that it gives caution to the true owner of the property that if he does not take steps for obtaining possession then the person in possession claiming adversely will mature his title into ownership. The person claiming adverse possession will also have to point out as to since when i.e. at what point of time, he started claiming possession adversely to the real owner and further will have to satisfy that even though his possession was of such nature that it cautioned the real or true owner of the property to take steps for obtaining possession, he remained into possession of the property uninterruptedly, peacefully, without any obstruction from the true owner of the property.

For instance, when the wrong is complete as a result of the act or omission which is complained of, no continuing wrong arises even though the effect or damage that is sustained may enure in the future. What makes a wrong, a wrong of a continuing nature is the breach of a duty which has not ceased but which continues to subsist.

Undoubtedly such legal assistance cannot be thrusted upon the accused person against his Will. Nevertheless proper reading of Rule 4 above in its entirety would disclose that it is not sufficient for the Sessions Court merely to inquire at the time of recording of the plea as to whether he would like to avail the legal assistance. Even in a case where the accused person declines to avail the legal assistance while recording the plea in an answer to the charge framed in a Sessions Case, if in the course of the recording of the evidence the accused remains unrepresented, or is found to be without any legal assistance, certainly it is the duty of the Sessions Court to enquire as to whether the accused needs any legal assistance to be provided in terms of the said rules read with Section 304, Cr.P.C. Failure on the part of the Sessions Judge in this regard would certainly result in denial of statutory right guaranteed to the accused person in a Sessions Case. Besides, result of denial of legal assistance would also result in violation of constitutional mandate under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The fact that the Sessions Judge has taken due precaution in that regard and has duly complied with the provisions of law relating to the legal aid to the unrepresented accused must be apparent from the records.

A judicial pronouncement, either declaratory or conferring rights on the citizens cannot be set at naught by a subsequent legislative act for that would amount to an encroachment on the judicial powers. However, the legislature would be competent to pass an amending or a validating act, if deemed fit, with retrospective effect removing the basis of the decision of the Court. Even in such a situation the courts may not approve a retrospective deprivation of accrued rights arising from a judgment by means of a subsequent legislation. However, where the Court's judgment is purely declaratory, the courts will lean in support of the legislative power to remove the basis of a Court judgment even retrospectively, paving the way for a restoration of the status quo ante. Though the consequence may appear to be an exercise to overcome the judicial pronouncement it is so a normal adjunct of the legislative power. The whole exercise is one of viewing the different spheres of jurisdiction exercised by the two bodies i.e. the judiciary and the legislature. The balancing act, delicate as it is, to the constitutional scheme is guided by well defined values which have found succinct manifestation in the views of Supreme Court in Bhaktwar Trust & Ors., (2003) 5 SCC 298.\n\n If the principles enunciated therein are to be applied to the present case what follows is that Section 41(6) to (9) introduced in the Principal Act by the Goa State Amendment renders ineffective Clause 4(viii) of the Agreement executed by the parties under Section 41 of the Principal Act. With Clause 4(viii) being deleted the embargo on constructions on the acquired land is removed. It is the aforesaid Clause 4(viii) and its legal effect, in view of Section 42, that was the basis of the Court's decision dated 20th January, 2009 holding the construction raised by the third respondent on the acquired land to be illegal and contrary to the Principal Act. Once Clause 4(viii) is removed the basis of the earlier judgment stands extinguished. In fact, it may be possible to say that if Clause 4(viii) had not existed at all, the judgment of the Court dated 20th January, 2009 would not have been forthcoming. It was therefore well within the domain of the legislature to bring about the Amendment Act with retrospective effect, the Legislative field also being in the Concurrent List, namely, Entry No. 42 of List III (Acquisition and Requisition of Property) of the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution. \t [Para Pars24,25]"

Section 41 of the Principal Act and the terms of the agreement executed thereunder (even if the latter is understood to be 'Law' enacted by the competent legislature for the purpose of Article 254) are silent with regard to modification/variation or deletion/subtraction of the terms of the agreement. The State Amendment Act by bringing in Sub-sections (6) to (9) of Section 41 invalidates a clause of the agreement [Clause 4(viii)] by effecting a deletion thereof with retrospective effect i.e. 15.10.1964 (the date of coming into operation of the Principal Act to the State of Goa). The State Amendment, by no means, sets the law in a collision course with the Central/Principal enactment. Rather, it may seem to be making certain additional provisions to provide for something that is not barred under the Principal Act. Moreover, if the provisions of the State Amendment are to be tested on the anvil of the finding of this Court that the acquisition in the present case is under Section 40(1)(aa) of the Land Acquisition Act, the deletion of the relevant clause of the agreement as made by the said amendment may appear to be really in furtherance of the purpose of the acquisition under the Central Act. Therefore, there is no repugnancy between the Principal Act and the State Amendment. \t [Para 28]"

The issue before the Constitution Bench was not relatable to any award as such passed after the amended date.\n\n In K.S.

Paripoornan (II) case, it is not found that the three-Judge Bench decision runs counter to the authority in the Constitution Bench. It also does not give a different interpretation to Section 30(2) that what has been stated by the Constitution Bench. In fact, K.S. Paripoornan (II) clearly postulates about the awards that have been passed by the court after the Act has come into force which is in consonance with the ratio laid down in Raghubir Singh's case.

Thus, the controversy with which the three- Judge Bench was dealing with was absolutely different and the view expressed by it is absolutely in accord with the principles laid down in Raghubir Singh's case.

The definition of the \"Appropriate Government\" in Section 3(ee) nowhere relates to the ownership of land. It relates to the \"purpose\" for which the acquisition is sought to be made. When the land is sought to be acquired for the purpose of Union, in those cases the Appropriate Government to take initial decision about the need of the land for public purpose will be the Central Government and in cases of any other purpose, the Appropriate Government to take decision in that regard would be the State Government. Being so, the Section 3(ee) of the said Act has no reference to the ownership of the land which is required to be acquired under the said Act, and hence, the said definition of the expression \"Appropriate Government\" can be of no help to the claimants to contend that once the land belongs to the Central Government then the State Government who initiates the acquisition proceedings by issuing notification under Section 4 of the said Act, the jurisdiction of the reference court would not be barred to deal with the issue of title of the property as the claim of ownership of land is by the Central Government and not by the Appropriate Government. Undoubtedly, the term \"appropriate government\" is used in the said Act referring to the government which commences and conducts the land acquisition proceedings under the said Act. It makes no difference as far as the issue of ownership of land as such. It is to be noted that though in relation to the procedure for acquisition of land under the said Act from the issuance of notification declaring intention to acquire the land till the approval of the award by the government, the term used is the \"appropriate government\", on conclusion of such proceedings, the end result of acquisition as provided under Section 16 is that the land so acquired \"..........thereupon vests absolutely in the Government........\". The vesting of land acquired under the said Act is in the \"government\" and it is not specified as to whether it is in the State Government or Central Government, nor it is restricted to the appropriate government. The term \"government\" has not been defined under the said Act. The General Clauses Act, 1897, Sec.3(23) defines the term \"government\" to include both the Central Government and any State Government. Therefore, the ownership of land acquired or to be acquired can be either of the Central Government or any State Government, it does not make any difference. The arguments based on the said term \"appropriate government\" sought to be advanced are of no help to the claimants.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 40]"

Similarly, Sub-section (2) of Section 9 requires individual notices requiring them to disclose their claim in respect of all types of interests. It is the contention on behalf of the claimants that all types of interests would mean the interest of ownership. There can hardly be any quarrel about this proposition. However, whether in a given case such interest would also mean the interest of ownership or not will depend upon the facts of that case. As it does not prohibit the Government to acquire limited interest in the land already belonging to the Government, in such cases the question of entertaining the claim of ownership by interested persons could not arise at all. The interested persons in such cases cannot enlarge the scope of jurisdiction of the reference court under the said Act. Such interested persons cannot seek adjudication of their claim of ownership right in the land in such proceedings because the scope of adjudication depends upon the subject matter of acquisition. The provisions of Section 9 notice and the notice issued thereunder therefore are of no help to the claimants to contend that the jurisdiction of the reference Court in the case in hand would extend to decide the issue of ownership of land. Query in the notice under Section 9 as to what is the interest that is claimed or what is the compensation that is claimed by the claimants would not enlarge the scope of the inquiry in the reference proceedings and such queries would obviously relate to the subject matter of the acquisition.

The material produced on behalf of the Union of India and the Corporation to show that the terms and conditions of service of the employees in several other undertakings in the public sector compared unfavourably to those of the Corporation employees was not conclusive. But the burden of establishing hostile discrimination was on the petitioners who challenged the Amendment Act and the rules. It was for them to show that the employees of the Life Insurance Corporation and the employees of the other establishments to whom the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act were applicable were similarly circumstanced to justify the contention that by excluding the employees of the Corporation from the purview of the Industrial Disputes Act they had been discriminated against.

The policy stated here is at least as clear as the one held in Harishanker Bagla's case offering sufficient guidance to the Central Government in exercising its powers under that Act. Further, S. 48 (3) of the Life Insurance Corporation Act requires that every rule made by the Central Government under this Act shall be laid before each House of Parliament and that if both Houses agree in making any modification in the rule or both Houses agree that the rule should not be made, the rule shall thereafter have effect only in such modified form or be of no effect, as the case may be. This makes it perfectly clear that Parliament has in no way abdicated its authority, but is keeping strict vigilance and control over its delegate. Therefore the Amendment Act of 1981 and the Rules framed by Central Govt. subsequent to such Amendment cannot be held to be invalid on the ground of excessive delegation of legislative functions.

                "description": "Application of S.14 - Appellant can seek exclusion of time under S.14 of Limitation Act - S.35 of FEMA, held, does not exclude application of S.14 of Limitation Act.\n\nSection 29(2) of the Limitation Act, 1963 prescribes that where any special or local law prescribes for any suit, appeal or application, a period of limitation different from the time prescribed by the Schedule, the provisions of Section 3 shall apply as if such period were the period prescribed by the Schedule and for the purposes of determining the period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by any special or local law, the provisions contained in Sections 4 to 24 shall apply only in so far as, and to the extent to which, they are not expressly excluded by such special or local law. Now Section 35 of the FEMA provides firstly, a specific period of limitation of sixty days for filing an Appeal before the High Court. Secondly, Section 35 empowers the High Court to allow the Appeal to be filed within a further period not exceeding sixty days if it is satisfied that the Appellant was prevented by a sufficient cause from filing the Appeal within the original period of sixty days. In view of this provision, section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 would not empower the High Court to condone the delay for a period in excess of what is stipulated by the proviso to Section 35. Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963, however, does not provide for an extension of the period of limitation. Section 14 deals with the exclusion of time taken in a proceeding bona fide in a Court without jurisdiction. Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 does not extend the period of limitation but relates to the exclusion of a certain period while computing the period of limitation. Undoubtedly the provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 would stand excluded and the power of the High Court to condone a delay occasioned beyond the period specified by the proviso to Section 35 would be excluded by virtue of the specific statutory provision. But merely because the provision of Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 are rendered inapplicable that would not result in an inference that the provisions of Section 14 would not apply. That is simply because Section 14 is not a provision which confers upon the Court a power to condone the delay for sufficient cause but a provision by which a certain period has to be excluded in computing the period of limitation. Hence, there is absolutely no reason or justification for the Court to infer that Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 cannot be applied in relation to the proceedings before the High Court in an Appeal under Section 35 of the FEMA. Section 35 of the FEMA does not in any event expressly exclude the application of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963.\n\n\n2008(6) ALL MR 423 (S.C.) Rel.on.  [Para 7]"

It is a complete code in itself. Precisely, but in its entirety the said Act deals with the process and the proceedings relating to the subject of gratuity payable by the employer to its employees. All the relevant and material provisions of law to determine the said subject covering the aspect of its determination, including the process of adjudication of all disputes relating thereto with finality attached to the decision in respect thereof with all necessary checks by authoritative review of the decision thereunder, it prescribes complete procedure for the proceedings thereunder. Besides, the scheme of the said Act reveals that the liability regarding the payment of gratuity is to be determined in accordance with the method prescribed under the said Act and should be paid as soon as it becomes payable otherwise, the employer incurs further liability of payment of interest as well being subjected to prosecution, besides penalty. The scheme, therefore, clearly indicates the intention of the Legislature to compel the employer to clear the liability regarding the gratuity as soon as it becomes due and payable, failure of which would invite penalty and prosecution for the employer. This obviously would disclose the need for speedy disposal of the matter including those at the appellate stage under the said Act and certainly in time bound framed programme. \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 16]\n\nConsidering the phraseology of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act, undoubtedly, there is presumption about its applicability to special Acts in case of such special Act being silent about its exclusion. But the presumption would stand rebutted once the provision relating to limitation and restriction on power of extension thereof being specifically provided under a special statute. Merely because a special statute is silent on the subject, that by itself would not lead to a presumption about exclusion of Section 29(2) or for that matter Section 5 of the Limitation Act. Nevertheless, when the phraseology of the relevant provision in the special statute inevitably indicates the intention of the Legislature to exclude by necessary implication the applicability of the provisions of law contained under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, it would amount to making violence to the statutory provision to construe it to the contrary. To read the concept of unlimited extension of period of limitation by filing appeal under the said Act in the said proviso to Section 7(7) of the said Act would virtually amount to supplement the said proviso by Section 5 of the Limitation Act which is clearly impermissible.

In that event there was nothing that prevented the judgment debtors from adopting proceedings under Section 9 of the said Act earlier to prevent the consequences under the said Act. The delay of almost four years in filing the present Notice of Motion is neither warranted nor justified. During this period of four years, the rights of the general body of creditors have intervened. An application for condonation of delay in filing such proceedings cannot take into consideration merely the rights and liabilities of the judgment debtor and the person at whose instance the Insolvency Notice is issued, or the original and substituted petitioning creditors who are no longer interested in proceeding with the matter for any reason. The Court must also consider the effect of such applications being allowed on all the other creditors who are entitled to rely upon and act on the basis of the act of insolvency for it is their rights which are invoked. In the present case the grant of any orders would unnecessarily protract the proceedings as far as such other parties are concerned, entirely due to the default of the judgment debtors. For instance, the intervenor viz. Kaushik Shah Shares & Securities Pvt. Ltd. has itself been prosecuting this matter after substitution for almost two years. There is no reason to exercise Court's discretion in condoning the delay. The same would only further delay the entire proceedings by compelling other creditors to adopt independent proceedings. There is also the possibility in some cases of the claims being barred by limitation. There is also the possibility of some of the creditors not being able to adopt insolvency proceedings, as they may not be maintainable. In any event, it would involve an unfair protraction of litigation and multiplicity of proceedings as far as the general body of creditors are concerned.

Acknowledgment is given before the expiry of period of limitation since time was extended under the signature.\n\nAssuming for the sake of argument that there was no acknowledgment before the expiry of period of limitation and the cheque is issued after a period of expiry of limitation, still whether there is an enforceable liability or not will have to be considered.  The cheque is issued under the signature of the debtor after putting the sum payable.  The cheque directs the bank to pay the bearer sum mentioned in the cheque.  As such it becomes the promise in favour of the payee within the meaning of Section 25(3) of the Indian Contract Act.  Once it becomes a fresh promise, fresh period of limitation of 3 years would begin to run from the date of cheque.  Hence the liability would certainly be a legally enforceable liability.\n\nWhen a drawer revalidates cheque from time to time which is permissible, it could be said that on each occasion there was a fresh promise as envisaged by Section 25 of the Contract Act as well as an acknowledgment within the meaning of Section 18 of the Limitation Act if such revalidation is made within the period of limitation.

Transfer of Property Act (1882), S.3.\n\nThe Court, in applying the period of limitation, would first inquire as to whether any time was fixed for performance of agreement of sale.  If it is so fixed, the suit must be filed within the period of three years, failing which the same would be barred by limitation.  Here, however, no time for performance was fixed.  It was for the Courts to find out the date on which the plaintiff had notice that the performance was refused and on arriving at a finding in that behalf, to see whether the suit was filed within three years thereafter. [Para 11]\n\nThe 1st Defendant was a friend of the 2nd Defendant. Admittedly, the usual stipulations were knowingly not made in the agreement of sale dated 11-4-1983.  The 1st Defendant may or may not be aware about the agreement entered by and between the respondent herein.  But he cannot raise a plea of absence of notice of the deed of sale dated 4-9-1985, which was a registered document. Possession of the suit land by the appellant also stands admitted.  Registration of a document as well as possession would constitute notice, as is evident from Section 3 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.   [Para 13]\n\nAdmittedly, father-in-law and wife of the Respondent No.1 had been looking after his affairs. They were, therefore, acting as his agents.  They would be deemed to have notice of the registration of the document as also the possession of the appellant herein.  If they had the requisite notice, the Respondent No.1., having regard thereto, should have filed a suit for specific performance of contract within the prescribed period. In fact they should have done so expeditiously having regard to the discretionary nature of relief he may obtain in the suit. They did not do so. They waited for more than two years from the date of execution of deed of sale.  Even if the suit was not barred by limitation on that account, it was a fit case, where the Court should have refused to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction under Section 20 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963. 2006(4) ALL MR (S.C.) 110 and 2006(3) ALL MR (S.C.) 85 - Ref to.

As the Corporation would be in a position to know as to whether there is a shortfall or there is excess amount realised, only after the sale of the mortgage/ hypothecated assets. This is clear from the language of sub-Section (1) of Section 29 which makes the position abundantly clear. Merely because the Corporation acted under Section 29 of the Act, did not mean that the contract of indemnity came to an end. Section 29 merely enabled the Corporation to take possession and sell the assets for recovery of the dues under the main contract. It may be that only the Corporation taking action under Section 29 and on their taking possession they became deemed owners. The mortgage may have come to an end, but the contract of indemnity, which was an independent contract, did not. The right to claim for the balance arose, under the contract of indemnity, only when the sale proceeds were found to be insufficient. The right to sue on the contract of indemnity arose after the assets were sold. The present case would fall under Article 55 of the Limitation Act, 1963 which corresponds to old Articles 115 and 116 of the old Limitation Act, 1908. The right to sue on a contract of indemnity/ guarantee would arise when the contract is broken. Therefore, the period of limitation is to be counted from the date when the assets of the Company were sold and not when the recall notice was given.\n\n2006(3) ALL MR 196 (S.C.), 2007 ALL SCR 2954 Ref.

Plaintiff claiming that on 14th December, 2011 he came to knowledge that defendant refused to perform their part of contract and suit is filed within three years from said date therefore is within limitation.

It was only on the basis of a legal fiction that the proceedings under Section 31 are treated as akin to execution proceedings. There is no decree to be executed nor there is any decree-holder or judgment-debtor and, therefore, in a strict sense it cannot be said to be a case of execution of a decree. Article 136 of the Limitation Act has no application in the facts of the present case. Article 136 specifically uses the words \"decree or order of any civil court\".

If a written instrument is void ab initio, a suit for getting such a declaration from the Court of competent jurisdiction is not required to be filed, and even if such instrument remains outstanding, a plea that such instrument is void can be raised anywhere in any proceedings by way of defence and the bar of limitation to raise such challenge would not arise. In a suit based on title claiming the relief of possession, any written instrument putforth in defence considered to be void, need not be challenged and the limitation for filing such a suit would be of twelve years from the date when it becomes adverse to the plaintiff and it shall be governed by Article 65 of the Limitation Act. But this is not true in a case where a written instrument operating against a person is voidable. It has to be necessarily challenged within a period of limitation of three years, as prescribed by Article 59 of the Limitation Act and the period of limitation starts running from the date when such an instrument first become known to him.\n\n\tThe burden of proof that the suit filed is within a period of limitation, is upon the plaintiffs, who have come before the Court to get the same set aside or cancelled. It is not the case of plaintiffs that these sale-deeds were obtained from Laxmibai by practising misrepresentation and/or fraud. The challenge to the sale-deeds cannot be said to be on the ground of voidness. In the present case, the sale-deeds at Exhibits 74, 76 and 78 are covered by Section 41 of the Transfer of Property Act and the transactions become voidable at the instance of the plaintiffs. It is not the pleading in the plaint that the plaintiffs filed the suit challenging the sale-deeds, within a period of three years from the date of their knowledge about execution of such sale-deeds. This is also not the evidence brought on record by the plaintiffs. On the contrary, the evidence brought on record and the findings recorded in earlier paras clearly establish the knowledge of the plaintiffs about the possession of the defendants and the execution of sale-deeds on 4-6-1974, 13-4-1976 and 19-7-1976 itself. These instruments stand as insurmountable obstacle and binds them. In fact, they have made a prayer for setting aside these instruments. The limitation is, therefore, governed by Article 59 of the said Act and the suit should have been brought within a period of three years, as contemplated by Article 59 of the Limitation Act, from the date of knowledge of these sale-deeds to the plaintiffs. The suit filed on 11-2-1986 was, therefore, clearly barred by the law of limitation, as prescribed under Article 59 of the Limitation Act. \t [Para 42,46]"

                "description": "Special Court - Attachment of property of notified person - Limitation Act has no application.\n\nThe Limitation Act, 1963 is applicable only in relation to certain applications and not all applications despite the fact that the words \"other proceedings\" were added in the long title of the Act in 1963. The provisions of the said Act are not applicable to the proceedings before bodies other than Courts, such as quasi-judicial tribunal or even an executive authority. The Act primarily applies to the civil proceedings or some special criminal proceedings. Even in a Tribunal, where the Code of Civil Procedure or Code of Criminal Procedure is applicable; the Limitation Act, 1963 per se may not be applied to the proceedings before it. Even in relation to certain civil proceedings, the Limitation Act may not have any application. As for example, there is no bar of limitation for initiation of a final decree proceedings or to invoke the jurisdiction of the Court under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure or for correction of accidental slip or omission in judgments, orders or decrees; the reason being that these powers can be exercised even suo motu by the Court and, thus, no question of any limitation arises.   [Para 33]\n\nThe proceedings before the Special Court are extraordinary in nature. Distribution of the assets of a notified person may take a long time but it would bear repetition to state because all the claims filed before the Special Court are disposed of, the property of the notified person stands attached. In other words, the provisions of the Limitation Act would inter alia apply only when a suit is filed or a proceeding is initiated for recovery of an amount and not where a property is required to be applied towards the claims pending before the tribunal for the purpose of discharge of the liabilities of the notified person in terms of Section 11 of the said Act.   [Para 37]\n\nA Special Court having regard to its nature and functions may be a Court within the meaning of Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 or Section 3 of the Limitation Act, 1963 but having regard to its scope and object and in particular the fact that it is a complete code in itself; the period of limitation provided in the schedule appended to the Limitation Act, 1963, will have no application.   [Para 38]\n\nOnce the statutory operation relating to the attachment of the property belonging to a notified person comes into being, the duties and functions of the Special Court start. In relation to the duties and functions required to be performed by a Court of law, no period of limitation need be prescribed. Furthermore, Section 13 of the said Act provides for a non-obstante clause which has been used as a device to modify the ambit of provisions of law mentioned therein or to override the same in the specified circumstances. The said Act does not provide for any period of limitation, the reasons wherefor have been noticed hereinbefore and in that view of the matter. Articles 19, 28 and 55 providing for period of limitation prescribed would have no application. Section 13 of the said Act provides for a non-obstante clause which is of wide amplitude. In a case of conflict between the said Act and any other Act, the provisions of the former shall prevail. [Para 39]\n\nA statute of limitation bars a remedy and not a right. Although a remedy is barred, a defence can be raised. In construing a special statute providing for limitation, consideration of plea of hardship is irrelevant. A special statute providing for special or no period of limitation must receive a liberal and broader construction and not a rigid or a narrow one. The intent and purport of the Parliament enacting the said Act furthermore must be given its full effect. Hence the provisions of the Limitation Act have no application, so far as directions required to be issued by the Special Court relating to the disposal of attached property; are concerned.  \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 41]"

In other words nothing shall be deemed to be done bonafide or in good faith which is not done with due care and diligence.  The expression sufficient cause has necessarily to be a cause which is beyond the control of the party seeking condonation of delay.  The existence of sufficient cause being a condition precedent for exercise of discretion for condonation of delay by the Court, in the absence of such sufficient cause being shown, the delay in preferring the appeal cannot be condoned.  A bald statement on the part of the applicant that he thought it fit not to file the appeal on account of comprehensive suit already filed by him cannot at all be stated to be a sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal either within the prescribed period or beyond it till he obtained legal advice.  [Para 6]\n\nThe plea that delay was due to some settlement talk between the parties could not be accepted.  Since the settlement talks had not even commenced before the expiry of the period of limitation and they were initiated only after the expiry of limitation period, the point relating to the settlement talks cannot be in a way considered to be even a cause for non-filing of the appeal before the expiry of the period of limitation.  That apart, it is the case of the applicant himself that he had filed comprehensive suit claiming several reliefs and, therefore, he thought that there was no need of filing the appeal.  [Para 6]\n\nIn the instant case, the applicant has neither shown sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal even after obtaining certified copy of order within the period of limitation prescribed for filing the appeal nor has justified the delay caused thereafter in filing the appeal.  The applicant has also stated on oath that he has already filed a comprehensive suit claiming for several reliefs and as such the applicant bonafide thought there was no need of filing an appeal against the impugned order.  In this set of facts there is no sufficient cause made out for condoning the delay of 182 days.  [Para 16]"

As a matter of law on passing of the preliminary decree in respect of house property declaring shares of respective parties, the suit for partition had not come to an end. The proceedings for drawing the final decree after passing of the preliminary decree in the suit for partition is continuation of suit. In a suit for partition of immoveable property or separate possession of a share therein which is not assessible to the payment of revenue, if the partition or separation cannot be conveniently made without further enquiry, the court only passes preliminary decree declaring the rights of parties and it is the duty of the Court which passes the preliminary decree to proceed for drawing the final decree. This course can be exercised by the Court either suo motu or on a application by a party. Article 137 of the Limitation Act cannot be applied to such exercise. The final decree of partition by metes and bounds having not been passed, the decree had not yet become enforceable and, therefore, Article 136 of Limitation Act has no application and the limitation prescribed under Article 136 of the Limitation Act has not even begun to run. The Appeal Court, therefore, was right and rather fully justified in holding that the application made by the respondents herein on 17th November, 1978 is an application in the nature of prayer to the Court to draw final decree and, therefore, rightly set aside the order of the Civil Judge and remanded the matter back to the said Court for proceeding further with the said application for drawing the final decree.

We find number of cases in which it is laid down that whenever inspite of objection by defendants on the ground of non-joinder, the period of limitation was allowed to expire, it would be too late to join such necessary parties to the suit and the only course is to dismiss the suit itself. It may be noted that it is not a case of mis-description of parties, but non-joinder of the parties and after 30 years it would be unjust and improper to allow addition of the legal representatives of Govindrao Padalkar as parties to the present suit.\n\nThe proviso to sub-section (1) of Section 21 enacts that where the court is satisfied that the omission to include a new plaintiff or defendant was due to bona fide mistake, the suit as regards such plaintiff or defendant \"shall be deemed to have been instituted on any earlier date\". The proviso thus mitigates the rigour of law in appropriate cases.\n\nA further question may still arise as to whether the addition of a party after the period of limitation would affect the suit as regards other parties who are already on record. That would depend upon whether the party sought to be added is a necessary or proper party to the suit. If he is a necessary and has not been joined within the period of limitation, the suit will have to be dismissed, the reason being that the suit could be said to be a properly constituted suit only when the necessary party was joined in the suit but, by that time, the suit had already been time barred. But if the party is only a proper party, as distinguished from a necessary party, the suit as regards the other parties would not be barred since the suit which had already been instituted was legal and proper. Court is not satisfied that the mistake, in not joining Govindrao Padalkar or his legal representatives by plaintiff from 1977 till this date, is made in good faith. It is deliberate omission. There are no bona fides. The discretion given in the proviso cannot be exercised in favour of the appellant/plaintiff.

The only question, therefore, that is to be considered is whether the city civil court suit was prosecuted with due diligence and in good faith. Order VII Rule 6 of Civil Procedure Code provides that where a suit is instituted after the period of limitation, the plaint must show the grounds upon which the exemption from such law is claimed. Admittedly, when the present suit was filed the Plaintiffs did not plead any ground claiming exemption of any period in computing the period of limitation laid down by the law of limitation.\n\nEven the plaint which is returned by one court having no jurisdiction to entertain the suit is presented in the same condition to the court having the jurisdiction, it amounts to institution of fresh suit and there is no question of continuation of the earlier suit.

Therefore, this situation also to the conclusion that when the plaintiff/respondent attended the hearing of the counter claim filed by the revision applicants herein, there was no reason in not prosecuting the suit filed by the respondent. Not only that the suit was dismissed in default but the application which was filed for restoration of the suit with a prayer for condonation of delay was also dismissed for want of prosecution and thereafter belatedly after 5 years 9 months and 18 days, another application is filed for condonation of delay and for restoration of the suit. When the court realised that there was no 'sufficient cause' disclosed in the application for condonation of delay, the court had no unlimited and unbridled discretion to condone the delay by merely observing that in the interest of justice delay deservesd to be condoned. Therefore, if the facts of the case are considered in its entirety, in the light of the provisions of Order IX rule 9 of Code of Civil Procedure and also section 141 of Code of Civil Procedure and even the provisions of section 5 of the Limitation Act, there is no doubt that Court has exceeded the jurisdiction and for unsustainable reasons in law condoned the delay. Therefore, within the scope of revisional jurisdiction under Section 115 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the interference in the impugned judgment and order is warranted. Accordingly judgment impugned and order set aside. \t\t\t\t\t\t     [Para 15,16,17]"

What is material in such circumstance is to examine whether there was any gross delay with malafide intention on the part of such Applicant to deliberately approach the Court belatedly. In fact, on perusal of the reply filed by the Respondents, there are no malafides attributed to the Appellant. There is no cogent evidence on record to show that the Appellant had knowledge of the proceedings initiated by the Respondents before the learned Lower Appellate Court. In such circumstances and in the interest of justice, the learned Judge was not justified to dismiss the Application for condonation of delay and set aside the ex-parte decree passed in the Appeal preferred by the Respondents. No doubt, Article 11 of the Code of Communidade permits the summons to the Administrator of the Comunidade but in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case and taking note of the fact that the Respondents themselves chose to serve the attorney of the Communidade before the Trial Court which was stated to be registered address of the Appellant before the Trial Court, it was not open to the Respondents to change such address and serve the Administrator in the Appeal preferred against the Appellant herein.

A reading of an isolated para in the written statement, by the trial court on the facts of this case has been correctly commented upon adversely by the High Court in the judgment under appeal. The original written statement read as a whole unmistakably indicated that the defendant had not accepted the plaintiff's title. Secondly, while allowing the amendment, the High Court in its earlier judgment dated 28th March, 2002 had expressly remanded the matter to the trial court, allowing the defendant to raise the plea of limitation. The right to sue for declaration of title first arose on the facts of the present case on 16th May, 1990 when the original written statement clearly denied the plaintiff's title. By 16th May, 1993 therefore a suit based on declaration of title would have become time-barred. It is clear that the doctrine of relation back would not apply to the facts of this case for the reason that the court which allowed the amendment expressly allowed it subject to the plea of limitation, indicating thereby that there are no special or extraordinary circumstances in the present case to warrant the doctrine of relation back applying so that a legal right that had accrued in favour of the defendant should be taken away.\n\n2011 ALL SCR 2540 Rel.on. \t     [Para 29]"

Therefore when an appeal against ex parte decree was dismissed as time barred by rejecting application for condonation of delay the petition under O.9, R.13 of the Code would not lie in view of the filing of an appeal against the decree by the appellant and the dismissal of the appeal though for default, since a dismissal for default or on the ground of it being barred by limitation cannot be equated with a withdrawal of the appeal.

The Legislation in its wisdom has mandated dismissal of the suit. It could have also said that in such cases plaint be rejected. The fact that it makes use of the word dismiss is by itself eloquent. Necessarily, therefore, if the suit is apparently barred by limitation, the suit has to be dismissed. This is necessary because the rejection of plaint does not prohibit a party from filing a fresh suit as envisaged by rule 13 of Order 7 of C.P.C. Therefore, when once court records a finding that suit is barred by limitation and dismisses it, the lis comes to an end while where a plaint is rejected the lis does not come to an end. Where, therefore, a plea of limitation is raised, the court cannot reject the plaint but may dismiss it on framing a preliminary issue. The judge of the trial court has rightly rejected the application under Order 7, Rule 11 of C.P.C. There is, therefore, no substance in the revision and the same is dismissed.  [Para 10,11]"

The important words in the said clause are \"barred by law\". The words barred by law have to be interpreted in the sense the suit itself could not be filed in the civil court i.e. where the civil court inherently lacks jurisdiction and certain law prohibits it from taking cognizance of the suit. Where, therefore, a mere plea of limitation is raised; it could not be said that the suit is barred by law. The law of limitation cannot prevent a party from instituting a suit in civil court. But there are certain laws which prevent the suit being instituted in the civil court, for that law, makes a provision of alternate remedy and forum. If a person wants to get an industrial dispute resolved, which is essentially a civil dispute, such a person cannot approach civil court, since Industrial Disputes Act makes remedy and forum available and therefore, civil court in such cases will inherently lack jurisdiction. The law of limitation, therefore, does not prohibit a party from approaching the civil court and filing a suit even though it may be barred by limitation. While dealing with the question, Court has to bear in mind the difference between rejection of a plaint and the dismissal of a suit. The plaint is rejected because it is found to be defective for the reasons mentioned in Rule 11. Though not in every case, generally the defective plaint is rejected by the court at the threshold. The court refusing to take cognizance can reject the plaint. Where plaint is rejected, a party has a right to present a fresh plaint but where a suit is dismissed, no party has a right to present a fresh suit on the same cause of action."

Court would therefore have to determine at trial whether cause of action is within limitation or is barred. Where legislature has contemplated that plaint can be amended at any stage of proceedings as stipulated in provisos to S. 21(5), 21(2). Such amendment of nature contemplated by those provisions can indeed be brought about at any stage of proceedings.\n\nApplication for amendment filed by plaintiffs is not barred by limitation. Judgement of Single Judge allowing amendment would not operate to cause any prejudice to Appellant so as to constitute judgment within meaning of Cl. 15 of Letters Patent.Necessary consequence would be that appeal against order of Learned Single Judge would not constitute judgment under Cl.15 of Letters Patent.\n\n2012(4) ALL MR 628, 2004 (8) SCC 569, AIR 1982 SC 818, AIR 1992 SC 1604, 1983 Mh.L.J. 369, 1981 (4) SCC 8, 1974 (2) SCC 387 Ref. to. \t\t \t   [Para 11]"

                "description": "Setting aside abatement - Delay in applying - Principles applicable in considering application stated.\n\nThe principles applicable in considering applications for setting aside abatement may thus be summarized as follows :\n\n(i)\tThe words \"sufficient cause for not making the application within the period of limitation\" should be understood and applied in a reasonable, pragmatic, practical and liberal manner, depending upon the facts and circumstances of the case, and the type of case. The words 'sufficient cause' in section 5 of Limitation Act should receive a liberal construction so as to advance substantial justice, when the delay is not on account of any dilatory tactics, want of bonafides, deliberate inaction or negligence on the part of the appellant.\n\n(ii)\tIn considering the reasons for condonation of delay, the courts are more liberal with reference to applications for setting aside abatement, than other cases. While the court will have to keep in view that a valuable right accrues to the legal representatives of the deceased respondent when the appeal abates, it will not punish an appellant with foreclosure of the appeal, for unintended lapses. The courts tend to set aside abatement and decide the matter on merits, rather than terminate the appeal on the ground of abatement.\n\n(iii)\tThe decisive factor in condonation of delay, is not the length of delay, but sufficiency of a satisfactory explanation.\n\n(iv) The extent or degree of leniency to be shown by a court depends on the nature of application and facts and circumstances of the case. For example, courts view delays in making applications in a pending appeal more leniently than delays in the institution of an appeal. The courts view applications relating to lawyer's lapses more leniently than applications relating to litigant's lapses. The classic example is the difference in approach of courts to applications for condonation of delay in filing an appeal and applications for condonation of delay in refiling the appeal after rectification of defects.\n\n(v)\tWant of 'diligence' or 'inaction' can be attributed to an appellant only when something required to be done by him, is not done. When nothing is required to be done, courts do not expect the appellant to be diligent. Where an appeal is admitted by the High Court and is not expected to be listed for final hearing for a few years, an appellant is not expected to visit the court or his lawyer every few weeks to ascertain the position nor keep checking whether the contesting respondent is alive. He merely awaits the call or information from his counsel about the listing of the appeal.  [Para 8]"

(See: Samar Singh Vs. Kedar Nath and others, (1987) Supp. SCC 663). One more category of suits which may be added to - where leave of the Court or some authority is mandatorily required to be obtained before the institution and was not so obtained. [Para 22]"

Parties were therefore very well aware as to property in respect of which application for possession has been filed by petitioner under O.21 R.95.  Omission to mention boundaries of Western and Southern Side can only be attributed to inadvertence on part of petitioner. In view of fact that parties were well aware as to in respect of which property execution proceedings were filed as also application for handing over possession, amendment of description of property in said application can therefore hardly cause any prejudice to Respondents. It is further required to be noted that respondents have also raised objection as regards description of property only in year 2012. Executing Court has proceeded on premise that provisions of O.6 R.17 would be applicable. Further held that application for amendment filed in year 2012 was filed beyond limitation and therefore could not be allowed.\n\nExecuting Court has erred in proceeding on premise that O.6 R.17 of C.P.C. would be applicable. O.6 R.17 applies to amendment of pleading, and cannot apply to execution proceedings and more so in respect of application for possession which has been filed in which through inadvertence description of property in so far as 2 boundaries are concerned is omitted.  Power that is to be exercised by Executing Court is inherent power under S.151 and power to permit amendment under S.153 of C.P.C. Power under S.153 to permit petitioner to correct boundaries in application for possession of property required to be exercised as it would lead to travesty of justice as petitioner who has decree in favour passed as long back as in year 1974 and also Sale Certificate dated 10/3/1980 would be deprived of possession of property on ground of mere technicality. \t\t     [Para 16]"

It is also clear that unless applicability of Section 5 of the said Act of 1963 is expressly excluded, it cannot be said that Section 5 will not have any application.  It is no doubt true as held by the Apex Court in the recent case of Union of India Vs. M/s. Popular Construction Co., express exclusion may follow from the scheme and objects of the special or local law.  In case of Prakash Jain relied upon by the learned counsel for the Petitioner, while considering the scheme of Section 43 of the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999 and especially the consequences prescribed by the Section itself for not making application for leave to defend within a period of 30 days, the Apex Court has taken view that applicability of Section 5 of the said Act of 1963 is excluded.  However, on the basis of the view taken by the Apex Court after examining the scheme of Section 43 of the Act of 1999, one cannot jump to the conclusion that applicability of Section 5 of the said Act of 1963 is excluded in so far clause 21 of the Rent Control Order is concerned.  If the entire scheme of the Rent Control Order is examined there is nothing to show that the applicability of Section 5 of the said Act of 1963 is intended to be excluded.  Infact, in sub-clause (i) of Clause 21 a provision has been made for excluding time required for obtaining copy of the Order of the Rent Controller.  In the case of Prakash Jain relied upon by the learned counsel for the petitioner, the Apex Court was considering the scheme and scope of a provision which is altogether of a different nature.  In the present matter the question is as regards the Appeal under Clause 21 of the Rent Control Order.  Considering the scheme of the Rent Control Order the Division Bench of this Court in the case reported in Babasaheb Kedar Vs. Additional Collector has come to the conclusion that applicability of Section 5 of the said Act of 1963 is not excluded in case an appeal is preferred under Clause No.21. Court does not agree with the submissions of the learned counsel for the Petitioner that the law laid down by the Division Bench of this Court is no longer a good law in the light of the case of Prakash Jain.  Therefore, the said argument advanced by the learned counsel for the Petitioner is rejected. 2004(5) ALL MR 1 (S.C.) - Distinguished. 2000(3) ALL MR 90 - Rel. on.\t [Para 11]"

The date on which the Complainant becomes eligible to get the amount of insurance policy is the date on which the cause of action commences i.e. the date on which he suffered loss. It is well-settled principle of law that cause of action once commences to run, it never stops. No doubt Limitation Act, 1963 contains the provisions which provide for stopping of cause of action even though it commenced when the person who is supposed to file a suit suffers from a disability, namely, minority and/or mental disability. However, in that event also the cause of action starts to run from the date on which disability is removed. However, said provision has not been incorporated under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.  [Para 7]\n\nClause (b) of Article-44 of the Limitation Act, 1963 provides for period of limitation of three years and in last column it states when the period of limitation starts to run. As per this article period of limitation starts to run from the date of occurrence causing the loss, or where the claim on the policy is denied, either partly or wholly, the date of such denial. Therefore, this provision provides that the limitation starts from the date of denial of the claim by the Insurance Company. However, this Article is not applicable to Section 24- A of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986. It is applicable to the civil suits to be filed in the Civil Court. No doubt Section-3 of the Consumer Protection Act, 1986 specifically states that provisions of the said Act are not in derogation of but are in addition to the provisions of existing laws but it is to be noted that the remedy available under this Act is a summary remedy. A full-fledged remedy of the Civil Court is available under the law to the Complainant instead of choosing the remedy under the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.\n\nIII (2009) CPJ 75 (SC) Ref. to.

In law, when time begins to run, it can only be extended in the manner provided in the Limitation Act.

The Commission being a statutory tribunal, cannot act beyond the four walls of the Electricity Act also does not brook any exception. However, the Electricity Act 2003 requires a further scrutiny to find out whether by virtue of Section 175 of the Electricity Act or otherwise it can be inferred that the provisions of Limitation Act will govern or curtail the powers of the Commission in entertaining a claim under Section 86(1) (f) of the Electricity Act. [Para 32]\n\nA statutory authority like the Commission is also required to determine or decide a claim or dispute either by itself or by referring it to arbitration only in accordance with law and thus Section 174 and 175 of the Electricity Act assume relevance. Since no separate limitation has been prescribed for exercise of power under Section 86(1)f) nor this adjudicatory power of the Commission has been enlarged to entertain even the time barred claims, there is no conflict between the provisions of the Electricity Act and Limitation Act to attract the provisions of Section 174 of the Electricity Act. In such a situation on account of provisions in Section 175 of the Electricity Act or even otherwise the power of adjudication and determination or even the power of deciding whether a case requires reference to arbitration must be exercised in a fair manner and in accordance with law. In the absence of any provision in the Electricity Act creating a new right upon a claimant to claim even monies barred by law of limitation, or taking away a right of the other side to take a lawful defence of limitation, in the light of nature of judicial power conferred on the Commission, claims coming for adjudication before it cannot be entertained or allowed if it is found legally not recoverable in a regular suit or any other regular proceeding such as arbitration, on account of law of limitation. Have taken this view not only because it appears to be more just but also because unlike Labour laws and Industrial Disputes Act, the Electricity Act has no peculiar philosophy or inherent underlying reasons requiring adherence to a contrary view. Evidently, in absence of any reason or justification the legislature did not contemplate to enable a creditor who has allowed the period of limitation to set in, to recover such delayed claims through the Commission. Hence a claim coming before the Commission cannot be entertained or allowed if it is barred by limitation prescribed for an ordinary suit before the civil court. But in appropriate case, a specified period may be excluded on account of principle underlying salutary provisions like Section 5 or 14 of the Limitation Act. Such limitation upon Commission on account of this decision would be only in respect of its judicial power under clause (f) of sub-section (1) of Section 86 of the Electricity Act, 2003 and not in respect of its other powers or functions which may be administrative or regulatory.

                "description": "Appeal u/S.127 of Electricity Act - Condonation of delay - S.29(2) of Limitation Act, whether applicable - S.29(2) becomes applicable in two contingencies - Firstly that there must be a provision for period of limitation under any special or local law in connection with any suit, appeal or application - Secondly that when said special or local law prescribes period of limitation for an appeal or application for which there is no provision in Schedule to Limitation Act - Language of S.127 satisfies said tests - Hence, S.29(2) would be applicable to proceeding u/S.127 of Electricity Act.\n\n\tSection 29 of the Limitation Act becomes applicable in two contingencies that there must be a provision for period of limitation under any special or local law in connection with any suit, appeal or application; and secondly when the said special or local law prescribes the period of limitation for an appeal or application for which there is no provision in the Schedule to the Limitation Act. In such cases all the provisions of Sections 4 to 24 of the Limitation Act would become applicable.\n\n\tThe special laws can be carved out into two categories, one category of special laws are those where the Appeal provision lays down a period of limitation couched in a peremptory or imperative language which as held by the Apex Court is not sufficient to displace the applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act and the 2nd category is of those special laws where on account of the language used in the Appeal provision the applicability of the limitation Act is ruled out or are those special laws where the applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act is specifically excluded.\n\n\tIn the instant case, the Appeal is under a provision namely Section 127 of the Electricity Act. The said Appeal lies against the final assessment order passed by the Assessing Officer. The language of Section 127 of the Electricity Act stands in contradistinction to the language of Section 125 of the Electricity Act. The scheme encompassed within the said two provisions is therefore different. Though Section 127 is couched in a peremptory or imperative manner, Sections 5 to 24 of the Limitation Act would have to be applied for determining the period of limitation to file an Appeal under the said provision, though the Electricity Act is held to be a special law. Having regard to the tests laid down for applicability of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act which have already been adverted to herein above, the said tests can be said to have been satisfied in so far as the applicability of Section 29(2) to a proceeding under Section 127 of the Electricity Act is concerned.\n\n\tBy holding that Section 29(2) would be application to a proceeding under Section 127 of the Electricity Act, the Court has construed Section 127 of the Electricity Act is different than Section 125, though both are part of the same special law. Support for the same can be drawn from the judgment of the Apex Court in The Member, Board of Revenue's case [AIR 1956 SC 35].\n\n\tIn the said case, the Apex Court was concerned with the provisions of the Indian Stamp Act and especially the issue as to under which provision the document in question therein was exigible to stamp duty. The provisions in question were Sections 4 to 6 of the Indian Stamp Act. The Apex Court held that the topics dealt with by the 3 Sections above being different no useful purpose would be served by referring to Section 4 or Section 6 of the Indian Stamp Act for determining the scope of Section 5 or for construing its terms, as in the said case, the legislature has used three different words in relation to the three sections \"transaction\" in Section 4, \"matter\" in Section 5, and \"description\" in Section 6. Same is the case with Section 125 and Section 127 of the Electricity Act. The language of the said provisions is different and they provide for an Appeal against different orders. Therefore, the applicability of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act to a proceeding under Section 127 of the Electricity Act cannot be ruled out and the period applicable for filing an Appeal would therefore have to be necessarily construed keeping in mind Sections 5 to 24 of the Limitation Act.\t [Para 8,14]"

If these goods are not cleared by the purchaser/owner/consignee, the Port Trust can sell the goods and recover port trust charges. Sections 61 and 62 of the Major Port Trusts Act lay down the procedure for sale of the cargo. It is also laid down that in the event of the amount recovered from the sale of cargo is not sufficient to recover the port trust charges, in that event the Port Trust has a right to recover the said amount by filing a suit. It is evident, therefore, that as long as the goods are not actually sold the Trust would not be in a position to calculate the exact deficit which has to be recovered from the owner. It is possible that after selling the cargo, the entire amount may be recovered towards the port trust charges in which event there would be no necessity for the Port Trust to file a suit for recovery of any amount from the owner. However, it is found that even after the cargo, the sale proceeds of the cargo may not be sufficient for the purpose of making payment of the port trust charges. It is only at that time the Port Trust would be in a position to know the exact deficit which has to be recovered from the owner. The date on which, therefore, in this case, the Port Trust became aware of the deficit is the date of sale viz. 08/12/1986. In the present case, suit is filed on 07/12/1989 i.e within three years from the date of sale of the cargo which took place on 8/12/1986 is thus not barred. AIR 1979 Bombay 12 - Rel. on.

None of the provisions relating to the exercise of powers of revision i.e. from Section 405 specifically provide for any period of limitation within which such an application is required to be made.  In so far as the Sessions Judge's powers of revision are concerned, the same are provided under section 399 of the code, which are coextensive with those of High Court, and it does not provide for any period of limitation, and therefore one should have no doubt in his mind that the prescribed period of limitation for filing a Criminal Revision Application will be governed by Article 131 of the Limitation Act, and Section 5 of the said Act will enable the court to admit the application after the expiry of period of limitation on sufficient cause being shown for condonation of delay.  As the bar of limitation provided under section 3 of the Limitation Act is to be exercised subject to the provisions contained in sections 4 to 24 (inclusive) and therefore the contrary view taken by the Sessions Judge is without application of mind and contrary to law. [Para 7]\n\nIn the application, the revisionist stated that upon receipt of the certified copy, the applicant has handed over the certified copy to the clerk of the counsel, under an impression that it will be handed over to the counsel representing him for preferring the revision.  But the said clerk did not do so, which resulted in non filing of the revision.  The applicant did make queries with the counsel, but he was informed that the certified copy was not traceable and it is only when the certified copy is traced out he filed a revision application which was after delay of 19 days.  In the circumstances it could not be said that the delay was due to negligence or inaction on the part of the applicant, and therefore, the High Court is inclined to condone the delay on imposing certain conditions.\t\t\t [Para 18]"

                "description": "Appeal against acquittal by victim - Period of limitation - Held, in a police case, limitation for filing appeal would be 90 days - Whereas in a complaint case, limitation period would be 60 days from grant of leave by Court.\n\n\tThe right to appeal conferred upon the victim by adding proviso to the substantive provision of Section 372 of CrPC, clearly provides that no appeal shall lie from any judgment and order to a Court except as provided for by the CrPC. The right of the victim, therefore, is subject to the limitation and leave of the Court provided under Section 378 against acquittal.\t [Para 25]\n\n\tSection 378, does not use the word 'victim'. Sub-sections (4) and (5) thereof, deal with a right of appeal against the order of acquittal on behalf of the complainant and, that too, on an application made to the High Court seeking special leave to appeal and once the leave is granted, the complainant can present the appeal to the High Court. The application seeking leave, as provided for under sub-section (5), insofar as the complainant as defined under Section 2(d), has to be filed within a period of 60 days from the date of the order of acquittal. Sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) of Section 378, speak only about the right of the State Government or the Central Government to file an appeal against the order of acquittal, with the leave of the High Court. Thus, it is clear that Section 378, though directly does not confer any right on the victim, the Supreme Court in Satya Pal Singh [2015 ALL SCR 3523], held, in view of the peculiar language employed in Section 372, that even if the victim, when files appeal against the order of acquittal in State prosecution case, requires to make an application to seek the leave of the High Court to file an appeal. Similarly, since it is not in dispute that the State can file an appeal with the leave of the High Court against the order of acquittal within a period of 90 days, the same limitation would apply in case of appeal by the victim arising from State prosecution, obviously taking recourse to Article 114 of the Limitation Act.\n\n\tThus, from the scheme of the provisions of Section 378, it is clear that two streams of appeals against acquittals are provided. The first stream of appeals is against the order of acquittals to be preferred by the State Government/Central Government and the same would be under sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 378 and before such an appeal is entertained, a leave of the High Court requires to be taken, as provided for under sub-section (3) of Section 378. The other stream of appeals is against the order acquittals in the complaint case, wherein, by virtue of Section 378 (4), the complainant has to seek special leave to appeal from the High Court under sub-section (5). Further, the application for grant of special leave to appeal must be filed if the complainant is a public servant within 6 months from the date of order of acquittal and in all other cases, within 60 days from the date of order of acquittal. For the first stream of appeals under sub-sections (1) and (2) read with sub-section (3) of Section 378, no limitation is provided under Section 378 or any other Section of CrPC and, hence, the period of limitation for filing the appeal under Section 378(1) and (2) of CrPC is 90 days from the date of the order appealed from, as provided for in Article 114(a) of the Limitation Act. Though it is with reference to Section 417 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898, that equally applies to Section 378 (1) and (2), as has been held by the Supreme Court in Dharam Pal Singh's case [AIR 2001 SC 2924]. In that case, the Supreme Court observed that appeals by the State Government or the Central Government continue to be governed by Article 114 (a) of the Limitation Act. In other words, those appeals must be filed within 90 days from the date of the order appealed from. It is needless to state that if there is a delay in filing an appeal by the State Government or the Central Government, it would be open to them to file an application under Section 5 of the Limitation Act for condonation of such delay. Thus, that period can be extended if the Court is satisfied that there was sufficient cause for not preferring the appeal within a period of 90 days. In this backdrop, when we have a close look at the provisions contained in Section 372, it leaves no manner of doubt that the limitation as provided for the State Government/Central Government appeals under Section 114(a) of the Limitation Act would apply for filing of an appeal by the victim. In any case, the limitation provided under sub-section (5) of Section 378 has no application when the appeal is filed by the victim being his substantive right after the proviso came to be added to Section 372 by Act 5 of 2009 with effect from 31.12.2009. Sub-section (4) and sub-section (5) do not deal with the right of the victim in a State prosecution.\n\n\tTherefore, the limitation for preferring an appeal against the order of acquittal by the victim would be 90 days in all cases, other than the cases instituted upon complaint, and 60 days for any case instituted upon complaint against the order of acquittal after the High Court grants special leave to appeal. 2014 CrLJ 1046 Held Not Good Law in view of 2015 ALL SCR 3523. 2002 ALL MR (Cri) 185 (S.C.), 2010 ALL SCR 1085, 2015 ALL SCR 3523 Rel. on.

Section 13(1)(l) of the Bombay Rent Act provides that a landlord shall be entitled to recover possession of any premises if the Court is satisfied that a tenant after coming into operation of the Bombay Rent Act, has built acquired vacant possession of or being allotted a suitable residence. Under section 13(1)(l) of the Bombay Rent Act, a tenant forfeits his protection and the right to remain in possession of the tenanted premises if he acquires suitable residence. The forfeiture takes place on the date on which the tenant acquires suitable residential premises. Consequently, the period of limitation would be required to be counted from the date of forfeiture, i.e. the date of acquisition of the suitable residential premises. That would be the starting point for computing the period of limitation for filing of the suit for possession. As the petitioner forfeited his right to remain in possession of the suit premises in the year 1970-71 when he acquired the suitable residential premises, the suit filed on 29th April 1987 was clearly barred by limitation.

Act, not a court so as to be able to invoke powers for condonation of delay u/s.5 of Limitation Act.\n\nSection 29(2) of the Limitation Act prescribes that the provisions of Sections 4 to 24 of the Limitation Act would also apply to the proceedings under a special or local law, which prescribe a period of limitation in respect of any suit, appeal or application, different from the period prescribed under the Limitation Act, only with the substitution of such period, for the period prescribed in the Schedule to the Limitation Act for the corresponding proceeding.  Likewise, there is no dispute about the proposition that for ousting the applicability of the Limitation Act, it is necessary to show that these provisions were expressly excluded by the special or local law, or excluded by necessary implication, as held by the Supreme Court in Mukri Gopalan Vs. Cheppilat Puthanpurayil Aboobacker, reported at AIR 1995 SC 2272.  It is, therefore, not necessary to refer to the decisions which deal with the question of applicability of the provisions of the Limitation Act to proceedings under a special or local law.  In fact the learned Single Judge in his judgment under appeal has categorically observed in para 7(G) that there was no such express or implied exclusion of the provisions of the Limitation Act under the Bombay Prohibition Act.  The learned Judge held that if the Collector was held to be a 'Court', then the Limitation Act would apply and the Collector would have the powers under Section 5 of the Limitation Act to condone delay. The question of applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act would have to be decided with reference to the question as to whether the authority concerned could be called a 'Court'.\n\nHearing of appeals under Section 137 or revision under Section 138 of the Bombay Prohibition Act may be quasi judicial acts, but still they retain the character of acts by the executive authorities.  An authority would be a 'court' if it were holding scales between entities other than itself.  Since no person could be a judge in his own cause, a Collector, who has the duty to collect revenue, does not become a court merely because he re-appraises or re-examines the demands raised by his subordinates.  Exercise of powers by the authorities in the legislative or executive wing of the State may follow procedure similar to exercise of adjudicatory power by the judicial organs of the State, when these authorities are by statute required to act judiciously.  They may be required to receive submissions, ascertain the points in controversy, receive evidence and adjudicate upon rights of persons before them, but still such exercise would not come within the purview of exercise of judicial powers of the State.  The acts concerned may be in the zone of penumbra where both judicial and executive functions may meet, but would not qualify for being classified as exercise of judicial power of the State.  It may also be mentioned that the learned Single Judge in para 5(L) of his judgment has taken a review of the provisions of the Bombay Prohibition Act.  He pointed out that the Collector does not have the power to summon or examine any witness in exercise of appellate or revisional authority and that his powers are basically in the nature of administrative supervision. Appeals under the Civil Services Rules or proceedings before the Legislatures for breach of privilege or disqualification of Members are instances of proceedings, which are decidedly judicial, but still do not amount to exercise of judicial power of the State, since such power is not vested in the authorities concerned.\n\nThe Collector hearing the appeal under Section 137 of the Bombay Prohibition Act was not a Court so as to be able to invoke powers for condonation of delay under 5 of the Limitation Act.

                "description": "Section 107 cannot revive extinguished right/claim - Suits for possession of properties barred under Art 134-B of Limitation Act, 1908 - Right of Wakf to suit properties hence stood extinguished in view of S.27 of Limitation Act, 1963 - Such extinguished rights are not revived by S.107.\n\nSection 107 lays down that nothing contained in the Limitation Act, 1963 shall apply to any suit for possession of immovable property comprised in any Wakf or for possession of any interest in such property. Thus it can be said that this section virtually repeals the Limitation Act, 1963 so far as the Wakf properties are concerned. Therefore, it can be concluded without any hesitation in mind that there is now no bar of limitation for recovery of possession of any immovable property comprised in a Wakf or any interest therein.  It is well settled that no statute shall be construed to have a retrospective operation until its language is such that would require such conclusion. The exception to this rule is enactments dealing with procedure. This would mean that the law of limitation, being a procedural law, is retrospective in operation in the sense that it will also apply to proceedings pending at the time of the enactment as also to proceedings commenced thereafter, notwithstanding that the cause of action may have arisen before the new provisions came into force. However, it must be noted that there is an important exception to this rule also. Where the right of suit is barred under the law of limitation in force before the new provision came into operation and a vested right has accrued to another, the new provision cannot revive the barred right or take away the accrued vested right.   [Para 22]\n\nSection 107 provides that nothing in the Limitation Act, 1963 would apply to any suit for possession of immovable property, comprised in any Wakf or for any interest in such property. Therefore, for the application of Section 107, on 1st of January, 1996, the property must be comprised in the Wakf or the Wakf must have some interest in such properties. If however, the right to property stands extinguished, then Section 107 cannot apply. In the present case, as noted herein earlier, the trial court had held that the suits were barred under Article 134-B of the Limitation Act, 1908 and, therefore, since the suits were barred under the 1908 Act, in view of Section 31 of the Limitation Act, 1963, Article 96 of the 1963 Act could not be applied. Section 31 was overlooked by the first appellate court. Therefore, when the right stood extinguished, Section 107 cannot have the effect of reviving the extinguished right/claim.

Section 2(j) of the 1963 Act when read in the context of Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act, it becomes amply clear that the prescribed period for making an application for setting aside arbitral award is three months.

                "description": "Application for setting aside award - Limitation - Provisions of S.14 would be applicable to the fullest extent but not S.5 - Time taken for diligently pursuing remedy in wrong Court can be excluded.\n\nPer, J. M. Panchal, J.:-\tWhen any special statute prescribes certain period of limitation as well as provision for extension upto specified time limit, on sufficient cause being shown, then the period of limitation prescribed under the special law shall prevail and to that extent the provisions of the Limitation Act shall stand excluded.  As the intention of the legislature in enacting sub-section (3) of Section 34 of the Act is that the application for setting aside the award should be made within three months and the period can be further extended on sufficient cause being shown by another period of 30 days but not thereafter, the provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act would not be applicable because the applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act stands excluded because of the provisions of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act. However, merely because it is held that Section 5 of the Limitation Act is not applicable to an application filed under Section 34 of the Act for setting aside an award, one need not conclude that provisions of Section 14 of the Limitation Act would also not be applicable to an application submitted under Section 34 of the Act of 1996. [Para 26,27]\n\nUpon the words used in section 14, it is not possible to sustain the interpretation that the principle underlying the said section, namely, that the bar of limitation should not affect a person honestly doing his best to get his case tried on merits but failing because the court is unable to give him such a trial, would not be applicable to an application filed under Section 34 of the Act of 1996.  The principle is clearly applicable not only to a case in which a litigant brings his application in the court, that is, a court having no jurisdiction to entertain it but also where he brings the suit or the application in the wrong court in consequence of bona fide mistake or law or defect of procedure.  Having regard to the intention of the legislature this Court is of the firm opinion that the equity underlying Section 14 should be applied to its fullest extent and time taken diligently pursuing a remedy, in a wrong court, should be excluded.  \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 28]\n\nIf the period between the commencement of the arbitration proceedings till the award is set aside by the court, has to be excluded in computing the period of limitation provided for any proceedings with respect to the dispute, there is no good reason as to why it should not be held that the provisions of Section 14 of the Limitation Act would be applicable to an application submitted under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 more particularly where  no provision is to be found in the Act of 1996, which excludes the applicability of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, to an application made under Section 34 of the Act.  It is to be noticed that the powers under Section 34 of the Act can be exercised by the court only if the aggrieved party makes an application.  The jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Act, cannot be exercised, suo motu.  The total period of four months within which an application, for setting aside an arbitral award, has to be made is not unusually long.  Section 34 of the Act of 1996 would be unduly oppressive, if it is held that the provisions of Section 14 of the Limitation Act are not applicable to it, because cases are no doubt conceivable where an aggrieved party, despite exercise of due diligence and good faith, is unable to make an application within a period of 4 months.  From the scheme and language of Section 34 of the Act of 1996, the intention of the Legislature to exclude, the applicability of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, is not manifest.  It is well to remember that Section 14 of the Limitation Act does not provide for a fresh period of limitation but only provides for the exclusion of a certain period.  Having regard to the legislative intent, it will have to be held that the provisions of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 would be applicable to an application submitted under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 for setting aside an arbitral award.   [Para 29]\n\nPer R. V. Raveendran, J.:- The Limitation Act applies only to proceedings in court, and but for the express provision in section 43, the Limitation Act would not have applied to arbitration, as Arbitrators are Private Tribunals and not courts. Section 43 of the AC Act, apart from making the provisions of Limitation Act, 1963 applicable to arbitrations, reiterates that Limitation Act applies to proceedings in court.  Therefore, the provisions of Limitation Act, 1963 apply to all proceedings under the AC Act, both in court and in arbitration, except to the extent expressly excluded by the provisions of the AC Act.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 8]\n\nSection 5 of Limitation Act does not place any outer limit in regard to the period of extension, whereas the proviso to sub-section 3 of section 34 of the AC Act places a limit on the period of extension of the period of limitation. Thus the proviso to sub-section 34(3) of the AC Act is also a provision relating to extension of period of limitation, but differs from section 5 of the Limitation Act, in regard to period of extension, and has the effect of excluding section 5 alone of the Limitation Act. On the other hand, Section 14 contained in Part III of Limitation Act does not relate to extension of the period of limitation, but relates to exclusion of certain period while computing the period of limitation. Neither sub-section (3) of section 34 of the AC Act nor any other provision of the AC Act exclude the applicability of section 14 of the Limitation Act to applications under section 34(1) of the AC Act. Nor will the proviso to section 34(3) exclude the application of section 14, as section 14 is not a provision for extension of period of limitation, but for exclusion of certain period while computing the period of limitation. Having regard to section 29(2) of Limitation Act, section 14 of that Act will be applicable to an application under section 34(1) of the AC Act. Even when there is cause to apply section 14, the limitation period continues to be three months and not more, but in computing the limitation period of three months for the application under section 34(1) of the AC Act, the time during which the applicant was prosecuting such application before the wrong court is excluded, provided the proceeding in the wrong court was prosecuted bona fide, with due diligence.  2006(6) SCC 239 - Rel.on.

Section 34(3) is a limitation provision, which is an inbuilt into the remedy provision. One does not have to look at the Limitation Act or any other provision for identifying the limitation period for challenging an Award passed under Part I of the Arbitration Act.\n\n(b) \tThe time limit for commencement of limitation period is also provided in Section 34(3) i.e. the time from which a party making an application \"had received the Arbitral Award\" or disposal of a request under Section 33 for corrections and interpretation of the Award.\n\n(c) \tSection 34(3) prohibits the filing of an application for setting aside of an Award after three months have elapsed from the date of receipt of Award or disposal of a request under Section 33. Section 34(3) uses the phrase \"an application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed\". The phrase \"may not be made\" is from the UNCITRAL Model Law and has been understood to mean \"cannot be made\".\n\n(d) \tThe limitation provision in Section 34(3) also provides for condonation of delay. Unlike Section 5 of Limitation Act, the delay can only be condoned for 30 days on showing sufficient cause. The crucial phrase \"but not thereafter\" reveals the legislative intent to fix an outer boundary period for challenging an Award.\n\n(e) \tOnce the time limit or extended time limit for challenging the arbitral award expires, the period for enforcing the award under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act commences. This is evident from the phrase \"where the time for making an application to set aside the arbitral award under Section 34 has expired\". There is an integral nexus between the period prescribed under Section 34(3) to challenge the Award and the commencement of the enforcement period under Section 36 to execute the Award.\t\n\n\tIf Section 17 of the Limitation Act were to be applied to determining the limitation period under Section 34(3), it would have the following consequences :-\n\n(a) \tIn Section 34(3), the commencement period for computing limitation is the date of receipt of award or the date of disposal of request under Section 33 (i.e correction/additional award).\n\n\tIf Section 17 were to be applied for computing the limitation period under Section 34(3), the starting period of limitation would be the date of discovery of the alleged fraud or mistake. The starting point for limitation under Section 34(3) would be different from the Limitation Act.\n\n(b) \tThe proviso to Section 34(3) enables a Court to entertain an application to challenge an Award after the three months period is expired, but only within an additional period of thirty dates, \"but not thereafter\". The use of the phrase \"but not thereafter\" shows that the 120 days period is the outer boundary for challenging an Award. If Section 17 were to be applied, the outer boundary for challenging an Award could go beyond 120 days. The phrase \"but not thereafter\" would be rendered redundant and otiose. This Court has consistently taken this view that the words \"but not thereafter\" in the proviso of Section 34 (3) of the Arbitration Act are of a mandatory nature, and couched in negative terms, which leaves no room for doubt.\t  [Para 35]\n\n\tIn view of, the aforesaid inconsistencies with the language of Section 34(3) of Arbitration Act tantamount to an \"express exclusion\" of Section 17 of Limitation Act.\n\n2010 ALL SCR 2248, 2012 ALL SCR 969, 2018 ALL SCR 1054 Ref. to  [Para 36]"

                "description": "Recovery of loan payable with interest on demand - Limitation - Extension of by payment - When principal and interest are due, payment towards interest or principal extends period of limitation for both.\n\nA Comparison of sub-section 1 of Section 20 of the 1908 Limitation Act as amended in the year 1942 and the provisions of Section 19 of the Limitation Act, 1963 shows that the provisions are identical and therefore, the provisions of unamended Section 20 of Limitation Act, 1908 and the provisions of Section 20 after its amendment in the year 1942 becomes relevant  to consider what is the meaning to be attached to the term \"a debt\" used in Section 19 of the Limitation Act, 1963. It, thus, becomes clear that initially Section 20 made a clear distinction, so far as extension of period of limitation is concerned, between the payment made towards principal and payment made towards interest. Perusal of the provisions of sub-section 1 of Section 20 of the Limitation Act, 1908, as amended in the year 1942, shows that the distinction made between payment made towards interest and payment made towards principal was done away with. It is clear that the legislature wanted to extend the benefit of extension period of limitation when payment is made by the debtor to a creditor irrespective of whether payment is made towards principal or payment is made towards interest. But only requirement is that the date on which the part payment is made, both principal and interest should be due. In my opinion, accepting the construction suggested by the Petitioner of the term \"debt\" found in Section 19 of the Limitation Act would nullify the purpose for which the legislature effected the amendment in the provisions of sub-section 1 of Section 20 which is the provision identical to the provisions of Section 19 of the Limitation Act. In any case, in my opinion, the construction placed by the learned arbitrator on the provisions of Section 19 cannot be said to lead to injustice, on the contrary it leads to justice and convenience, and therefore, in my opinion, so far as the award made by the learned arbitrator in this regard is concerned, it cannot be disturbed.\t\t\t\t  [Para 17]"

Sub-section (2), employing non-obstante clause, says that notwithstanding any term in an arbitration agreement to the effect that no cause of action shall accrue in respect of any matter required by the agreement to be referred until an award is made under the agreement, a cause of action shall, for the purpose of limitation, be deemed to have accrued in respect of any such matter at the time when it would have accrued but for that term in the agreement. Sub-section (3) thereof states that for the purposes of this section and of the Indian Limitation Act, 1908 an arbitration shall be deemed to be commenced when one party to the arbitration agreement serves on the other party thereto a notice requiring the appointment of an arbitrator, or where the arbitration agreement provides that the reference shall be to a person named or designated in the agreement, requiring that the difference be submitted to the person so named or designated. Sub-sections (4) and (5) are omitted as being not material. It would, therefore, be clear that the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply to arbitrations and notwithstanding any term in the contract to the contrary, cause of arbitration for the purpose of limitation shall be deemed to have accrued to the party in respect of any such matter at the time when it should have accrued but for the contract. Cause of arbitration shall be deemed to have commenced when one party serves the notice on the other party requiring the appointment of an arbitrator. The question is when the cause of arbitration arises in the absence of issuance of a notice or omits to issue for long time or contract to the contrary? The period of limitation for the commencement of an arbitration runs from the date on which, had there been no arbitration clause, the cause of action would have accrued. Just as in the case of civil actions the claim is not to be brought after the expiration of a specified number of years from the date on which the cause of action accrued, so in the case of arbitrations, the claim is not to be put forward after the expiration of the specified number of years from the date when the claim accrued.

As Limitation Act, 1963 is made applicable to arbitrations, in the case of a counter claim by a respondent in an arbitral proceedings, the date on which the counter claim is made before the arbitrator will be the date of \"institution\" in so far as counter claim is concerned. There is, therefore, no need to provide a date of 'commencement' as in the case of claims of a claimant. Section 21 of the Act is therefore not relevant for counter claims. There is however one exception. Where the respondent against whom a claim is made, had also made a claim against the claimant and sought arbitration by serving a notice to the claimant but subsequently raises that claim as a counter claim in the arbitration proceedings initiated by the claimant, instead of filing a separate application under section 11 of the Act, the limitation for such counter claim should be computed, as on the date of service of notice of such claim on the claimant and not on the date of filing of the counter claim.

Respondents 2 to 5 executed a continuing deed of guarantee assuring due payment of all advances, liabilities and bills discounted before or after the date of the deed of guarantee. They also executed a continuing security letter. The Respondent no.2 as managing director of Respondent 1 acknowledged amount due from time to time, the last acknowledgement being dated 10-7-1981. Ultimately, after notices, the appellant Bank filed suit for Rs. 10.06,683.69 with interest at 18% . The trial court decreed the suit against Respondent No.1 but dismissed it against Respondents 2 to 5, the guarantors holding that in view of S.20(2) of the Limitation Act, the acknowledgements did not extend the Limitation as against the guarantors. It was held that guarantors were joint contractors and therefore S.20(2) of limitation Act applied. In appeal.\n\nHeld, the conclusion recorded by the trial court is entirely faulty and cannot be sustained. It is incorrect to suggest that the guarantors are joint contractors. The guarantors have not entered into contract for securing loan or debt from the bank but contract of guarantee merely ensures that the principal debtor will make payment and the guarantors would also be liable. The liability of the guarantors is co-extensive with the principal debtor but that does not make them joint contractors. In this case, there is a specific contract between the guarantors and the appellant Bank that the liability of the guarantors will continue till the liability of the principal debtor is not settled and there is no refusal on the part of the principal debtor to make payment. It is therefore not correct to say that the suit is barred by limitation against defendants Nos 2 to 5 the guarantors.\n\nA.I.R. 1979 S.C. 102 relied on.  [Para 4]"

The same was rejected.  Her cause of action was different and distinct from that of her brother.  One lis was in relation to the declaration of title as also possession, another one was in respect of damages for wrongful detention of specific movable properties.  Only because in another legal proceedings by and between the appellant and Respondent No.2, Commissioner was appointed and inventory of the goods of the said room was prepared, the same would not give rise to a fresh cause of action for laying a claim for damages.  The matter might have been different if a suit for possession of the goods had been filed.  [Para 9,10]"

Limitation Act (1963), Art.148.\n\nAccording to the old Limitation Act i.e. Limitation Act of 1908 as per Article 148, the limitation period was of 60 years to redeem  the mortgage. The said period of limitation started from the date on which the right to redemption accrues to the mortgagor. The said period of 60 years expires in the year 1987. However, the new Limitation Act came into force in the year 1963. According to the new Limitation Act, Article 61 is applicable which lays down the period of limitation for the redemption of mortgage which is 30 years from the date on which the right to redemption accrues. It was submitted that by virtue of Section 30 of the Limitation Act if the limitation period as per the new Act is shorter than that of the old one, the suit for redemption will be filed within a period of seven years from the date on which the new Limitation Act came into force. The said Limitation Act of 1963 came into force on and from 1st January, 1964 and therefore, the suit for redemption should have been filed on or about 1st January, 1971. The present suit was filed in January, 1981 therefore, it is barred by limitation. However, in this respect it must be noted, the nature of the present mortgage is a composite mortgage because there is also a personal covenant to pay mortgage money and mortgagor has a right to recover the mortgage money by putting the property to sell. It is to be noted that limitation has to be computed from 27.8.1927 as the repayment was to be made within 10 years and limitation cannot be computed from the death of Laxmibai. P.W.1 Krishna has deposed that he had approached appellants about seven years prior to the filing of the suit and had offered to pay the amount, however, the said offer was not accepted. Then the testimony of P.W.1 Krishna was further corroborated by P.W.2 Sharanappa Patil. He has also deposed that he was with P.W.1 Krishna and others when the offer was made for redemption. It is to be noted that this aspect of testimony is not challenged on the point of offer of redemption. Therefore, time will begin from this date. Article 61 provides limitation of 30 years  for a redemption suit, and therefore, suit filed in the year 1981 would be within limitation and provision of Section 30 of the Limitation Act cannot be invoked in the present set of circumstances.

Adverse possession, as its words imply, must be actual possession of another's land with intention to hold it and claim it as of his own to the exclusion of the rightful owner.

The factum of possession in the instant case only goes on to objectively indicate intention to possess the land. The present case is one of the few ones where even an unusually long undisturbed possession does not go on to prove the intention of the adverse possessor. This is a rare circumstance. There must be intention to dispossess. And it needs to be open and hostile enough to bring the same to the knowledge and plaintiff has an opportunity to object. After all adverse possession right is not a substantive right but a result of the waiving (willful) or omission (negligent or otherwise) of right to defend or care for the integrity of property on the part of the paper owner of the land. Adverse possession statutes, like other statutes of limitation, rest on a public policy that do not promote litigation and aims at the repose of conditions that the parties have suffered to remain unquestioned long enough to indicate their acquiescence. It is important to appreciate the question of intention as it would have appeared to the paper-owner. The issue is that intention of the adverse user gets communicated to the paper owner of the property. This is where the law gives importance to hostility and openness as pertinent qualities of manner of possession. It follows that the possession of the adverse possessor must be hostile enough to give rise to a reasonable notice and opportunity to the paper owner.   [Para 12]\n\nAdverse possession is a right which comes into play not just because someone loses his right to reclaim the property out of continuous and willful neglect but also on account of possessor's positive intent to dispossess. Therefore it is important to take into account before stripping somebody of his lawful title, whether there is an adverse possessor worthy and exhibiting more urgent and genuine desire to dispossess and step into the shoes of the paper-owner of the property. This test forms the basis of decision in the instant case.  \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 32]\n\nLimitation statutes as statutes of repose have utility and convenience as their purpose. Nevertheless, there has been change on this front as well. Human rights have been historically considered in the realm of individual rights such as, right to health, right to livelihood, right to shelter and employment etc. but now human rights are gaining a multifaceted dimension. Right to property is also considered very much a part of the new dimension. Therefore, even claim of adverse possession has to be read in that context.   [Para 33,18]"

Similarly, a mistake of law committed by the advocate for the party stands on the same footing as mistake by the party himself. Being so, a party acting in good faith as per the advice of his lawyer which has been given with due care and attention by the lawyer can certainly request for indulgence of the Court under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963. This does not mean that every wrong advice given by a lawyer will entitle a party to claim such indulgence from the Court. When there is neither misconduct nor negligence nor want of reasonable skill but there is bonafide mistake which any skilled person may make in normal course would be sufficient to ensure indulgence of the court to a party who has been victim of such mistake of his lawyer.

It is to be borne in mind the maxim \"Summum Jus, Summa Injuria\". Extreme law is extreme injury. The learned Additional District Judge has been impressed much on account of duration of delay. In the matter of condonation of delay, the duration of delay is insignificant. The Court has to take into account whether there is acceptable explanation or pardonable explanation.

Thus the period of three years prescribed in the Limitation Act could have started only from the date such extension was to expire.  The trial court decided to adjudicate the issue of limitation without considering any evidence which the purchasers might be willing to lead in support of their case for extension of time in terms of the agreement.  The trial court was also not justified in observing that the granting of the extension would amount to defeat the statutory provision of the Act inasmuch as it would be intended to enlarge the period of limitation stipulated in Article 54.  Question of limitation would arise only in case the purchasers were not able to succeed in their attempt to show that the period of performance was validly extended by them in favour of the vendors.  For that purpose the purchasers were expected to lead evidence to substantiate their case.  By denying to them an opportunity to adduce such evidence obviously serious prejudice was caused to them thus leading to miscarriage of justice.  The trial court also decided the issue of limitation by looking into some aspects which were not argued by the parties across the bar and without affording to them an opportunity to address the court in this regard.  The stand taken by the trial court had clearly violated the principles of natural justice.  [Para 8,9]"

Therefore, when the Legislator has given more beneficial treatment to the minors by providing Art.60 it would be inappropriate to apply Article 65 wherein claim is to be based on title.

Generally a decree or order becomes enforceable from its date, but in appropriate cases the Court passing the decree may prescribe time wherefrom the decree becomes enforceable on a future date. It must, however, be remembered that the purposes of execution proceeding is to enable the decree-holder to obtain the fruits of his decree. In case where the language of the decree is capable of two interpretations, one of which assists the decree-holder to obtain the fruits of the decree and the other preventing him from taking the benefits of the decree, the interpretation which assists the decree-holder should be accepted. The execution of the decree should not be made futile on mere technicalities which does not, however, mean that where a decree is incapable of being executed under any provision of law it should, in all cases, be executed notwithstanding such bar or prohibition. A rational approach is necessitated keeping in view the prolonged factum of litigation resulting in the passing of a decree in favour of a litigant.

The language of Article 136 cannot be strained in favour of the judgment-debtors who have been found to have not availed of the benefits of decree conferred upon them as they are proved to have failed to pay the amount even in instalments. The decree in the instant case is not capable of any other interpretation. As a general rule the executing Court should not find ways to dismiss the execution application as barred by time unless it is established, beyond doubt, that such an application was beyond limitation. The execution application seeking possession of the land, the subject-matter of the decree, was filed in April, 1994, admittedly, within a period of twelve years as prescribed under Article 136 of the Limitation Act and as such it was not liable to be dismissed.

What colour the expression 'sufficient cause' would get in the factual matrix of a given case would largely depend on bona fide nature of the explanation. If the Court finds that there has been no negligence on the part of the applicant and the cause shown for the delay does not lack bona fides, then it may condone the delay. If, on the other hand, the explanation given by the applicant is found to be concocted or he is thoroughly negligent in prosecuting his cause, then it would be a legitimate exercise of discretion not to condone the delay. In cases involving the State and its agencies/instrumentalities, the Court can take note of the fact that sufficient time is taken in the decision making process but no premium can be given for total lethargy or utter negligence on the part of the officers of the State and / or its agencies / instrumentalities and the applications filed by them for condonation of delay cannot be allowed as a matter of course by accepting the plea that dismissal of the matter on the ground of bar of limitation will cause injury to the public interest.   [Para 18]\n\nIn this case, unfortunately the learned Single Judge of the High Court altogether ignored the gapping holes in the story concocted by the Corporation about misplacement of the papers and total absence of any explanation as to why nobody even bothered to file applications for issue of certified copies of judgment for more than 7 years. The cause shown by the Corporation for delayed filing of the appeals was, to say the least, wholly unsatisfactory and the reasons assigned by the learned Single Judge for condoning more than 7 years delay cannot but be treated as poor apology for the exercise of discretion by the Court under Section 5 of the Limitation Act.

Adverse possession, as its words imply, must be actual possession of another's land with intention to hold it and claim it as of his own, to the exclusion of the rightful owner.  It must commence with the wrongful possession of the rightful owner at some particular time and must commence, in wrong against right.  It must be actual, open notorious and hostile under claim of right, continuous and exclusive and maintained for the statutory period.  Possession and adverse possession do not mean the same thing.  Mere user of the property cannot be taken as a definite assertion of the proprietary rights, there must be definite quality in the possession before it can be called adverse and some act of unequivocal character to put the owner on guard.  There cannot be adverse possession if the claimant himself does not know that he was occupying somebody's land. However, cannot be converted into adverse possession unless it is proved that the person in possession asserted as adverse title to the property, to the knowledge of the true owners for a period of 12 years or more.\t  [Para 14]\n\nIn instant case the possession of the defendants was permissive. Their plea reveals that they did not claim that they have perfected their title to the suit house by virtue of adverse possession and what has been pleaded is that defendant No.1 acquired and completed his right of management over the property in the suit house which is private trust property by open, peaceful possession thereof for the last more than 30 years. In the circumstances it could not be said that the defendants became owner of the suit house by adverse possession.\t [Para 17]"

It is true that the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 intended to expedite the commercial issue expeditiously. It is also clear from the statement of objects and reasons that in order to recognize economic reforms the settlement of both of domestic & international commercial disputes should be disposed of quickly so that country's economic progress be expedited. The statement of objects and reasons also nowhere indicate that Section 14 of the Limitation Act shall be excluded. But on the contrary intendment of legislature is apparent in the present case as Section 43 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 applies the Limitation Act, 1963 as a whole. It is only by virtue of sub-section (2) of section 29 of the Limitation Act, its operation is excluded to that extent of the area which is covered under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. By virtue of sub-section (2) of section 29 of the Limitation Act that the provisions of Limitation Act shall stand excluded in Act of 1996 to the extent area which is covered by the Act of 1996. In the present case under section 34 by virtue of sub-section 3 only the application for filing and setting aside the award a period has been prescribed as 3 months and delay can be condoned to the extent of 30 days. To this extent the applicability of section 5 of Limitation will stand excluded but there is no provision in the Act of 1996 which excludes operation of section 14 of the Limitation Act. If two Acts can be read harmoniously without doing violation to the words used therein, then there is no prohibition in doing so. The view taken by the court below excluding the applicability of Section 14 in this proceeding is not correct. \t\t [Para 27]"

Adverse possession really means the hostile possession which is expressly or impliedly in denial of title of the true owner and in order to constitute adverse possession the possession proved must be adequate in continuity, in publicity and in extent so as to show that it is adverse to the true owner. The classical requirements of acquisition of title by adverse possession are that such possession in denial of the true owner's title must be peaceful, open and continuous. The possession must be open and hostile enough to be capable of being known by the parties interested in the property, though it is not necessary that there should be evidence of the adverse possessor actually informing the real owner of the former's hostile action.   [Para 22]\n\nIn this case the High Court has erred in holding that even if the defendants claim adverse possession, they do not have to prove who is the true owner and even if they had believed that the Government was the owner and not the plaintiffs, the same was inconsequential. Obviously, the requirements of proving adverse possession have not been established. If the defendants are not sure who is the true owner the question of their being in hostile possession and the question of denying title of the true owner do not arise. Above being the position the High Court's judgment was clearly unsustainable.   [Para 23]"

Considerable delay of procedural red-tape in the process of their making decision is a common feature. Therefore, certain amount of latitude is not impermissible. If the appeals brought by the State are lost for such default no person is individually affected but what in the ultimate analysis suffers, is public interest. The expression \"sufficient cause\" should, therefore, be considered with pragmatism in justice-oriented approach rather than the technical detection of sufficient cause for explaining every day's delay. The factors which are peculiar to and characteristic of the functioning of the governmental conditions would be cognizant to and requires adoption of pragmatic approach in justice-oriented process. The court should decide the matters on merits unless the case is hopelessly without merit. No separate standards to determine the cause laid by the State vis-a-vis private litigant could be laid to prove strict standards of sufficient cause. The Government at appropriate level should constitute legal cells to examine the cases whether any legal principles are involved for decision by the courts or whether cases require adjustment and should authorise the officers to take a decision or give appropriate permission for settlement. In the event of decision to file appeal needed prompt action should be pursued by the officer responsible to file the appeal and he should be made personally responsible for lapses, if any. Equally, the State cannot be put on the same footing as an individual. The individual would always be quick in taking the decision whether he would pursue the remedy by way of an appeal or application since he is a person legally injured while State is an impersonal machinery working through its officers or servants. When the factual background is considered in the light of legal principles as noted above the inevitable conclusion is that the delay of 57 days deserved condonation. Therefore, the order of the High Court refusing to condone the delay is set aside. 1996(3) SCC 132 and 1996(10) SCC 634 Ref.\t [Para 17,19]"

Admittedly, the plaintiff respondent had remained in possession for a long time i.e. since 1953.  It may be true that in his plaint, plaintiff did not specifically plead ouster but moffusil pleadings, as is well known, must be construed liberally.  Pleadings must be construed as a whole. Only because the parties did not use the terminology which they should have, ipso facto, would not mean that the ingredients for satisfying the requirements of statute are absent.  There cannot be any doubt whatsoever that having regard to the changes brought about by Articles 64 and 65 of the Limitation Act, 1963 vis-a-vis Articles 142 and 144 of the Limitation Act, 1908, the onus to prove adverse possession would be on the person who raises such a plea. It is also furthermore not in dispute that the possession of a co-sharer is presumed to be possession of the other co-sharers unless contrary is proved. A plea of adverse possession or a plea of ouster would indisputably be governed by Articles 64 and 65 of the Limitation Act.  Mere assertion of title by itself may not be sufficient unless plaintiff proves animus possidendi.  The plaintiff's intention to possess properties in suit exclusively and not for and on behalf of other co-owners is evident from the fact that defendants appellants themselves had earlier filed two suits. Such suits were filed for partition.  In those suits defendants-appellants claimed themselves to be co-owners of the plaintiff.  A bare perusal of judgments of the courts below clearly demonstrates that plaintiff had even therein asserted hostile title claiming ownership in himself.  The claim of hostile title by plaintiff over suit land, therefore, was, thus, known to appellants.  Express denial of title was made by plaintiff-respondent in the said suit in his written statements. The plaintiff made his hostile declaration claiming title for property at least in his written statement in the suit filed in 1968.  Thus, at least from 1968 onwards, plaintiff continued to exclusively possess suit land with knowledge of defendants-appellants. The parties went to trial fully knowing their respective cases, fact that they had been co-owners was not an issue.  The parties proceeded to adduce evidences in support of their respective cases. Article 65 of Limitation Act, 1963, therefore, would in a case of this nature have its role to play, if not from 1953, but at least from 1968.  If that be so, finding of High Court that respondent perfected his title by adverse possession and ouster cannot be said to be vitiated in law. In this case, however, a finding of fact has been arrived at by all the three courts. They have analysed the evidences on record.  They have taken into consideration the correct legal position operating in the field as also conduct of the parties.  They applied correct principles of law as regards 'burden of proof'.  There is no infirmity in the impugned judgment.\t [Para 18,19,21,22,23,24,25,26,27,28,32,33,34]"

The provisions of section 35 provides that any person being aggrieved by any decision or order passed by the Central Excise Officer may within three months from the date of such decision may appeal to the appellate authority.\n\nThe Commissioner of Central Excise (Appeals) empowered to hear appeals under section 35 of the Central Excise and Salt Act, cannot be treated as forum functioning as a Court nor the said authority can be said to have trappings of the Court.  Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act is not attracted to the appeals preferred under section 35 of the Act and, consequently, section 5 of the Limitation Act would not be applicable to such appeals.  2005(1) Bom.C.R. 58 - Rel. on.

The right extinguished is the right which the lawful owner has and against whom a claim for adverse possession is made, therefore, the plaintiff who makes a claim for adverse possession has to plead and prove the date on and from which he claims to be in exclusive, continuous and undisturbed possession. The question whether possession is adverse or not is often one of simple fact but it may also be a conclusion of law or a mixed question of law and fact. The facts found must be accepted, but the conclusion drawn from them, namely, ouster or adverse possession is a question of law and has to be considered by the Court.   [Para 12]\n\nIn the matter of adverse possession, the Court have to find out the plea taken by the plaintiff in the plaint. In the plaint, the plaintiff who claims to be owner by adverse possession has to plead actual possession. He has to plead the period and the date from which he claims to be in possession. The plaintiff has to plead and prove that his possession was continuous, exclusive and undisturbed to the knowledge of the real owner of the land. He has to show a hostile title. He has to communicate his hostility to the real owner. None or these aspects have been considered by the High Court in its impugned judgments stated above, the impugned judgment is under section 96, Civil Procedure Code, it is not a judgment under section 100, Civil Procedure Code. As stated above, adverse possession or ouster is an inference to be drawn from the facts proved  (and) that work is of the first Appellate Court.\t\t   [Para 13]"

Since a decree in a suit for partition creates rights and liabilities of the  parties with respect to the immovable properties, it is considered as an instrument liable for the payment of stamp duty under the Indian Stamp Act. The object of the Stamp Act being securing the revenue for the State, the scheme of the Stamp Act provides that a decree of partition not duly stamped can be impounded and once the requisite stamp duty along with penalty, if any, is paid the decree can be acted upon. The engrossment of the final decree in a suit for partition would relate back to the date of the decree. The beginning of the period of limitation for executing such a decree cannot be made to depend upon date of the engrossment of such a decree on the stamp paper. The date of furnishing of stamp paper is an uncertain act, within the domain purview and control of a party. No date or period is fixed for furnishing stamp papers. No rule has been shown to us requiring the Court to call upon or give any time for furnishing of stamp paper. A party by his own act of not furnishing stamp paper cannot stop the running of period of limitation. None can take advantage of his own wrong. The proposition that period of limitation would remain suspended till stamp paper is furnished and decree engrossed thereupon and only thereafter the period of twelve years will begin to run would lead to absurdity.   [Para 25,26]\n\nIn the present case the Court has not passed an order directing the parties to furnish the stamp papers for the purpose of engrossing the decree.  Merely because there is no direction by the Court to furnish the stamp papers for engrossing of the decree or there is no time limit fixed by law, does not mean that the party can furnish stamp papers at its sweet will and claim that the period of limitation provided under Article 136 of the Act would start only thereafter as and when the decree is engrossed thereupon. The starting of period of limitation for execution of a partition decree cannot be made contingent upon the engrossment of the decree on the stamp paper. The engrossment of the decree on stamp paper would relate back to the date of the decree, namely, 7th August, 1981, in the present case. In this view the execution application filed on 21st March, 1994 was time barred having been filed beyond the period of twelve years prescribed under Article 136 of the Act. The High Court committed illegality in coming to the conclusion that it was not barred by limitation.   [Para 27]"

It is manifest that though Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 envisages the explanation of delay to the satisfaction of the Court, and makes no distinction between the State and the citizen, nonetheless adoption of a strict standard of proof in case of the Government, which is dependant on the actions of its officials, who often do not have any personal interest in its transactions, may lead to grave miscarriage of justice and therefore, certain amount of latitude is permissible in such cases.

'Parde Ke Peechhe Kya Hai' in the issue of Hindi Newspaper dt.13.1.1994 he was defamed.  It was contended by defendant that present suit filed on 14.12.1995 beyond the period of one year was barred.  The plaintiff contended that time taken in prosecuting the complaint before the Press Council of India should be excluded.\n\nHeld under S.12 the date on which the present suit was filed has to be excluded but that does not help the plaintiff. Sub sections (2), (3) and (4) on its face have no application to the suits.  As regards Section 14 of the Limitation Act, it may be observed that it provides exclusion of time taken in bonafide prosecuting proceedings in Court without jurisdiction.  The proceedings by way of complaint filed by the plaintiff before Press Council of India under the Press Council Act is a proceeding of entirely different nature having no semblance of 'civil proceeding' as contemplated under Section 14.  The damages sought by the plaintiff in the suit could not have been claimed in the complaint filed by him before Press Council of India nor was complaint filed for the said purpose.  The complaint filed by the plaintiff was not 'another civil proceeding' prosecuted by the plaintiff, even if be assumed with due diligence and in good faith, relating to the same matter in issue before the Court.  The Press Council of India is neither court nor the complaint is a civil proceeding as contemplated under Section 14 of the Limitation Act and, therefore, the plaintiff cannot derive any advantage of the time consumed in prosecuting complaint before the Press Council of India.  In other words, the plaintiff is not entitled to the time from 24.1.1994 to 4.8.1995 during which the complaint remained pending before Press Council of India.\t  [Para 8]"

It has come in the evidence that when the appellant started construction in the plaint schedule land, on the strength of the permission obtained under Ex.A-9, DWs.1 and 2 and others, on behalf of D-1, had obstructed; and in fact, cut away the steel rods, used for raising pillars.  The fact that, for the past more than a decade, the same condition subsists on the ground, discloses that the appellant did not exercise rights of possession over it.  The pahanies are hardly of any use to it.

The accident in question having occurred on 9.6.1990,the suit was liable to be filed within a period of one year from said date. It is however not in dispute that four of the plaintiffs were minors when the suit was filed on 27.10.1994.Under S. 6 (1) of the said Act, if a plaintiff is a minor at the time when the suit is sought to be instituted, he is permitted to institute such suit within the same period as prescribed after the disability as regards minority has ceased. Under S. 7 of the said Act where several persons are jointly entitled to institute a suitand one of them is under disability due to which the suit cannot be instituted, unless a discharge can be given without the concurrence of such person, time would not run against all the said persons.From the aforesaid provisions, it is clear that firstly if a plaintiff is a minor he is entitled to the benefit of the period till he attains the majority. Similarly, where a proceeding can be jointly instituted, even if one of the plaintiffs is a minor and discharge cannot be given by the other plaintiffs the time would not run against all of them. In present case as the plaintiff nos.1 and 2 were under a legal disability as they were minors when the period of limitation of one year after the incident in question expired, they were entitled to file the suit within a period of one year after attaining the age of majority. The suit thus having been filed by their mother who could not givethem valid discharge as contemplated by S. 7 of the said Act was within limitation.The plaintiffs are entitled for the benefit of provisions of Ss. 6 and 7 of the said Act for extending the period of limitation.

Limitation Act does not prescribe any specific Article for determining period of limitation in such suit. An administration suit could be by creditor for recovery of his debt or legal heirs. Therefore, period of limitation applicable to such suit would depend on who plaintiff is and what his specific cause of action is. It is for that reason that Limitation Act has not explicitly provided period of limitation for such suit. If suit is by creditor, cause of action is to recover debt, appropriate Article residuary Art.113 will be applicable and period of limitation would be three years. Whereas suit is by legal heir for legacy or for share of residue bequeathed by testator or for distributive share of property of an intestate, Article 106 will be applicable. Thus, pleadings and prayers of suit for administration would have to be analysed and thereafter, relevant Article is to be made applicable. Onus will be on party claiming benefit of shorter period of limitation to establish that case fell within special rule limiting period of shorter time. If in situation two articles of law may be wide enough to cover given right of suit and Court is unable to come to a conclusion that one applies more specifically than other, then it should lean in favour of application which would keep the right of suit alive in preference to that which would destroy it.

Therefore, the suit should have been filed on or before 22-5-1993 and even if the plaintiff was entitled to one month period for the notice under Section 304, one month's period expires on 8-5-1993 because the plaintiff had given notice under Section 304 on 8-4-1993.

The word 'enforceable' should be read in its literal sense. In the contextual facts, the final decree upon acceptance of the report of the Commissioner was passed on 20-11-1970, while it is true that notice to furnish stamp paper was issued on 28-2-1972 and the time granted was up to 17-3-1972 but that by itself will not take it out of the purview of Article 136 as regards the enforceability of the decree. Furnishing of stamped paper was an act entirely within the domain and control of the appellant and any delay in the matter of furnishing of the same cannot possibly be said to be putting a stop to the period of limitation being run - no one can take advantage of his own wrong : As a matter of fact, in the contextual facts no stamp paper was filed until 26-3-1984 - Does that mean and imply that the period of limitation as prescribed under Article 136 stands extended for a period of twelve years from 26th March, 1984? The answer if it be stated to be in the affirmative, would lead to an utter absurdity and a mockery of the provisions of the statute. Suspension of the period of limitation by reason of one's own failure cannot but be said to be a fallacious argument: though however suspension can be had when the decree is a conditional one in the sense that some extraneous events have to happen on the fulfilment of which alone it could be enforced - furnishing of stamped paper was entirely in the domain and power of the decree-holder and there was nothing to prevent him from acting in terms therewith and thus it cannot but be said that the decree was capable of being enforced on and from 20th November, 1970 and the twelve years period ought to be counted therefrom.

The expression 'date fixed for the performance' is a crystallized notion. This is clear from the fact that the second part \"time from which period begins to run\" refers to a case where no such date is fixed. To put it differently, when date is fixed it means that there is a definite date fixed for doing a particular act. Even in the second part the stress is on 'when the plaintiff has notice that performance is refused'. Here again, there is a definite point of time, when the plaintiff notices the refusal. In that sense both the parts refer to definite dates. So, there is no question of finding out an intention from other circumstances. Whether the date was fixed or not the plaintiff had notice that performance is refused and the date thereof are to be established with reference to materials and evidence to be brought on record. The expression 'date' used in Article 54 of the Schedule to the Act definitely is suggestive of a specified date in the calendar.   [Para 6,7]"

The appellant all through out was aware of the mutation entry but the Appellant never took any steps to challenge the mutation entry, which, in fact, the Appellant ought to have done on or before 7th December, 1961.  Respondent had been holding the property in possession adverse to the interest of the Appellant openly and in a hostile manner and by getting the mutation entry changed as early as on 8th December, 1960 which was also never challenged.  Admittedly, the respondent has been claiming to be the owner ever since 8th December, 1960 to the knowledge of Appellant, whereas the suit was filed in the year 1975, which is clearly barred by the law of limitation.  The adoption has been acted upon for a long period cannot now be negatived. Both the lower Courts have erred in holding that the adoption was not proved. Long period of recognition as an adopted son raised a presumption in favour of valid adoption. (1870-72) 14 Moo Ind App67 (PC) Foll.\t\t [Para 27,28,31,32]"

If court is satisfied that defendant has adopted dilatory tactics or where there is lack of bona fide, court may decline to condone delay in filing appeal u/S.96(2). Whether the defendant has adopted dilatory tactics or where there is lack of bona fide in pursuing the remedy of appeal under S. 96(2) of the code after the dismissal of the application under O. 9, R. 13 CPC, is a question of fact and the same has to be considered depending upon the facts and circumstances of each case. \n\n\tIn the present case, the respondent-plaintiff has filed the Money Suit being for recovery of Rs.46,98,500/- together with interest and the said suit was decreed ex-parte. Appellant-defendant has filed application to condone the delay of 276 days in filing the application to set aside the ex-parte decree. In the said application, the appellant has stated that he has been residing at Chennai; whereas the notice was served at Trichy and therefore, he did not have knowledge about the filing of the said suit and the ex-parte decree was passed. The said application u/O.9, R. 13 was dismissed. Thereafter, the appellant has preferred the first appeal with the application to condone the delay of 546 days in filing the first appeal. There was already delay of 276 days in filing the application to set aside the ex-parte decree. Pursuing the proceedings in the application filed under O. 9, R. 13 CPC has caused further delay of 270 days. Thus, there has been a total delay of about 546 days in filing the first appeal. The appellant has shown his bona fide by depositing Rs.25,00,000/- in compliance with the orders of this Court. The said amount of Rs.25,00,000/- was permitted to be withdrawn by the respondent-plaintiff. Considering the facts and circumstances of the case and in the interest of justice, the appellant deserves an opportunity to put forth his defence in the suit for recovery of money. But to avail this opportunity, he must deposit the balance amount of Rs.20,00,000/- as a condition precedent for condonation of delay. Delay condoned on condition that appellant deposit Rs.20,00,000/-.\t [Para 15,17,18,19,20]"

Thus, these provisions apply only against a person on whom the property has become vested for any specific purpose.

This fact is further clear from the prayer clauses (a) to (c) of the plaint. The relief claimed by the appellants is for the declaration of assertion of their vested rights and for consequential reliefs of injunction and not for the possession.

                "description": "Applicability - Conditions to be satisfied before section can be pressed into service - Due diligence and good faith - Meaning of.\n\nSection 14 of the Limitation Act deals with exclusion of time of proceeding bona fide in a court without jurisdiction. On analysis of the said Section, it becomes evident that the following conditions must be satisfied before Section 14 can be pressed into service :\n\n(1)\tBoth the prior and subsequent proceedings are civil proceedings prosecuted by the same party;\n\n(2)\tThe prior proceeding had been prosecuted with due diligence and in good faith;\n\n(3)\tThe failure of the prior proceeding was due to defect of jurisdiction or other cause of like nature;\n\n(4)\tThe earlier proceeding and the latter proceeding must relate to the same matter in issue and;\n\n(5)\tBoth the proceedings are in a court.\n\nThe policy of the Section is to afford protection to a litigant against the bar of limitation when he institutes a proceeding which by reason of some technical defect cannot be decided on merits and is dismissed.  While considering the provisions of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, proper approach will have to be adopted and the provisions will have to be interpreted so as to advance the cause of justice rather than abort the proceedings.  It will be well to bear in mind that an element of mistake is inherent in the invocation of Section 14.  In fact, the section is intended to provide relief against the bar of limitation in cases of mistaken remedy or selection of a wrong forum.  On reading Section 14 of the Act it becomes clear that the legislature has enacted the said section to exempt a certain period covered by a bona fide litigious activity.  \t\t [Para 28]\n\nTo attract the provisions of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, five conditions enumerated in the earlier part of this Judgment have to co-exist.  There is no manner of doubt that the section deserves to be construed liberally.  Due diligence and caution are essentially pre-requisites for attracting Section 14.  Due diligence cannot be measured by any absolute standards.  Due diligence is a measure of prudence or activity expected from and ordinarily exercised by a reasonable and prudent person under the particular circumstances.  The time during which a court holds up a case while it is discovering that it ought to have been presented in another court, must be excluded, as the delay of the court cannot affect the due diligence of the party.  Section 14 requires that the prior proceeding should have been prosecuted in good faith and with due diligence.  The definition of good faith as found in Section 2(h) of the Limitation Act would indicate that nothing shall be deemed to be in good faith which is not done with due care and attention.  It is true that Section 14 will not help a party who is guilty of negligence, lapse or inaction.   However, there can be no hard and fast rule as to what amounts to good faith.  It is a matter to be decided on the facts of each case.  It will, in almost every case be more or less a question of degree.  The mere filing of an application in wrong court would not prima facie show want of good faith.  There must be no pretended mistake intentionally made with a view to delaying the proceedings or harassing the opposite party.   [Para 35]"

The power to excuse delay and grant an extension of time under Section 5 is discretionary whereas under Section 14, exclusion of time is mandatory, if the requisite conditions are satisfied.  Section 5 is broader in its sweep, than Section 14 in the sense that a number of widely different reasons can be advanced and established to show that there was sufficient cause in not filing the appeal or the application within time.  The ingredients in respect of Section 5 and 14 are different.  The effect of Section 14 is that in order to ascertain what is the date of expiration of the \"prescribed period\", the days excluded from operating by way of limitation, have to be added to what is primarily the period of limitation prescribed.

However, alternative pleas may not be mutually destructive. In the present case, the appellant's father (original plaintiff) had raised two mutually destructive pleas. In the first place, he raised a plea that he was inducted as a tenant by Wadiwala and continued to be in possession of the suit property as a tenant even after coming into force of the town planning scheme. Secondly, he claimed to be in adverse possession of the suit property. Plea of tenancy and plea of adverse possession cannot co-exist and they are mutually exclusive. The appellant's father not only claimed that his and Ramsurat's possession was permissive at the inception but also claimed that their possession was permissive (as a tenant) even after coming into force of the town planning scheme. Thus, the appellant claimed to be in permissive possession of the suit property even at the date of the suit. Permissive possession was claimed even against the respondent no.1, to whom the plot was allotted under the town planning scheme. He, therefore, could not claim adverse possession against the respondent no.1.  [Para 14,17]"

When the property is sought to be claimed by third party, ordinarily the third party would not have any right to that property. However, it is only on the ground that third party has set up a title to the knowledge of the true owner and continued in uninterrupted possession or in hostile possession of that property for over 12 years. Thus, law takes into account the fact that true owner has by virtue of his in-action, lack of action during the entire period of 12 years time, does nothing to reclaim the property and has allowed a right to accrue to the party in possession. These are factors usually that confer benefit of the right of adverse possession. This principle chiefly presupposes the fact that there is no other right available to the party claiming adverse possession. Thus, absence of no better rights in relation to such property in favour of the party, setting up a plea of adverse possession, is significant. Such plea of adverse possession has to be pleaded sufficiently and clearly by the party concerned. All facts need to be pleaded by the party concerned, if such party seeks benefit of doctrine of adverse possession and acquisition of title to such property, which undisputedly not owned by such party and to which no better right stands with party claiming benefit of such plea of adverse possession. The plea of adverse possession cannot be said to be a pure question of law. It can be said to be a mixed question of law and fact. A party setting up such plea must plead and establish that its possession was adequate in publicity, in continuity and for the statutory period of 12 years. It is sufficient that the possession to be overt and without any attempt at concealment so that a person against whom time is running ought if he exercises due vigilance to be aware of what is happening. Thus, there must be evidence of open assertion of hostile title occupied with exclusive possession and enjoyment to the knowledge of the other, i.e. true owner of the property. Such party, setting up plea of adverse possession must establish that it's possession was adverse to the knowledge of the real owner and denying the title of the real owner. Commencement of such adverse possession that is pointed out must be pleaded and proved for counting such statutory period of 12 years. It is thus clear that the person, who enters permissive possession, cannot plead acquisition of such title by principles of adverse possession. Facts may differ from case to case. 2007 ALL SCR 2209 - Ref. to.  [Para 8,9]"

What is the reasonable time is to be seen in Article 54 of the Limitation Act. For specific performance of contract three years time is prescribed under the said Article and, therefore, reasonable time means three years. Therefore, in the instant case, the sale deed should have been executed by the respondent/plaintiff within one month from the date of agreement of sale by obtaining permission from the authority. There was no such attempt to obtain permission. It is clear that from the date of agreement till enforcement of Maharashtra Act 41 of 1977, there was restriction on sale or transfer without prior permission of the Collector. After introduction of Section 31-AB by way of said Act of 41 of 1977, the said restriction was removed and, therefore, the sale deed should have been executed within one month. Even if the reasonable time is taken into consideration to execute the sale deed, from the date of introduction of Section 31-AB in the Maharashtra Act 41 of 1977, reasonable time of three years will expire in 1980. However, the suit is filed in 1981. Therefore, the trial Court was absolutely right in holding that the suit was time barred as the same was not filed within reasonable time.  Thus order of lower appellate Court holding suit was within limitation, liable to be set aside.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 25,26,27]"

The language of third column of Article 58 makes it clear that time runs from the date when right to sue first accrues.  [Para 54]\n\nThe suit land was purchased by defendant on request of plaintiff and from amount recovered from the plaintiff. Since the plaintiff was in military service the land was purchased in the name of defendant his uncle as Benami. His title was threatened by the behaviour of defendant and he filed suit for declaration of title within period of limitation after accrual of cause of action for first time. Consequently the suit was not barred.\t  [Para 56]\n\nEvery threat during the earlier period of plaintiff's right, however, ineffective and innocuous it was, could not be considered to be a clear and unequivocal threat so as to compell plaintiff to file suit till the year 1973. It was in the year 1973 defendant made an attempt to occupy the suit plot to establish his possession over it by erecting fencing around the suit plot. This attempt on the part of the defendant was thwarted by the interruption by the Watchman of plaintiff. It is also significant to note that defendant made this attempt very clandestinely in the sense knowing that plaintiff was away from the town. Then plaintiff realised that all silence till 1973 on the part of defendant was not innocuous and intention to infringe plaintiff's right over the suit plot was hidden or persisting in the mind of defendant. The attempt on the part of the defendant in the month of May 1973 was the outcome of that intention of the defendant to infringe plaintiff's right and title over the suit plot. In substance it was only in the year 1973 that plaintiff realised unequivocal interruption, infringement to the title over the suit property by the defendant and that is the time when the right to sue accrued and as such plaintiff filed in fact the suit in the year 1974. Therefore, the suit filed by the plaintiff was well within the limitation. The contention raised by learned counsel for appellant that suit is barred by limitation is absolutely incorrect. Therefore, the suit filed by plaintiff in 1974 was well within time.  [Para 56]"

Adverse possession, as its words imply, must be actual possession of another's land with intention to hold it and claim it as of his own, to the exclusion of the rightful owner.  It must commence with the wrongful possession of the rightful owner at some particular time and must commence, in wrong against right.  It must be actual, open, notorious and hostile under claim of right, continuous and exclusive and maintained for the statutory period.  Possession and adverse possession do not mean the same thing.  Mere user of the property cannot be taken as a definite assertion of the proprietory rights, there must be definite quality in the possession before it can be called adverse and some act of unequivocal character to put the owner on guard. There cannot be adverse possession if the claimant himself do not know that he was occupying somebody's land. However, permissive possession cannot be converted into adverse possession unless it is proved that the person in possession asserted an adverse title to the property, to the knowledge of the true owners for a period of 12 years or more.

So long as possession is that of a joint co-owner no question of any bar of limitation would arise during that period, and in the absence of ouster or exclusion the possession of one co-owner is not adverse to the other co-owner.  Whether ouster is proved depends upon the facts of each case.  The burden of proving ouster is on the person who claims to have ousted the others.  To establish ouster, it is necessary to prove the requisite animus, to prescribe title adversely to the other co-sharer.  There must be positive evidence of possession hostile to the other co-owners and this hostile animus must be brought to the knowledge of the co-owner against whom ouster is claimed.  Ouster is a positive matter; and the hostile animus necessary to constitute ouster must also be a positive matter.  It is a matter involving action, it cannot be mere inaction.  If the co-owner in possession did not give a share of the income to the co-owner out of possession merely because the latter did not ask for it, then such animus may be only a negative animus.  On the other hand, if the evidence shows that even if the co-owner out of possession demanded his share, the co-owner in possession would not have given him a share , then the animus is positive, in the sense that it is indicative of an animus to exclude.  For entertaining a hostile animus to ouster the real owner, the person in possession need not know who the real owner is, if he has the animus to hold the property as his against whole world including the real owner, whoever he be, known or unknown, the animus is sufficiently hostile to exclude the real owner also.\n\nThe test is whether the co-owner in possession has openly and unequivocally and to the knowledge of the other co-owners denied their title to the property.  A party who sets up a hostile title to the exclusion of co-heirs must be definite and unequivocal in his assertion.  When the assertions are in the nature of 'hide and seek', that is to say, mutually contradictory and merely intended for the purpose of taking a tractical advantage out of a litiguous situation, it cannot be considered as an assertion of hostile title adequate for the purpose of becoming the starting point in the acquisition of title by adverse possession.  In the present case, there is absolutely no evidence to prove the ouster and both the Courts below have committed an error of law in coming to the conclusion that the defendant has perfected his title by adverse possession resulting into miscarriage of justice. \t         [Para 21,22]"

An useful reference can be made to the scope of Indian Limitation Act.  This (Act) primarily applies to suits, appeals and applications and it has in term no application to the \"arbitration proceedings\" as it is not a suit. Section 3 of the Limitation Act provides that subject to the provisions contained in Sections 4 to 24 (inclusive) every suit instituted, appeal preferred, and applications made after the prescribed period shall be dismissed although the limitation has not been set up as defence.  The proceeding before the Arbitrator/s is not a suit, appeal or application and in terms of Section 3 can have no application thereto. To overcome this aspect, Section 43 is incorporated in the Act. Expiry of the period of limitation prescribed for a suit does not destroy the right : it only bars the remedy for enforcement of a right in a Court of law.  It cannot, therefore, be said that the provisions of the Limitation Act prevent an arbitrator/s or Arbitral Tribunal from adjudicating upon the claim which if brought before the Court of law may be barred by limitation, but it may proceed to consider at times even to entertain a claim which is barred by period of limitation.  Therefore, the arbitral proceedings are not suit and the arbitral Tribunal is not a Court.  By Section 43 of the Act, the provisions of Limitation Act are made applicable to the arbitrations. The proceedings before the Arbitrator and the proceedings before the Court u/s.34 cannot be equated and, therefore, Section 43 cannot be taken help of in construing Section 34 (3) of the Act.  [Para 20,21]\n\nThe provisions of Section 43 of the Act are only attracted to the proceedings before the arbitrators and the proceedings under section 34 of the Act are not the proceedings which are referred to under Section 43 of the Act. The Arbitrator before whom the proceedings were brought the claims which were barred by limitation have to be dismissed and for that purpose section 43 is to be construed and interpreted.  Therefore, the contention of Shri. Vayal that by virtue of Section 43 of the Act, the provisions of the Limitation Act are attracted in the application u/s.34, being without any substance, has to be rejected. [Para 22]"

The period of limitation for a suit on a dishonoured cheque ought to be traced from Art. 35 wherein limitation commences from the date of the cheque as distinct from Art. 40 where the commencement is from the date of dishonour. There appears to be an apparent distinction between Arts.35 and 40 though as per the definition of \u201cBill of Exchange\u201d in S. 2(c) of the Act, 1963 and definition of \u2018cheque\u2019 in S. 6 of the N.I.Act, either of the instruments embraces the other. The cheque by all means is an order issued by the drawer thereof directing his banker for payment of money to a specific or definite individual or entity. A cheque cannot be drawn on a person other than a Banker. This is what mainly distinguishes a cheque from a Bill of Exchange. A Bill of Exchange as defined by S. 5 of the N.I.Act is an instrument in writing containing an unconditional order, directing a certain person who may not be a Banker to make payment of certain sum of money to a certain person or bearer of the instrument.\n\tUnder the scheme of the N.I. Act, a Bill of Exchange is considered to be an instrument addressed to persons in general whereas a cheque could be drawn only on a specified banker. Unless this distinction maintained by the N.I.Act is perceived, suits embraced by Art. 40 are likely to be mistaken for those based on dishonoured cheques also. The expression \u201crefusal to accept\u201d in Art. 40 can naturally refer only to persons other than a bank since the act of refusing to accept a Bill of Exchange does not associate with a banker, though he may for various reasons refuse to honour a cheque. On the other hand, what we understand from the scheme of provisions in the N.I.Act is that the words \u2018refusal to accept\u2019 could fit in only with the context of Bills of Exchange refused to be honoured by the drawees. In view of this position, the appropriate provision that applies to a suit instituted on dishonour of cheques can legally be Art. 35 alone.\t\t\t\t(Paras 14, 15)"

                "description": "Adverse possession - Claim of - Government does not enjoy any immunity or privilege.\n\nThe law of adverse possession branches out of the law of limitation. Article 65 states that if the possession for immovable property or any interest therein based on title is of 12 years, then the possession of the defendant becomes adverse to the plaintiff. A title by adverse possession can be prescribed also against the Government, so the Government does not enjoy any immunity or privilege where the adverse possession is claimed. However, some concession of longer period of claiming adverse possession is given in favour of the Government under Article 112 of the Limitation Act where the period of limitation to run is for 30 years. In the corresponding Article 149 of the Limitation Act of 1908 (old), it is made clear that the Article applies also to Government like a private person. The concept of adverse possession is borrowed from British Law. The common law recognizes the theory earlier of \"nullum tempus occurrit regi\", which means, no time affects the Crown. The reason for this was that the State should not suffer for the negligence of its officers or for their fraudulent hand-in-glove transactions with the adverse party. However, common law fixed a period of 60 years limitation in respect of suits on behalf of or against the Crown and the same was adopted by the Indian Law under Article 149 (Old) and subsequently by way of amendment period is reduced from 60 to 30 years under Article 112 (new). However, the reason for giving a longer period to the Government when a party claims adverse possession is obvious; because the Government is not one person but is a body of persons taking decisions following procedural wrangles and moving like a python who is very slow in its action. \t\t\t [Para 14]"

It cannot be proved piecemeal. There must be proof as to the date, time and manner in which the possession became open and adverse and the owner is out of the possession. It is to be remembered that a person pleading adverse possession cannot claim equity in his favour since he is trying to defeat the rights of the true owner. The acquisition by adverse possession is an exception to law of acquisition of title through lawful means and therefore, it is to be pleaded with certainty and to be proved to the hilt. Thus, for the claim of adverse possession, a person should be in continuous, exclusive, open and peaceful possession for 12 years when he claims against the private parties and for 30 years, when he claims against the Government. \t [Para 14]"

It is a responsibility of the Court while accepting the document in the evidence, i.e., admitting the same in the evidence, to exhibit it so that the evidence is identified. Thus, the parties are aware that they must meet that evidence. This basic procedure of proving the documents thus ensures fair trial to the parties. No strict proof of the facts is required in civil trial. On the basis of preponderance of probabilities which are brought before the Court, the parties can prove their assertions. However, a party who asserts a case has to prove it. In a civil suit also, the initial burden is on the plaintiff and never on the defendants but onus shifts after plaintiff discharges his burden to prove his case and then the defendants' evidence can be looked into. \t [Para 27]"

Thereafter, the writ petition filed by the plaintiff was withdrawn by him on 27-11-1968.  Then the present suit for wrongful removal from service was filed by the plaintiff on 1-9-1969.\n\nHeld that the suit was barred by limitation .  The right of appeal did not involve the consequence that the order of removal could not be operative by its own force but would continue in abeyance until the decision of the appeal. With regard to S.14 of the Limitation Act,1963, it could not come to the reserve of the plaintiff.

Acceptance of explanation furnished should be the rule and refusal an exception more so when no negligence or inaction or want of bona fide can be imputed to the defaulting party. On the other hand, while considering the matter the Courts should not lose sight of the fact that by not taking steps within the time prescribed a valuable right has accrued to the other party which should not be lightly defeated by condoning delay In a routine like manner.

For applicability of the provision in sub-section (3) of S.14 certain conditions are to be satisfied. Before S.14 can be pressed into service, the conditions to be satisfied are : (1) Both the prior and subsequent proceedings are civil proceedings prosecuted by the same party; (2) the prior proceeding had been prosecuted with due diligence and good faith; (3) the failure of the prior proceeding was due to defect of jurisdiction or other cause of like nature; (4) the earlier proceeding and the later proceeding must relate to the same matter in issue, and (5) both the proceedings are in a Court.\n\nThe main factor which would influence the Court in extending the benefit of S.14 to a litigant is whether the prior proceeding had been prosecuted with due diligence and good faith. The party prosecuting the suit in good faith in the Court having no jurisdiction is entitled to exclusion of that period. The expression 'good faith' as used in S.14 means \"exercise of due care and attention.\" In the context of S.14 expression 'good faith' qualifies prosecuting the proceeding in the Court which ultimately is found to have no jurisdiction.

The third column in the article which indicates the time from which period begins to run, states that \"when the decree or order becomes enforceable..........\"  [Para 6]\n\nWhen is a decree becoming enforceable? Normally a decree or order becomes enforceable from its date. But cases are not unknown when the decree becomes enforceable on some future date or on the happening of certain specified events. The expression \"enforceable\" has been used to cover such decrees or orders also which become enforceable subsequently.  [Para 8]\n\nFiling of an appeal would not affect the enforceability of the decree, unless the appellate Court stays its operation. But if the appeal results in a decree that would supersede the decree passed by the lower Court and it is the appellate Court decree which becomes enforceable. When the appellate Order does not amount to a decree there would be no supersession and hence the lower Court decree continues to be enforceable.  [Para 9]\n\nHeld the decree became enforceable on 1-8-1973 when the Appellate Court passed the decree which superseded the decree of the trial Court. As no decree was passed by the High Court in the second appeal the decree of the first Appellate Court remained unaffected and the enforceability once commenced remained undisturbed for a period of 12 years therefrom. The execution process initiated by the appellant long after the expiry of 12 years from 1-8-1973 is thus irretrievably barred.   [Para 16]"

The evidence of a witness, an owner of adjoining land, revealed that the defendants were paying rent and land revenue to Jahagirdar. His evidence did not point out adverse interest and/or hostility on the part of the defendants to claim possession as owner. The plaintiffs became permanent tenant in the year 1945, it could not be said that the possession of the respondents was adverse to the plaintiffs from 1934. Further, it could not be said to be adverse to Jahagirdar when the evidence is to the effect that the rent and land revenue was being paid to Jahagirdar by the defendants. The witness, has expressed ignorance as to how defendant or his father had got the suit land. There is no pleading and evidence as to when the possession of the defendant became adverse to the plaintiffs. Not only that, but the fact of discontinuance or date of dispossession of the plaintiff is not accepted by the defendants. On the contrary, the defendants are coming with a came that they are continuously in possession of the property and, therefore, there is no dispossession or discontinuance of the defendants, possession. What is important to be taken into consideration while scrutinising the case of the tenants claiming adverse possession is that the said tenants/defendants are under obligation to point out as to at what point of time, they started claiming possession adverse to the knowledge of the true owner. Pleading and evidence in this respect is absent. Therefore, it could not be said that suit which has been filed by permanent tenant after coming into force of the Act of 1963 is not tenable in law in view of the provisions of Section 31 thereof.

The period of one year limitation now prescribed under Article 134 of the Limitation Act in substitution of a three year period prescribed under Article 180 of the Indian Limitation Act, 1908 is reflective of the legislative policy of finalizing proceedings in execution as quickly as possible by providing a quick forum to the auction purchaser to ask for the delivery of possession of the property purchased within that period from the date of the sale becoming absolute rather than from the date of issuance of the sale certificate.  On his failure to avail such a quick remedy the law relegates him to the remedy of a regular suit for possession based on title, subject again to limitation.\t [Para 14]"

The admission need not be in regard to any precise amount nor by expressed words.  If a defendant writes to the plaintiff requesting him to send his claim for verification and payment, it amounts to an acknowledgement.  But if the defendant merely says without admitting liability, it would like to examine the claim or the accounts, it may not amount to acknowledgement.  In other words, a writing, to be treated as an acknowledgement of liability should consciously admit his liability to pay or admit his intention to pay the debt.  What can be acknowledged is a present subsisting liability.  An acknowledgement made with reference to a liability, cannot extend limitation for a time barred liability or a claim that was not made at the time of acknowledgement or some other liability relating to other transactions.  Any admission of jural relationship in regard to the ascertained sum due or a pending claim, cannot be an acknowledgement for a new additional claim for damages.   [Para 15]"

Nothing prevents the court from modifying its earlier order for justifiable reason and when the party tries to obtain any relief without complying with the mandatory provision in relation to the procedure which is required to be followed, the courts are fully empowered to pass an appropriate order in exercise of inherent powers.  In the case in hand the order dated 12-12-2000 clearly discloses that appeal was required to be heard for admission after placing certified copy of the decree on record.  Being so, merely because the registry had placed the appeal for the purpose of final hearing that itself would not mean that judicial order passed by the court would stand nullified.  Mere listing of the case alongwith matters fixed for final hearing that itself would not decide the status of the case.  When the records apparently disclose that the matter is still required to be heard on admission, listing of such matters alongwith other final hearing and even taken up for the purpose of final hearing pursuant to listing of such matter on the board containing the matter for the final hearing that by itself would not disclose the stage at which the matter stands.  Being so, it cannot be said that the matter was admitted and could not have been disposed of without being heard finally.  That apart, considering that the appeal being continuation of the suit and bearing in mind provisions of Order 41 Rule 17 read with the provision of Section 151 and Order 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the default by a party would not restrict to non appearance of the party but would also include a default in carrying out any act necessary for the purpose of further progress of the proceedings in the appeal and failure on the part of the party to the appeal to perform such an act would, empower the court to dismiss the appeal for default.  Once the order dated 22-6-2001 clearly required the petitioners to explain the delay and to remove the objection and further being required to face the consequences of failure to explain the delay and to remove the office objection within the specified period and the petitioners having failed in that regard, nothing prevented the court from dismissing the appeal for default on 6-9-2001.  Mere absence of the word \"default\" in the order dated 6-9-2001 would not make any difference.\t [Para 24]"

However, at the same time, fallacy on the part of the appellants in the matter appeared to have been openly accepted by the appellants as is clear from the contents of paragraph-4 of this Civil Application. The question is could this reason be said to be sufficient for condoning the delay in filing the present appeal.  It is clear from the facts as narrated in the application that the appellants were not ignorant about the period of limitation.  It is further clear that the appellants atleast after filing the First Appeal in the High Court on 15-6-2002 were aware that the First Appeal was not maintainable as it was not the remedy open to challenge the order in the High Court but the remedy was to challenge the same before the High Court itself by filing Appeal from Order under Order 43 of the Civil Procedure Code.  However, lack of deligence on the part of the appellants in the matter till 31-1-2002, in the opinion of this court suggests a visible laxity on the part of the appellant institution and its attitude ranges from apathy to indifference disentitling itself to any leniency in the matter of condonation of delay. It is pertinent to note that the appellants before this Court cannot be said to be un-aware of the procedures and limitation in the legal proceedings.  The appellant no.1 is New India Assurance Company Ltd., and appellants nos.2 & 3 happened to be the officers high up in the echelon of the appellant no.1 company.  It is also clear that the institutions like the appellant company has its own legal cell having law officers and advisors in the legal matters.  It is definitely therefore, expected from such type of litigant to be more particular in respect of the legal matters of the company much less when the present type of disputes are there to be handled by the company. This court therefore, finds it difficult to give even slightest concession in the present matter wherein because of the impugned order certain advantages are definitely accrued to the respondent to which respondent is entitled to.  This Court therefore, finds it difficult to accept the reasons given in the application to be sufficient reasons or genuine or convincing reasons for condoning the delay which is also in-ordinate delay of 242 days.

But in construing such provisions equitable considerations are out of place, and the strict grammatical meaning of the words is the only safe guide.\n\nd) The provisions of sections 4 to 29 of the Limitation Act, 1963 will apply when -\n\ni) there is a special law or local law which prescribes a different period of limitation for any suit, appeal or application and,\n\nii) the special or local law does not expressly exclude those sections.\n\ne) A mere provision of a period of limitation in howsoever peremptory or imperative language is not sufficient to displace the applicability of section 5.\n\nf) If on an examination of the relevant provisions of the special law, it is clear that the provisions of the Limitation Act are necessarily excluded then the benefits conferred therein cannot be called in aid to supplement the provisions of the Special Act.\n\ng) Where the special law does not exclude the provisions of sections 4 to 24 of the Limitation Act by an express reference, it would nonetheless be open to the court to examine whether and to what extent the nature of the provisions or the nature of the subject matter and the scheme of the special law exclude their operation.\n\nh) If the Special Act and the Limitation Act can be read harmoniously without doing violence to the words used therein then there is no prohibition in doing so.\n\nS.5 of the Limitation Act is applicable to the NPA Act. There is no express exclusion of the Limitation Act. So far as borrower's applications under section 17(1) are concerned, a different period of limitation is prescribed. Hence, on a bare reading of section 29(2), section 5 of the Limitation Act would be applicable to them. So far as the secured creditor is concerned, he can take measures under section 13(4) within the period prescribed under the Limitation Act. Though section 35 gives overriding effect to the NPA Act, section 37 states that application of other laws is not barred and the NPA Act is in addition to DRT Act and not in derogation thereof. It is important to note that under section 17(7), the DRT has to dispose of the applications in accordance with the DRT Act and the rules made thereunder and section 24 of the DRT Act makes provisions of the Limitation Act applicable to the application before the DRT. Since after considering the scheme, provisions and object of the NPA Act, the NPA Act and the DRT Act are held complementary to each other by the Supreme Court in Transcore's case. The provisions of section 5 of the Limitation Act are applicable to the provisions under the NPA Act. This will also lead to even treatment to the secured creditor as well as to the borrower or any aggrieved person. AIR 2006 SC 2525 and AIR 2006 P & H 107 - Ref. to. [Para 68,69,74]"

It is also well settled that long and continuous possession by itself would not constitute adverse possession if it was either permissive possession or possession without animus possidendi. The pleas based on title and adverse possession are mutually inconsistent and the latter does not begin to operate until the former is renounced. Unless the person possessing the property has the requisite animus to possess the property hostile to the title of the true owner, the period for prescription will not commence. When a person is in possession asserting to be the owner, even if he fails to establish his title, his possession would still be adverse to the true owner. Therefore, the two pleas put forth by the defendant in this case are not inconsistent pleas but alternative pleas available on the same facts. Therefore, the contention of the plaintiffs that the plea of adverse possession is not available to defendant is rejected. In this case defendant did not contend that he entered possession under or through the plaintiffs. His case was that he was in possession as a tenant from 1962 and he became the owner by purchasing the plot in 1985. He alternatively contended that if former owner did not have title and consequently his claim based on title was rejected, then having regard to the fact that he had been in possession by setting up title in erstwhile owner and later in himself, his possession was hostile to the true owner; and if he was able to make out such hostile possession continued for more than 12 years, he could claim to have perfected his title by adverse possession. There is considerable force in the contention of defendant provided he is able to establish adverse possession for more than 12 years. When a person is in possession asserting to be the owner, even if he fails to establish his title, his possession would still be adverse to the true owner. Therefore, the two pleas put forth by the defendant in this case are not inconsistent pleas but alternative pleas available on the same facts. Therefore, the contention of the plaintiffs that the plea of adverse possession is not available to defendant is rejected.   [Para 17,18]\n\nIn this case, however, defendant did not make out such possession for 12 years prior to the suit. While the plaintiffs have made out a clear and absolute title of the property, the defendant has not been able to make out title or adverse possession for more than 12 years. The High Court did not examine any of these aspects and by a cursory judgment, reversed the well considered judgment of the trial court. Therefore the decision of High Court could not be sustained.

Ex.B-16 is an alleged receipt dated  9-5-1978,  for payment of \"planning fee\". On the basis of this, it is sought to be contended that an application was made to the Municipality, by the second appellant, for undertaking the construction. The appellants failed to explain as to under what provision the so-called planning fee was paid. The receipt does. not disclose the factum of submission of any construction plan. They did not file any sanctioned plan or certified copy of it. The payment of fee for the purpose of construction becomes relevant, if only the permission was applied for, or was granted. In fact, an adverse inference is also possible to the effect that through the application if filed, it was not entertained, for reasons such as, lack of entitlement of the appellants over the land. If really the appellants enjoyed the possession, as of their right, there would certainly have been record of one nature, or the other, in their support. Their failure to place such a record would render their plea of adverse possession, untenable. The Courts below have recorded findings in this regard on the basis of evidence, and it is impermissible in a second appeal, to appreciate the evidence and to disturb concurrent findings of fact.\t [Para 15]"

Obviously, the power of condonation available under section 5 is given to the Court and not any other body.  The applicability of provisions of Section 5 stands expressly excluded after the expiry of such period.  In the case in hand, the provision specifically states that the appeal cannot be entertained beyond the period of limitation prescribed and further provides that the Authority should not take cognizance of such appeal filed beyond the period of limitation.  This provision, therefore, expressly excludes the applicability of provisions of law comprised under Section 55 of the Limitation Act.  It is also to be noted that the appeal in the case in hand, was required to be presented to the Administrator and the provisions of law comprised under Article 26, read with Article 250 of the Devasthan Regulations disclose that the General Body has to deliberate upon the appeal filed by the party.  It does not provide for the General Body to entertain and deliberate upon the said appeal independently of reference of such application by the Administrator consequent to the summoning of the General Body Meeting by the Administrator.  The provision of Article 250 speaks of only reference of an appeal to the General Body by the Administrator and no other proceedings.  The Administrator performs his only administrative functions which are of ministerial nature and not of judicial or quasi-judicial nature.  Being so, neither the Administrator would have jurisdiction to entertain the appeal nor even condone the delay, nor the General Body could exercise any such power.  This conclusion is inevitable also bearing in mind decision in relation to the role of the Authority referred to above under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act.  Undoubtedly, the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act are different from those under the Devasthan Regulations.  But the decision assumes importance while considering the scope of power of the Administrator under Article 250 and the nature of such power as well as the manner in which the General Body of the Devasthan gets jurisdiction to deal with and deliberate upon the appeal filed by an aggrieved party. 1995(3) SCC 330 and 1996(6) SCC 44 - Referred to. \t\t\t\t\t [Para 13,17,18]"

The instant case is not one which is governed by the provisions of the Limitation Act. The Land Acquisition Collector in making an award does not act as a Court within the meaning of the Limitation Act. It is also clear from the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act that the provisions of the Limitation Act have not been made applicable to proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act in the matter of making an award under Section 11-A of the Act. However, Section 11-A of the Act does provide a period of limitation within which the Collector shall make his award. The explanation thereto also provides for exclusion of the period during which any action or proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the declaration is stayed by an order of a court. Such being the provision, there is no scope for importing into Section 11-A of the Land Acquisition Act the provisions of Section 12 of the Limitation Act. The application of Section 12 of the Limitation Act is also confined to matters enumerated therein. The time taken for obtaining a certified copy of the judgment is excluded because a certified copy is required to be filed while preferring an appeal/revision/review etc. challenging the impugned order. Thus a court is not permitted to read into Section 11A of the Act a provision for exclusion of time taken to obtain a certified copy of the judgment and order. The court has, therefore, no option but to compute the period of limitation for making an award in accordance with the provisions of Section 11-A of the Act after excluding such period as can be excluded under the Explanation to Section 11-A of the Act.  [Para 54]\n\nThe legislature wherever it considered necessary incorporated by express words the rule incorporated in Section 12 of the Limitation Act. It has done so expressly in Section 28-A of the Act while it has consciously not incorporated this rule in Section 11-A even while providing for exclusion of time under the explanation. The intendment of the legislature is therefore unambiguous and does not permit the Court to read words into Section 11-A of the Act so as to enable it to read Section 12 of the Limitation Act into Section 11-A of the Land Acquisition Act.

The reason is obvious that the Appellate Court upon filing of fresh appeal has to be satisfied that the time was spent in prosecuting in good faith the proceedings of writ petition and the proceedings of writ petition are not before it.  Though the provisions of Section 14 are not applicable to an appeal, the cause available under Section 14 can be a sufficient cause under Section 5 of the Limitation Act for condonation of delay.  The only difference is that under Section 14, once it is shown that the applicant was prosecuting in good faith the other proceedings, then he is, as a matter of right, entitled to get excluded the period spent.  In a case under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, the condonation of delay is not as a matter of right, but it is the discretion of the Court. However, when the Court permits the petitioner to convert writ petition into an appeal, it is only upon reaching the satisfaction that the prosecution of writ petition was in good faith and the applicant is entitled to get the benefit of exclusion of such period.  Once the conversion is permitted by the Court, the same relates back to the date of filing of writ petition.  Such conversion is permissible, when the proceedings are prosecuted in the same Court, but in different jurisdiction.  It is not necessary either to file separate application for condonation of delay or to explain the delay from the date of filing writ petition till the date of its conversion.  The reason is obvious that proceedings of writ petition are before the Court.  In such a situation, the period for condonation of delay needs to be counted up to the date of filing of writ petition and not up to the date of the order of conversion of writ petition into an appeal. In the present case, this Court has permitted conversion of writ petition into an appeal against order on 10-7-2009, and hence the delay was required to be explained only up to the stage of filing of writ petition on 22-9-2008. 2006(6) ALL MR 310 - Ref. to.

The filing of an application for condonation of delay at subsequent stage cannot be held to be invalid and filing is permissible till appeal is rejected.  Unintentional lapses of a litigant should not result in closing the doors of the Court permanently.  In addition to this, as pointed out earlier, the mandate of Section 3 of the Limitation Act is to dismiss an appeal filed after the prescribed period, although the limitation has not been set up as a defence.  In view of this provision, the appeal even if admitted without condoning delay, it can be dismissed at the stage of final hearing of the matter and till then it would be open for the appellant to file an application seeking condonation of delay.  The requirement of filing an application for condonation of delay along with memorandum of appeal is not mandatory. 2010(5) Mh.L.J. 262 - Ref. to.  [Para 19]"

The doctrine of merger does not make a distinction between an order of reversal, modification or an order of confirmation passed by the appellate authority. The said doctrine postulates that there cannot be more than one operative decree governing the same subject matter at a given point of time. It is trite that when an appellate Court passes a decree, the decree of the trial Court merges with the decree of the appellate Court and even if and subject to any modification that may be made in the appellate decree, the decree of the appellate Court supersedes the decree of the trial Court. In other words, merger of a decree takes place irrespective of the fact as to whether the appellate Court affirms, modifies or reverses the decree passed by the trial Court. When a special leave petition is dismissed summarily, doctrine of merger does not apply but when an appeal is dismissed, it does. The law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Chandi Prasad Vs. Jagdish Prasad is applicable to the facts of this case. The Judgment/Decree of this Court dated 22-9-2005 has now merged with the Judgment/Decree of the trial Court dated 31-8-2000 and the computation of limitation of three years assuming that the suit was for mandatory injunction had to be computed from 22-9-2005 and the application which was filed on 20-8-2008 was well within time in terms of Article 135 of the Limitation Act. It is to be noted that this is not a case where an application for condonation of delay was rejected, nor a case where review application was rejected or a case where a special leave petition is dismissed summarily. Therefore, the executing Court was not right in rejecting the application for execution. 2005(5) ALL MR 339 (S.C.) - Rel. on.\t\t\t\t  [Para 14,15]"

It is settled position of law that plea of adverse possession must be expressly raised and established. Defendant has to necessarily admit that some one else is owner of the property and further more, according to law, such claimant must clearly plead and establish all the facts which are required to prove adverse possession. One cannot be permitted to raise mutually inconsistent pleas at different stages of the suit to base his claim as sharer in ancestral property and other plea based on adverse possession. Plea as to adverse possession and claim thereof cannot commence unless claimant denounces his title claimed as sharer in joint family property. Defendant no.1 in the present case never denounced his title as son of deceased or as brother of deceased nor he had admitted the ownership title of the plaintiffs to the suit land so as to be permitted to raise a plea of adverse possession. A person who is owner of the property under registered sale deed duly executed is deemed to be lawfully in possession so long as there is no intrusion. Non-user of property by owner even for long time would not affect title of the owner unless claimant to adverse possession has asserted hostile title in denial of title of the true owner peacefully, openly, continuously and for a continuous period of 12 years or more. Looking to this legal position, suit for possession was rightly decided by the Courts below. Substantial question of law formulated by order dated 18th August 1999 by this Court must be answered accordingly to the effect that it was necessary for defendant no.1 to first admit ownership of the plaintiffs to the suit property for to raise plea of adverse possession. He could not have been permitted to raise plea as to adverse possession as he never denounced his claim in the suit as a sharer in joint Hindu family property.      [Para 9]"

'Jural relationship between parties' means legal relationship between parties with reference to their rights and obligations. In a mortgage, both the mortgagor and the mortgagee, have certain rights and obligations against each other. The rights/obligations of a mortgagor or a mortgagee co-exist, like the two sides of a coin. The mortgagor's right of redemption is co-extensive with the mortgagee's right of sale or foreclosure (where such right is recognized in law). Any statement by either, admitting the jural relationship with the other, will extend the limitation for a suit by that other, against the person acknowledging. It follows that when a mortgagee makes a statement about his right to recover the mortgage amount, such statement impliedly acknowledges the corresponding right of redemption of the mortgagor. Further, a statement admitting jural relationship, need not refer to or reiterate the rights and obligations flowing therefrom. Where a party to the mortgage, by his statement, admits the existence of the mortgage or his rights under the mortgage, he admits all legal incidents of the mortgage including rights and obligations of both parties, that is mortgagee and mortgagor.   [Para 18]\n\nIn this case, the operative portion of the deed of assignment dated 12-2-1954 states that in consideration of having received Rs.300/-, the mortgagee was assigning the mortgage under deed dated 7-9-1935 executed in his favour. The deed further states that the assignee was entitled to receive all the amounts as per the original mortgage. The further statement that the assignee is entitled to receive the amount as per the original mortgage is an assertion of the right of the mortgagee against the mortgagor under the mortgage, and consequently, an admission of the subsistence of the mortgage and of the jural relationship between the mortgagee and the mortgagor. It is an acknowledgment under Section 18 of the Act.\t\t\t\t  [Para 22]"

Presumptions and probabilities cannot be substituted for evidence. It must be shown by clear and unequivocal evidence that possession was hostile to its true owner and amounted to a denial of his title to the property claimed. Mere long possession for a period of more than 12 years cannot result in acquisition of title by adverse possession. What is material is 'animus possidendi'. It seems that the learned trial court could not distinguish between the 'possession simplicitor' and 'adverse possession' and therefore fallen in error while recording the finding that the suit is barred by limitation and defendants have perfected title to it by adverse possession.\t    [Para 12]"

                "description": "Condonation of delay - Term \"sufficient cause\" - Even if it is to receive liberal construction it must comply with concept of reasonable time and proper conduct of concerned party.\n\nThe purpose of introducing liberal construction normally is to introduce the concept of 'reasonableness' as it is understood in its general connotation. The law of limitation is a substantive law and has definite consequences on the right and obligation of a party to arise. These principles should be adhered to and applied appropriately depending on the facts and circumstances of a given case. Once a valuable right, as accrued in favour of one party as a result of the failure of the other party to explain the delay by showing sufficient cause and its own conduct, it will be unreasonable to take away that right on the mere asking of the applicant, particularly when the delay is directly a result of negligence, default or inaction of that party. Justice must be done to both parties equally. Then alone the ends of justice can be achieved. If a party has been thoroughly negligent in implementing its rights and remedies, it will be equally unfair to deprive the other party of a valuable right that has accrued to it in law as a result of his acting vigilantly. The application filed by the applicants lack in details. Even the averments made are not correct and ex-facie lack bona fide. The explanation has to be reasonable or plausible, so as to persuade the Court to believe that the explanation rendered is not only true, but is worthy of exercising judicial discretion in favour of the applicant. If it does not specify any of the enunciated ingredients of judicial pronouncements, then the application should be dismissed. On the other hand, if the application is bona fide and based upon true and plausible explanations, as well as reflect normal behaviour of a common prudent person on the part of the applicant, the Court would normally tilt the judicial discretion in favour of such an applicant. Liberal construction cannot be equated with doing injustice to the other party. 2004(5) ALL MR (S.C.) 1101 - Held per incurium.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 13]"

These provisions give the Courts enough power and discretion to apply a law in a meaningful manner, while assuring that the purpose of enacting such a law does not stand frustrated. The party should show that besides acting bona fide, it had taken all possible steps within its power and control and had approached the Court without any unnecessary delay.

That apart, the first one warrants strict approach whereas the second calls for a liberal delineation.\n\n(ix)The conduct, behaviour and attitude of a party relating to its inaction or negligence are relevant factors to be taken into consideration. It is so as the fundamental principle is that the courts are required to weigh the scale of balance of justice in respect of both parties and the said principle cannot be given a total go by in the name of liberal approach.\n\n(x)If the explanation offered is concocted or the grounds urged in the application are fanciful, the courts should be vigilant not to expose the other side unnecessarily to face such a litigation. (xi) It is to be borne in mind that no one gets away with fraud, misrepresentation or interpolation by taking recourse to the technicalities of law of limitation.\n\n(xii) The entire gamut of facts are to be carefully scrutinized and the approach should be based on the paradigm of judicial discretion which is founded on objective reasoning and not on individual perception.\n\n(xiii) The State or a public body or an entity representing a collective cause should be given some acceptable latitude. \n\nTo the aforesaid principles we may add some more guidelines taking note of the present day scenario. They are: -\n\n(a) An application for condonation of delay should be drafted with careful concern and not in a half hazard manner harbouring the notion that the courts are required to condone delay on the bedrock of the principle that adjudication of a lis on merits is seminal to justice dispensation system.\n\n(b) An application for condonation of delay should not be dealt with in a routine manner on the base of individual philosophy which is basically subjective.\n\n(c) Though no precise formula can be laid down regard being had to the concept of judicial discretion, yet a conscious effort for achieving consistency and collegiality of the adjudicatory system should be made as that is the ultimate institutional motto.\n\n(d) The increasing tendency to perceive delay as a non-serious matter and, hence, lackadaisical propensity can be exhibited in a non-challant manner requires to be curbed, of course, within legal parameters.\n\nTo the aforesaid culled from case law some more guidelines taking of the present day scenario can be added as under\"\n\n(a) An application for condonation of delay should be drafted with careful concern and not in a half hazard manner harbouring the notion that the courts are required to condone delay on the bedrock of the principle that adjudication of a lis on merits is seminal to justice dispensation system.\n\n(b) An application for condonation of delay should not be dealt with in a routine manner on the base of individual philosophy which is basically subjective.\n\n(c) Though no precise formula can be laid down regard being had to the concept of judicial discretion, yet a conscious effort for achieving consistency and collegiality of the adjudicatory system should be made as that is the ultimate institutional motto.\n\n(d) The increasing tendency to perceive delay as a non-serious matter and, hence, lackadaisical propensity can be exhibited in a non-challant manner requires to be curbed, of course, within legal parameters.

The limitation under Article 65 therefore starts from the point when the possession of the Defendant becomes adverse to the Plaintiff. Hence in so far as Article 65 is concerned, the onus is on the Defendant to prove that he is in adverse possession, as that is the only ground on which the Plaintiff can be nonsuited, on the ground of limitation if the suit is filed 12 years after the Defendant's possession becomes adverse to the Plaintiff. In so far as adverse possession is concerned, one of the requirements is that it has to be claimed and has to be put in issue and that there has to be proof of hostile possession which is open and continuous and to the knowledge of the public at large. If one comes to the facts of the instant case, the written statement does not contain any such averment. In fact the Petitioner was required to file a counter claim if it was its case that it was claiming a right on the basis of adverse possession. No such counter claim was filed, neither is any averment appearing in the written statement. The sine qua non if one can say of adverse possession is hostility to the title of the true owner, no such fact is pleaded nor brought on record to prove such hostility though the Petitioner herein claims to be in possession since the year 1976. Hence the Petitioner has not satisfied the test of adverse possession and therefore the finding of the Co-operative Appellate Court that in view of the fact that the Petitioner is in unauthorized possession meaning thereby a trespasser the cause of action was continuous and the Dispute therefore filed in the year 1993 was within limitation cannot be faulted with. \t\t\t\t [Para 22]"

This Court has time and again held that when mandatory provision is not complied with and that delay is not properly, satisfactorily and convincingly explained, the court cannot condone the delay on sympathetic grounds alone. if some person has taken a relief approaching the Court just or immediately after the cause of action had arisen, other persons cannot take benefit thereof approaching the court at a belated stage for the reason that they cannot be permitted to take the impetus of the order passed at the behest of some diligent person.

His possession was therefore not adverse to said female heir.  Because of explanation (b) such possession of defendant during lifetime of such woman is excluded for the purposes of computing limitation and hence, by deeming fiction, only after death of such limited owner, legislature has recognised it as becoming adverse to the plaintiff thereby requiring filing of suit within twelve years from the date of death of such woman.  There was no cause for Plaintiff to file any suit.  If a person inducted by limited owner accepts title of reversioner after death of such limited owner, revisioner will have no cause to treat his possession as adverse to him.  Hence, explanation (b) of Article 65 is not at all relevant here and defendant has to demonstrate that he was in adverse possession as against present Plaintiff for twelve years.  Article 65 of present Limitation Act have no application in the facts of this case and Suit as filed by original Plaintiff in 1982 cannot be said to be barred by limitation insofar as his claim as revisioner is concerned.  Further the plea and claim as reversioner raised by Appellant Plaintiff for the first time in Second Appeal, and present Respondent/original Defendant did not get opportunity to point out facts negating it.  Matter restored back to the file of said court only to consider the issue of reversion arising from amended pleadings of parties and to answer it in accordance with law after giving them reasonable opportunity.\t [Para 8,9]"

In most cases, involving condonation of delay, it is possible that there is some amount of negligence on the part of the litigants. However, that by itself, is not enough to turn down the plea of such litigants and to shut the door against them. If the explanation does not smack of malafides or is not put forth as part of dilatory tactic, the Court must show utmost consideration to the suitors. However, whilst condoning the delay, the Court should not forget the opposite part altogether. It must be borne in mind that the opposite party is also a looser and the opposite party too, would have to incur quite a large litigation expense. Therefore, it would be a salutary guideline that when, the court condones the delay, the Court must compensate the opposite party for its loss. \t [Para 13]\n\n\tThe Court must be more discerning and considerate particularly when delay is not inordinate and explanation, not malafide. The litigants usually rely upon their lawyers for such procedural compliances. The lawyers in turn entrust such matters to their juniors or clerks. These are some of the practical issues, which, though cannot be granted some blanket judicial sanction, cannot be altogether ignored either. Further, in the instant case, the appellants/petitioners had nothing to gain by delaying their own appeal. The primary function of the Court is to adjudicate the dispute between the parties and to advance substantial justice. Such procedural requirements are basically required to ensure that there is compliance with natural justice and the parties do not resort to dilatory tactics. In dealing with applications for condonation of delay the overall conduct of the party has to examined. Unless it is established that a litigant has been irresponsible or grossly negligent, the Courts must show utmost consideration to the suitors.\t\t [Para 14]"

Not only that, but in 1946 Reg.C.S. No.24-A of 1946 for possession came to be filed which was decreed in favour of plaintiffs and therefore the adverse possession did not get ripen.\n\n(iii) The defendants claimed to be tenants. Thus the entry in the land itself is permissible and referable to the lawful title. Therefore adverse possession could not be claimed by the defendants. There is no pleading and evidence as to when the possession of the defendants became adverse to the plaintiffs. Not only that, but the fact of discontinuance or date of dispossession of the plaintiffs is not accepted by the defendants. On the contrary, the defendants are coming with a case that they are continuously in possession of the property and, therefore, there is no dispossession or discontinuance of the plaintiffs' possession. The defendants were under obligation to point out as to at what point of time, they started claiming possession adverse to the knowledge of the true owner. Pleading and evidence in this respect is absent and further-more, Articles 141, 142 and 144 of the Limitation Act, 1908 will have no application in the facts and circumstances of the case, because civil suit came to be filed in the year 1946 and decree for possession came to be passed in the said suit which, according to the plaintiffs, was executed in the year 1950-51. The cause of action if at all as contemplated under Article 142 or Article 144, has never taken place so as to hold that the period of limitation provided under these two Articles has expired prior to the coming into force the Limitation Act, 1963. Therefore, it could not be said that the suit for possession filed after commencement of the 1963 Act was not tenable in view of S.31 of that Act.  [Para 11,15]"

Delay is liable to be condoned.\n\n1987(2) SCC 107, 1996 (2) SCC 568, 2002(2) ALL MR 588 (S.C.), 2005(2) ALL MR 268, 2010(6) ALL MR 480 (S.C.), AIR 1965 SC 1794 Referred. \t\t           [Para 12,13]"

The distinction between Article 58 and Article 113 is, thus, apparent inasmuch as the right to sue may accrue to a suitor in a given case at different points of time and, thus, whereas in terms of Article 58 the period of limitation would be reckoned from the date on which the cause of action arose first, whereas, in the latter the period of limitation would be differently computed depending upon the last day when the cause of action therefor arose.

It further stipulates that the period of limitation shall start running from the date when the person 'first learns' about the conversion of the moveable property. While it is true that the word used in the said Article is \"first learns\" and not knowledge, it is difficult to construe the word \"first learns\" without attributing to it certain degree of knowledge. The provision of Article 91 (a) of the Limitation Act thus demands two things. First is knowledge on the part of the plaintiff, and second, that the said fact be within his peculiar knowledge. The term \"first learns\" places a burden of knowledge which is rather specific in nature. Thus, the knowledge must be of the identity of a specific person in whose possession the bonds are and that he acquired the possession of the said bonds under an arrangement, which in law would constitute wrongful conversion. The knowledge of a specific person against whom the suit can be instituted is what is crucial here. A mere suspicion or a whisper of knowledge is not enough for the period of limitation to start running. \t\t\t\t    [Para 18]"

Thus, the period of limitation of three years mentioned in Article 54 will start to run from the date of cause of action which can be ascertained on the basis of aforesaid two circumstances. In this case, even after it is presumed that time was not essence of contract, the plaintiff ought to have filed suit within reasonable time from the date of agreement. It ought to have presumed by plaintiff that the promisor had refused to perform her part of the contract. However, the pleadings and the contents of the agreement shows that the time of four months was fixed and no explanation is given by the plaintiff as to why there was such mention in the agreement. In view of these circumstances, for the present matter, it can be said that the time started to run after expiry of four months, which need to be counted from the date of agreement. \t\t [Para 9,13]"

If it is held that the non-impleadment of a defendant in the previous proceedings does not matter at all if some of the co-defendants only were parties in the previous proceedings, it may lead to serious prejudice in some cases. Under some of the enactments, a shorter period of limitation is provided for institution of the proceedings than the one provided by the Schedule to the Limitation Act, 1963. For example, the Major Port Trusts Act, 1963 provides a shorter period of limitation for institution of the proceedings against a Port Trust. If in respect of cause of action against a Port Trust and a private party, a proceeding is instituted against a private party and later on withdrawn with liberty to institute a fresh proceeding on the same cause of action and, in the meanwhile, the period of limitation prescribed by the statute against the Port Trust expires, the grant of benefit of section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963, despite the Port Trust being not a party to the previous proceeding, would run counter to the statutory scheme under the special enactment.

Act.\n\nArticle 61 refers to right to redeem or recover possession. While right of mortgagor to redeem is dealt with under Section 60 of the T.P. Act, the right of usufructuary mortgagor to recover possession is specially dealt with under Section 62. Section 62 is applicable only to usufructuary mortgages and not to any other mortgage. The said right of usufructuary mortgagor though styled as 'right to recover possession' is for all purposes, right to redeem and to recover possession. Thus, while in case of any other mortgage, right to redeem is covered under Section 60, in case of usufructuary mortgage, right to recover possession is dealt with under Section 62 and commences on payment of mortgage money out of the usufructs or partly out of the usufructs and partly on payment or deposit by the mortgagor. This distinction in a usufructuary mortgage and any other mortgage is clearly borne out from provisions of Sections 58, 60 and 62 of the T.P. Act read with Article 61 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act. Usufructuary mortgage cannot be treated at par with any other mortgage, as doing so will defeat the scheme of Section 62 of the T.P. Act and the equity. This right of the usufructuary mortgagor is not only an equitable right, it has statutory recognition under Section 62 of the T.P. Act. There is no principle of law on which this right can be defeated. Any contrary view, which does not take into account the special right of usufructuary mortgagor under Section 62 of the T.P. Act, has to be held to be erroneous on this ground or has to be limited to a mortgage other than a usufructuary mortgage.\n\n1985 (4) SCC 162 Disting.\n\n2006(3) ALL MR 175 (S.C.), AIR 2012 (HP) 1 (FB) Overruled.

The necessary conditions are-\n\n1)  \tthere must be a contract to transfer for consideration any immovable property;\n\n2)  \tthe contract must be in writing, signed by the transferor, or by someone on his behalf;\n\n3) \tthe writing must be in such words from which the terms necessary to construe the transfer can be ascertained;\n\n4) \tthe transferee must in part performance of the contract take possession of the property, or of any part thereof;\n\n5) \tthe transferee must have done some act in furtherance of the contract; and\n\n6) \tthe transferee must have performed or be willing to perform his part of the contract.  \t\t\t [Para 14]\n\nIf the conditions enumerated above are complied with, the law of limitation does not come in the way of a defendant taking plea under S. 53-A of the Act to protect his possession of the suit property even though a suit for specific performance of a contract was barred by limitation.\t\t [Para 15]\n\nThe matter may be examined from another angle. The established rule of limitation is that law of limitation is not applicable to a plea taken in defence unless expressly a provision is made in the statute. The law of limitation applies to the suits and applications. The various articles of the Limitation Act show that they do not apply to a defence taken by a defendant In suit. Thus, the law of limitation bars only an action in a Court of law. In fact, what the Limitation Act does is, to take away the remedy of a plaintiff to enforce his rights by bringing an action in a Court of law, but it does not place any restriction to a defendant to put forward any defence though such defence as a claim made by him may be barred by limitation and cannot be enforced in a Court of law. On the said principle, a defendant in a suit can put forward any defence though such defence may not be enforceable in a Court of law, being barred by limitation.\t\t\t [Para 16]"

Perusal of sub-section (2) of Section 30 of the RDDBFI Act, indicate that for the Debts Recovery Appellate Tribunal, entertaining appeal against the order of the Recovery Officer, the only precaution seems to observe the principle of natural justice, while Tribunal can expeditiously inquire and dispose of the appeal by passing an appropriate order after examining the validity of the order passed by the Recovery officer following the procedure contained in section 25 to 28 (both inclusive).\n2008(2) ALL MR 512 Disting.

The policy stated here is at least as clear as the one held in Harishanker Bagla's case offering sufficient guidance to the Central Government in exercising its powers under that Act. Further, S. 48 (3) of the Life Insurance Corporation Act requires that every rule made by the Central Government under this Act shall be laid before each House of Parliament and that if both Houses agree in making any modification in the rule or both Houses agree that the rule should not be made, the rule shall thereafter have effect only in such modified form or be of no effect, as the case may be. This makes it perfectly clear that Parliament has in no way abdicated its authority, but is keeping strict vigilance and control over its delegate. Therefore the Amendment Act of 1981 and the Rules framed by Central Govt. subsequent to such Amendment cannot be held to be invalid on the ground of excessive delegation of legislative functions.

Meaning thereby, if a paper lottery is being prohibited by a particular State then that paper lottery has to be prohibited as a whole. Likewise, if online or internet lottery is to be prohibited by a State then that online lottery or internet lottery of all States including that State also has to be prohibited. Viewed from this angle, State of Kerala was well within its rights to prohibit the sale of online or internet lotteries in its State and there is no fault in it. It is well within the powers conferred on it under Section 5 of the Act. A State Government can organize, conduct or promote a lottery subject to conditions mentioned in Section 4 and if there is any violation of the conditions mentioned in Section 4, it would be always open to the State Government to prohibit such lottery and that would be within the legislative power vested with the State under Section 5 of the Act as in that case the State would be only complying with the provisions of the Act made by the Parliament.\n\nThe State can prohibit any form of lottery, if only it is not running any lottery at all. The second interpretation is that the State can prohibit a particular form of lottery, if it is not running that form of lottery, even if it is running other types of lotteries. The Act has been designedly made to suppress the mischief of lottery. Therefore, an interpretation, which advances the object of the Act, should be favoured. That means, the State can prohibit online lotteries, if it is not running the said type of lotteries.\n\n(1999) 9 SCC 700 Rel.on.        [Para 38,39]"

The act of the petitioner to start social club/card room cannot be termed as illegal or contrary to procedure rather it is in consonance with the procedure provided for by the respondents. There is no denial that, there is a time limit for considering the application and communicating the decision on such application and therefore, it can safely be concluded that, the action of the police department to register N.C. against the petitioner trust was arbitrary exercise of the powers vested in the concerned authorities. Therefore, relying upon the said non cognizable offence registered against the petitioner, the respondents could not have said in affidavit in reply that, in view of registration of non cognizable offence against the petitioner, the permission cannot be granted. It is crystal clear that, the respondents have created the aforesaid ground by registering the non cognizable offence against the petitioner trust, so as to refuse premises licence on that ground to the petitioner. Therefore, such ground created by the respondent authorities so as to deny premises licence to the petitioner cannot sustain and on that ground, the respondent could not have refused the premises licence.\n\nRejection of the licence must be founded upon relevant grounds of public interest. Fair play and natural justice are part of fair public administration; non-arbitrariness and absence of discrimination are hallmarks for good governance under rule of law.\n\nTherefore, the respondent could not have rejected the application for premises licence to run social club/card room on the ground that, the members of the petitioner society/trust have not submitted income tax returns, audit report, not disclosing the source of income for organizing funds etc. In the facts of this case, taking into consideration the material placed on record including replies filed by the respondents, there is no manner of doubt that, the respondents were bent upon to search irrelevant reasons/conditions/requirements so as to reject the application of the petitioner for premises licence though such conditions/requirements have no place either in the statute or rules. \t\t\t     [Para 22,28,29]"

The framing of the Amendment Bill; reference of the same to the Parliamentary Standing Committee; the consideration thereof by the said Committee; the report prepared alongwith further steps that are required to be taken and the time frame thereof are essential legislative functions which should not be ordinarily subjected to interference or intervention of the Court. The constitutional doctrine of separation of powers and the demarcation of the respective jurisdiction of the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary under the constitutional framework would lead the Court to the conclusion that the exercise of the amendment of the Act, which is presently underway, must be allowed to be completed without any intervention of the Court. Any other view and any interference, at this juncture, would negate the basic constitutional principle that the Legislature is supreme in the sphere of law making. Reading down a statute to make it workable in a situation where an exercise of amendment of the law is pending will not be justified either. A perception, however, strong of the imminent need of the law en-grafted in the Act and its beneficial effects on the citizenry of a democratic country, by itself, will not permit the Court to overstep its jurisdiction.

If, at present, the LOP is not available, surely, the Chairperson and the other two Members of the Selection Committee, namely, the Speaker of the Lok Sabha and the Chief Justice of India or his nominee may proceed to appoint an eminent jurist as a Member of the Selection Committee under Section 4(1)(e) of the Act. Even no legal disability in a truncated Selection Committee to constitute a Search Committee for preparing a panel of persons for consideration for appointment as the Chairperson and Members of the Lokpal and also for such a truncated Selection Committee to make recommendations to the President of India for appointment of the Chairperson and Members of the Lokpal. True, there is no specific provision akin to sub-section (2) of Section 4 of the Act insofar as the constitution of the Search Committee by a truncated Selection Committee is concerned. But the absence of such a provision, by itself, will not invalidate the constitution of the Search Committee by the truncated Selection Committee when the Act specifically \"empowers\" a truncated Selection Committee to make recommendations for appointment of the Chairperson or Members of the Lokpal. To hold otherwise would be self contradictory. The amendment to Section 4(3), as proposed, would, therefore, be clarificatory and will not amount to an attempt to cure a shortcoming in the Act which is proving to be an inhibition in law to the appointment of the Chairperson/ Members of the Lokpal.\t [Para 19]\n\n\tFurther Amendment Bill seeks the inclusion of Leader of the largest Opposition Party in Lok Sabha in the Selection Committee, in lieu of LOP. The proposed amendments also seek to limit the tenure of the eminent jurist, as a Member of the Selection Committee. There is also an explicit recital of the fact that the absence of any Member of the Selection Committee (or a vacancy in the post of any Member) will not invalidate the recommendations of the Selection Committee for appointment of the Chairperson or Member of the Lokpal or the appointment of the eminent jurist. Similarly, appointment of a Member of the Search Committee or the proceedings of the said Committee will not be invalid by reason of either the absence of a Member of the Search Committee or a vacancy in the Selection Committee.\n\n\tWhile the Parliamentary Standing Committee had made various recommendations in respect of the proposed amendments, so far as the amendment relating to substitution of the LOP by the Leader of the single largest opposition party in the Lok Sabha is concerned, the Parliamentary Standing Committee had approved the proposed amendment. Insofar as the discharge of functions by the Search/Selection Committee in a situation where there exits a vacancy, the Parliamentary Standing Committee is of the view that the Search/Selection Committee should not take any decision unless the vacancy in the Search/Selection Committee is filled up. Rather, it is suggested that provisions should be made in the Amendment Bill for filling up such vacancy/vacancies at the earliest. \t [Para 14]\n\n\tThe view of the Parliamentary Standing Committee with regard to the expediency of the Search/Selection Committee taking decisions when vacancy/vacancies exists/exist is merely an opinion with which the Executive, in the first instance, has to consider and, thereafter, the legislature has to approve. The said opinion of the Parliamentary Standing Committee would therefore not be sacrosanct. The same, in any case, does not have any material bearing on the validity of the existing provisions of the Act. \t  [Para 19]"

                "description": "Bombay High Court (Original Side) Rules (1980), Part III, Rr.941, 946(2) - Bunkers on board a vessel - Cannot be arrested without any claim against vessel and independent of vessel - High Court has no in rem jurisdiction to arrest bunkers on board a ship.\n\nLetters Patent nowhere provides that bunkers can be arrested without any claim against the vessel and independent of the vessel. \"The Letters Patent is a procedural law to facilitate exercise of jurisdiction in aid of a substantive law\". No procedural law can vest jurisdiction which is not provided under substantive law. Though bunkers could be termed necessaries supplied to the vessel, the question herein is not claim against the vessel but it is the claim against the bunker on board with no claim against the vessel and independent of the vessel. Therefore, even if the bunkers supplied are necessaries and for a claim of necessaries, a vessel could be arrested, the same principle cannot be applied to arrest only the bunkers when there is no claim against the vessel and independent of the vessel. \t [Para 8,9]\n\nIf bunkers were property against which the suit could be brought in rem, then the manner of service of writ of summons or warrant of arrest of bunkers would also have been specifically provided not like what the Plaintiff's counsel submitted that if no property other than a ship, cargo or freight could be arrested, the rules would have said so expressly. The rules indicate which are the only properties against which a suit in rem can be brought and bunker is not one of the property. \t [Para 12]\n\nWhilst freight and cargo are considered as maritime property, bunkers are not and hence arrest of bunkers is not permissible irrespective of whether there is a maritime claim or lien against the vessel. Bunkers cannot be considered as maritime property independent of the ship. Bunkers are part of the ship and not capable of independent arrest. In the event the bunkers belong to the charterer against whom the Plaintiff has a maritime claim, the Plaintiff has no remedy by way of arrest of bunkers and the Plaintiff must pursue its claim against the charterer by adopting such other remedies as are available in law. Any alleged lien over the bunkers as provided in the bunker sales contract is of no consequence. It is a contractual lien at best and does not bind a person who is not a party to the contract. This does not give the Plaintiff any right to arrest the bunkers on board the vessel nor does it entitle the Plaintiff to proceed in rem against the bunkers. Arrest of bunkers effectively results in arrest of the ship although there is no claim against the shipowner. Thus the ship owner, who is a third party, is seriously prejudiced and would suffer substantial loss. Ordinarily Courts do not make an order that causes serious prejudice to a third party. In such a situation, the interests of the third party far outweigh the interests of a Plaintiff who is seeking to secure its claim against the buyer of the bunkers. It is also no answer for the Plaintiff's counsel to say in such a situation that it will provide appropriate undertakings to compensate the ship owner for detention of its vessel or that it is open to the ship owner to recover charter hire from the charterer for the period the vessel is detained due to an order of arrest of bunkers. \t [Para 21,24]"

Sub-rule (4) by implication therefore provides that if the appellate court is the High Court, and it chooses to dismiss a first appeal at the stage of preliminary hearing, without issuing notice to the respondent and without calling for records, it need not deliver a formal brief judgment as is required by other appellate fora. A 'judgment', even a brief one, which is required to be rendered by appellate courts other than High Courts, should necessarily refer to the pleadings, nature of relief, the points for consideration and the decision thereon. But sub-rule (4) does not say that if the appellate court which dismisses the appeal is the High Court, no reasons be assigned for dismissing the appeal. Sub-Rule (4) of Rule 11 does not enable the High Court to dismiss first appeals by one line orders to the effect that 'appeal is dismissed' or by non-speaking orders. The order of the High Court dismissing the first appeal should be sufficiently reasoned to disclose the application of mind to the grounds of appeal and make out that the High Court was resorting to dismissal in limine as it found the appeal either to be vexatious or wholly without merit. Order 41, Rule 11 of the Code, while relieving the High Court from the obligation to write a 'judgment', does not dispense with the obligation to assign reasons in brief, when summarily dismissing the appeal.  1983(4) SCC 223, AIR 2000 SC 3578 - Rel.on.  \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 6]"

Act, before possession of land is taken and even before compensation is determined, Collector is required to hear and consult land owners/persons interested and thus there is participation of land owners in the process of determination of compensation - Unless and until compensation is determined, award cannot be passed - However, Scheme of Coal Bearing Act appears to be totally different - Determination of market value or compensation is not the purpose of opportunity given under S.8 of Coal Bearing Act.\n\nIn Land Acquisition Act before the possession of land is taken and even before the compensation is determined, the Collector is required to hear and consult the land owners/persons interested and thus there is participation of land owners in the process of determination of compensation. Until and unless the compensation is determined, award cannot be passed.\n\nHowever, the Scheme of Coal Bearing Act appears to be totally different. Under Section 4 thereof, the Central Government is authorised to issue preliminary notification declaring its intention to prospect for coal in any area and Section 4 also provides for powers of Competent Authorities after such preliminary notification is declared. Section 7(1) requires Central Government to issue further notice of its intention to acquire whole or any part of the land covered under Section 4 notification if government decides to acquire it or acquire rights in or over any such land. Section 8 then permits person interested in such land to raise objection to such acquisition and competent authority has thereafter to give the objector an opportunity of being heard either in person or by a legal practitioner and thereafter it has to make report to Central Government in this respect. From view of Hon'ble Apex Court in AIR 1970 S.C. 1223 - National Coal Development Corpn. Ltd. Vs. Manmohan Mathur, it is clear that this opportunity is equivalent to one under Section 5-A of Land Acquisition Act & determination of market value or compensation is not its purpose. Provision in Rule 5-A of Coal Bearing Areas (Acquisition and Development) Rules, 1957 for filing of claims by persons interested in compensation with authority prescribed thereunder also shows that the present appellants are statutorily entitled to raise claim for compensation as per Section 13(5) after publication of notification under Section 9 of Coal Bearing Act. After report under Section 8 read with Rule 4 of the Rules, under Section 9 the Central Government can make & publish a notification declaring that the lands are being acquired. Under Section 10, after such declaration is published in official gazette as per Section 9(2), the land or right in that land vests absolutely in Central Government free from encumbrances. Section 12 thereafter permits Competent Authority to require any person in possession of any land acquired under this Act to surrender or deliver possession thereof.  2005(1) ALL MR 109 - Ref. to.

In the present case, two pieces of land, that is, land Survey Nos.22/2-1, admeasuring about 41 Ares, along with another land Survey No.26/1-A/1-A-2 to the extent of 53 Ares, were in possession of the Petitioner as a mortgagee.  Admittedly, both these lands have been reconveyed by the Petitioner prior to the issuance of the Notification under Sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act.  Thus, these two lands, held by the Petitioner as a mortgagee, cannot be said to be his 'holding' within the definition of sub-section (10) of Section 2 of the said Act of 1976.  As stated above, the two lands held by petitioner as a mortgagee, have been reconveyed by him in favour of the mortgagor before issuance of Notification under sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act.  Apart therefrom, while considering the holding of a person under the provisions of the said Act of 1976, if some land/lands are being held by any person as a mortgagee in possession, those lands cannot be treated to be part of 'holding' of that person, reason being that, in accordance with the terms of the document of mortgage, the land held by a person as a mortgage in possession, is being held by such person for a particular period mentioned in the said document, or in accordance with the provisions of law.  For this reason also, the lands held by the petitioner as a mortgagee cannot be treated or considered as lands held by him.  The holding of the Petitioner in the present case was only to the extent of 2 Hector 66 Ares and, therefore, not liable for acquisition.

No doubt that vesting of land in the Government or in the planning authority, either under the provisions of sections 16 and 17 of the Land Acquisition Act or under section 129 of the Act of 1966, takes place only on taking of actual possession of the land or plot of land.  However, the presence of owners or occupant of land is not necessary to effectuate the taking of possession.  The use and occupation of the plot by the occupant or owner thereafter, at the most, may be treated as unauthorised and will be sufficient to say that land/plot vested in the acquiring body.

Decision of Supreme Court in Sant Joginder Singh Kishan Singh, 1995 Supp (2) SCC 475 requires reconsideration by larger Bench.\n\nThe provisions introduced in the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 by Central Act 68 of 1984 can be read into an acquisition under Chap. VII of the M.R.T.P. Act, to the extent not precluded by M.R.T.P. Act, 1966. Section 11-A being one such section, it may have to be applied to the acquisition under Chap. VII of the M.R.T.P. Act. There appears to be no good reason to shut out or preclude the amendments introduced by Central Act 68 of 1984 in the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 from applying to an acquisition under Chap. VII of the M.R.T.P. Act. Or else, the consequence would be that, in respect of two landholders there would be arbitrary discrimination in the matter of acquisition of their lands, merely because in one case the acquisition is by the direct route of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 and, in another case, through the indirect route of the M.R.T.P. Act. If the provisions of the M.R.T.P. Act are not so read then it would be open to the authorities, after issuing a declaration under sub-section (3), to go into hibernation and leave the matter hanging in perpetuity. That certainly would seriously affect the rights of the landholder preventing him from developing the land or alienating it, merely because the authority chooses to act under one Act instead of the other. This again, would attract the wrath of Art.14 of the Constitution, not only on account of discrimination, but also on account of arbitrariness.  [Para 18,21]"

Merely because the Corporation is a successor or is created legally or technically on a date subsequent to the pronouncement of the Award by itself cannot be a ground for holding that the said Corporation or company would not be entitled to the similar right and obligations as are contemplated in acquisition laws. The proceedings before the SLAO under Section 28-A of the Act are fresh proceedings for awarding of compensation and the Collector is under obligation to give notice to all interested persons in terms of Section 28-A(2) of the Act. In the present case, right from the beginning the land has been acquired for a public purpose, namely, Kadva Project, and in continuation of the same public purpose, a Corporation was established by the State being  Godavari Marathwada Irrigation Development Corporation by a legislative Act issued by the competent Legislature. Merely because this Corporation was established in the year 1998 and the Award of the Joint District Judge was passed on 7th April, 1995 per se cannot be a ground for rejecting the claim of the Corporation of being heard before the SLAO in proceedings under Section 28-A or in the Appeals, if preferred against the judgment of the Reference Court.   While considering the case for enhancement of compensation under Section 28-A of the Act, the SLAO is expected to appreciate the evidence and has to examine whether the lands of the Claimants before him are entitled to similar or identical compensation  as awarded to the owners of the land by the Reference Court or any other Court of competent jurisdiction. The Scheme of Section 28-A is that the Collector on receipt of an application under sub-section (1) would conduct an enquiry after giving notice to the interested persons and giving them reasonable opportunity of being heard, would make  the Award. Proceedings Section 28-A are for redetermination of compensation by the SLAO himself.   (2004)12 SCC 96 and (2002)3 SCC 228 - Rel. on.\t [Para 12,13,16]"

Section 127 permitted inaction on the part of the acquisition authorities for a period of 10 years for de-reservation of the land. It gives a further time for either to acquire the land or take steps for acquisition of the land within a period of six months from the date of service of notice by the landowner for dereservation. The \"steps\" towards commencement of the acquisition in such a situation would necessarily be the steps for acquisition and not a step which may not result into acquisition and merely for the purpose of seeking time so that Section 127 does not come into operation.  [Para 10]\n\nThe publication of the declaration under sub-sections (2) and (4) of Section 126 of the MRTP Act, read with Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act is a sine qua non for the commencement of any proceedings for acquisition under the MRTP Act. In other words, it is section 6 declaration, as observed by the Supreme Court in Girnar's case, which commences the acquisition proceedings under the MRTP Act and culminates into passing of an award as provided in sub-section (3) of Section 126 of the RTP Act. Thus, unless and until Section 6 declaration is issued, it cannot be said that the \"steps\" for acquisition are commenced.  [Para 11]\n\nTherefore, by no stretch of imagination, the steps taken viz. Passing of resolution by the council, asking the Chief Officer to take further steps, could be taken to be the \"steps\" for acquisition. 2007 ALL SCR 2232 - Rel. on.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 12]"

The 12.5 percent scheme, however, was an additional means for providing rehabilitation to PAPs. The lands were acquired in the present case for the development of the township of Navi Mumbai. The lands which have been acquired have been or, as the case may be, are being put to that use. Planned development would not be possible if PAPs were to insist that the lands which are to be allotted to them under the 12.5 percent scheme should be from the very same village from which the lands were acquired. Therefore, CIDCO is justified in contending that while initially an attempt is made, where practicable and feasible to allot land within the same villages under the 12.5 percent scheme, but considering the area required for allotment, certain linkage sectors were identified in the nearby villages. Kamothe node in which the Petitioner is to be allotted the balance of the land is stated to be near Asudgaon village.

Section 33(5) rests content by pointing its finger to the relevant provision of the Land Acquisition Act for the purpose of guiding the Collector in determining the amount of compensation to be awarded to the persons whose lands are acquired under the provisions of the M.I.D. Act 61.  It is significant to note that the entire old S.33(5) which contained principles meant for guiding the Collector in determining compensation was substituted by new S.33(5) by Maharashtra Act 11 of 67.  The statement of objects and reasons of Maharashtra Act 11 of 67 by which this section was substituted shows the obvious intention of the legislature namely to remove discrimination and ensure that The persons concerned get compensation by following the ordinary law.  Therefore, if there is subsequent amendment in the Land Acquisition Act contemplating enhanced compensation, or rate of interest the same would be applicable to acquisitions under M.I.D. Act also.  The language of this section taken alongwith the objects and reasons of the amending Act leave no manner of doubt that the provisions of Sections 23 and 24 of the Land Acquisition Act are adopted by reference in the M.I.D.

Act and S.28 of Land Acquisition Act it would be clear that these Sections are absolutely distinct and separate provisions independent of each other.  Their area of operation is different.  Firstly, Section 34 is a direction to the State Government to pay interest at the rate of 4% if the amount of compensation is not paid or deposited before taking possession of the land.  It is, thus, a direction to the State Government.  In the M.I.D. Act, the State Government can take possession under Section 32(5) even before making an award for getting compensation.  Therefore, to compensate a person for the loss which will be caused to him if his possession is taken earlier and compensation is paid subsequently, the said provision is enacted.  Section 28 of the Land Acquisition Act arises only when a reference is made to the District Court.  It is pertinent to note that by the said section, District Court can award interest only on excess amount which he decides to award.  Thus, these provisions are totally distinct and different provisions and, therefore, the submission that in respect of interest there is a specific provision under the M.I.D. Act and, therefore, Section 28 is not applicable is totally incorrect.  [Para 20]"

                "description": "Provisions of Land Acquisition Act so far as they provide different time frames and consequences of default thereof including lapsing of acquisition proceedings cannot be read into Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act - S.11-A being one such provision cannot be applied to acquisitions under Act.\n\nThe MRTP Act is a self-contained code. Further, provisions introduced in the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 by Central Act 68 of 1984, limited to the extent of acquisition of land, payment of compensation and recourse to legal remedies provided under the said Act, can be read into an acquisition controlled by the provisions of Chapter VII of the MRTP Act but with a specific exception that the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act in so far as they provide different time frames and consequences of default thereof including lapsing of acquisition proceedings cannot be read into the MRTP Act. Section 11-A of the Land Acquisition Act being one of such provisions cannot be applied to the acquisitions under Chapter VII of the MRTP Act.   [Para 80]\n\nPlanned development is quite different from merely 'achieving a public purpose' for which the land is acquired under the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act. Development plan, Regional Plan and town planning scheme are major events in the development of a State. They are controlled and guided by different financial, architectural and public interest for the development including macro and micro planning of the entire State. The provisions relating to planned development of the State or any part thereof, read in conjunction with the object of the Act, show that different time frames are required for initiation, finalization and complete execution of such development plans. The period of 10 years stated in Section 127 of the MRTP Act, therefore, cannot be said to be arbitrary or unreasonable ex facie. If the provisions of Section 11-A, with its serious consequence of lapsing of entire acquisition proceedings, are bodily lifted and read into the provisions of MRTP Act, it is bound to frustrate the entire scheme and render it ineffective and uncertain. Keeping in view the consequence of Section 11-A, every development plan could stand frustrated only for the reason that period of two years has lapsed and it will tantamount to putting an end to the entire development process. Another reason for rejecting the contention of the appellants is that for the full and complete implementation of the scheme de hors such reservation, allotment and designation, lands have to be acquired and once acquisition as argued, fails on the application of Section 11-A, those lands would have to be restored to the owners while lands of other plot owners under the same scheme would continue to be under reservation, allotment or designation. Even this would render the scheme unworkable. If the legislature has opted not to introduce any such limitation in the MRTP Act, then to read the same with reference to the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act would be unjust and render the scheme under the State Act completely unworkable. That certainly is not the legislative intent. Thus, reading of Section 11A of the Land Acquisition Act into Chapter VII of the MRTP Act will render the substantive provisions of the State Act ineffective, unworkable and may frustrate the object of the Act materially.   [Para 62]\n\nWhile holding that it is a case of legislation by incorporation, some of the amended provisions of the Central Act would be applicable to the State Act or read as a part thereof, with reference to the doctrine of pith and substance and harmonious application of the statutes.

In such situation Reference Court was not justified in deducting amount paid for trees under clause secondly of S.23(1) from market value of land paid under clause first S.23(1).  Moreover no evidence was led at all by respondent/Acquisition Officer for this.  Hence Reference Court was not justified in deducting value of trees from market value of land by relying upon AIR 1996 SC 106.  Said decision is only authority to proposition that when capitalization of income method is used compensation for land and fruit bearing trees cannot be determined separately.  Even in this decision Supreme Court held that in capitalization of income method trees would be valued only as fire wood and necessary compensation would be given.

In other words, the period of three years would automatically get extended by that much of period during which stay was in operation. But the interpretation of the word 'any' in Explanation 1 to the first proviso to Section 6 of the Act expands the scope of stay order granted in one case of land owners to be automatically extended to all those land owners, whose lands are covered under the notifications issued under Section 4 of the Act, irrespective of the fact whether there was any separate order of stay or not as regards their lands. As each of the notifications issued under S.4 in the instant case was composite in nature. Thus, in other words, the interim order of stay granted in one of the matters of the land owners would put complete restraint on the respondents to have proceeded further to issue notification under Section 6 of the Act. Had they issued the said notification during the period when the stay was operative, then obviously they may have been hauled up for committing contempt of court. The language employed in the interim orders of stay is also such that it had completely restrained the respondents from proceeding further in the matter by issuing declaration/notification under Section 6 of the Act.  [Para 76,87,91]\n\nConsequently, the Notifications under Section 4(1) of the Act being composite one it would not be proper and legally justifiable to quash the same more so when most of the appellants had not filed any objections under Section 5-A of the Act. Thus, the declarations issued under Section 6 of the Act cannot be quashed. In other words, it has been held that for all remaining lands for which neither the notifications under Section 4 nor declarations under Section 6 have been quashed, acquisition proceedings, notification/declaration issued for remaining lands would continue to hold good and respondents can proceed further.

                "description": "Award - Limitation - Exclusion of period of pending proceedings - After declaration under S.6 interim stay order for short period passed by Court and same was made final subsequently until further orders - Award passed therefrom within two years is within limitation.\n\nIn the instant case, a notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894 was issued on 24th of December, 1986 for acquisition of the said lands. A declaration under Section 6 of the Act was issued on 23rd of December, 1987. In the pending writ petitions, on 11th of February, 1988, the following interim order was passed :- \"Interim stay for four weeks. Notice returnable in four weeks.\" Subsequent to the passing of this interim order, it is true that the interim order was not extended by any further order of the Court. However, the parties thought that the interim order was continuing. Keeping that in mind, the State/respondents filed an application for vacating the interim order dated 11th of February, 1988 granted by the Court. On 3rd of July, 1991, on the said application for vacating the interim order filed at the instance of the State/respondents, the High Court passed the order which clearly shows that the order of stay granted initially for four weeks would continue pending further orders. From a perusal of the aforesaid interim order of the High Court passed on 3rd of July, 1991, it is, therefore, evident that there was an order of prohibition from dispossessing the appellants from the acquired lands pending further orders.   [Para 2,8,9,10]\n\nHeld that in the afore said circumstances award passed on 23-8-1993 was not beyond limitation prescribed under S.11-A of Land Acquisition Act. Both the parties proceeded on the basis that the interim order of stay had been continuing and the respondents were prohibited from dispossessing the appellants from the acquired lands pending further orders. That apart, it may be stated that although initially the interim order was passed for four weeks, the same interim order which was granted initially was made final until further orders on 3rd of July, 1991. From the above narration of facts, it must be held that no steps could be taken in view of the pending applications for grant of interim order and in view of the interim order granted pending further orders. Therefore, it cannot be said that the acquisition proceedings had lapsed due to expiry of two years from the date of publication of the declaration under Section 6 of the Act relating to the acquired lands. Thus, the award was passed in accordance with Section 11-A of the Act, that is to say, the award was passed within two years from the date of publication of declaration under Section 6 of the Act.   [Para 11,14]\n\nAlso, the State/respondent was entitled to exclude the period mentioned herein earlier and that it must also be held that if such period is excluded the period of two years from the date of declaration under Section 6 of the Act before the award is passed would not expire and accordingly, the question of holding that the entire acquisition proceeding shall lapse, cannot arise at all. Moreover, the appellants having taken advantage of an order passed by the High Court during the pendency of the writ petition which was sought to be vacated by the State/respondents by filing an application for vacating the stay order, it must be concluded that the award was passed within two years from the date of publication of the declaration under Section 6 of the Act and the respondents were entitled to exclude the period from 11th of February, 1988 to 3rd of July, 1991 and, therefore, if this period is excluded as enshrined in the explanation to Section 11-A of the Act, the award was within time and, therefore, the question of holding that the acquisition proceeding must lapse because of expiry of the said period, cannot arise at all.

The land has not been acquired for a Housing Colony or Government Office or an Institution. The land has been acquired for setting up a sugar factory. The factory would produce goods worth many crores in a year. A sugar factory apart from producing sugar also produces many by-product in the same process. One of the by-products is molasses, which is produced in huge quantity. Earlier, it had no utility and its disposal used to be a big problem. But now molasses is used for production of alcohol and ethanol which yield lot of revenue. Another by-product begasse is now used for generation of power and press mud is utilized in manure. Therefore, the profit from a sugar factory is substantial. Moreover, it is not confined to one year but will accrue every year so long as the factory runs. A Housing Board does not run on business lines. Once plots are carved out after acquisition of land and are sold to public, there is no scope for earning any money in future. An industry established on acquired land, if run efficiently, earns money or makes profit every year. The return from the land acquired for the purpose of Housing Colony, or Offices, or Institution cannot even remotely be compared with the land which has been acquired for the purpose of setting up a factory or industry. After all the factory cannot be set up without land and if such land is giving substantial return, there is no justification for making any deduction from the price exhibited by the exemplars even if they are of small plots. It is possible that a part of the acquired land might be used for construction of residential colony for the staff working in the factory. Nevertheless where the remaining part of the acquired land is contributing to production of goods yielding good profit, it would not be proper to make a deduction in the price of land shown by the exemplars of small plots as the reasons for doing so assigned in various decisions of this Court are not applicable in the case under consideration. Hence, having regard to the entire facts and circumstances of the case, a deduction of 10% from the market value of the land, which has been arrived at by the High Court would meet the ends of justice.

                "description": "Provision not retrospective in its operation - Award and decree passed by reference Court in year 1975 - Provision introduced during pendency of appeals filed against - No question of petitioners claiming any right of re-determination - Application under Section 28-A has to be made only on basis of award and decree of reference Court on a reference under Section 18, within limitation period of 3 months.\n\nAdmittedly, the reference Court passed its award and decree in the year 1975. Significantly, at that time Section 28-A was not in existence as the same was introduced in the year 1984 by the Amendment Act 68 of 1984. There is nothing, which suggests that the said provision is retrospective in its operation or that it applies to appeals pending at the time of coming into force of the said provision. It is only during the pendency of the appeals filed against the award of the reference Court that the said provision was introduced. Therefore, there was no question of the petitioners claiming any right of re-determination.  (1996)1 SCC 85, AIR 1997 SC 1793 - Rel. on.   [Para 10]\n\nThe conclusion is inevitable that the petitioners are not entitled to seek re-determination of compensation under Section 28-A of the Act, as they did not and could not have filed their applications within the period of three months from the date of the award of the reference Court. As their applications were beyond the time limit of three months from the date of the award of the reference Court, they are barred by limitation.   [Para 16]\n\nAssuming that the limitation for applying for re-determination will not start to run till the disposal of the appeals filed against the award of the reference Court, on the facts pleaded by the petitioners, they are barred by limitation. Even according to the petitioners, the appeals were disposed of by Court on 4.3.1986. They claim to have applied for certified copies of the judgment on 5.11.1988, obtained the same on 7.11.1988 and sent representations on 28.11.1988. The very fact that more than 2 1/2 years elapsed from the date of disposal of the appeals even by the time they applied for certified copies completely exposes the hollowness of the petitioners' claim that they filed their applications within the period of limitation, if date of disposal of the appeal is reckoned for the purpose of computing the period of three months prescribed in proviso to Section 28-A of the Act. In the said provision the time taken for the certified copy alone is required to be excluded while computing the period of 90 days. The petitioners cannot sleep over the matter without even applying for a certified copy for more than 2-1/2 years and still claim that they filed their applications within time. Apart from the fact that they could not file their applications within the prescribed time limit even after disposal of the appeals, the petitioners have gone in hibernation after they made their representations on 1.12.1988 and 16.9.1988 till the year 2004 when they approached the Lokayukta and they leisurely filed the present writ petition in the year 2005.  \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 17]\n\nThe law is well settled that High Court, which exercises discretionary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, does not come to the aid of those who sleep over their rights, if any, for unduly long periods.

A careful perusal of this provision which is an exception to the normal mode of acquisition contemplated under the Act shows mere existence of urgency or unforeseen emergency though is a condition precedent for invoking Section 17(4) that by itself is not sufficient to direct the dispensation of 5A inquiry. It requires an opinion to be formed by the concerned government that along with the existence of such urgency or unforeseen emergency there is also a need for dispensing with 5A inquiry which indicates that the Legislature intended that the appropriate government to apply its mind before dispensing with 5A inquiry. It also indicates the mere existence of an urgency under Section 17(1) or unforeseen emergency under Section 17(2) would not by themselves be sufficient for dispensing with 5A inquiry. If that was not the intention of the Legislature then the latter part of sub-section (4) of Section 17 would not have been necessary and the Legislature in Section 17(1) and (2) itself could have incorporated that in such situation of existence of urgency or unforeseen emergency automatically 5A inquiry will be dispensed with. But then that is not language of the Section which in our opinion requires the appropriate Government to further consider the need for dispensing with 5A inquiry in spite of the existence of unforeseen emergency. The requirement of an application of mind by the appropriate Government while dispensing with 5A inquiry does not mean that in and every case when there is an urgency contemplated under Section 17(1) and unforeseen emergency contemplated under Section 17(2) exists that by itself would not contain the need for dispensing with 5A inquiry. It is possible in a given case the urgency noticed by the appropriate Government under Section 17(1) or the unforeseen emergency under Section 17(2) itself may be of such degree that it could require the appropriate Government on that very basis to dispense with the inquiry under Section 5A but then there is a need for application of mind by the appropriate Government that such an urgency for dispensation of the 5A inquiry is inherent in the two types of urgencies contemplated under Section 17(1) and (2) of the Act. Sub-section (4) of Section 17 itself indicates that the \"government may direct that provisions of Section 5A shall not apply\" which makes it clear that not in every case where the appropriate Government has come to the conclusion that there is urgency and under sub-section (1) or unforeseen emergency under sub-section (2) of Section 17 the Government will ipso facto have to direct the dispensation of inquiry.\t\t\t\t\t [Para 31,32,33]\n\nThere should be an application of mind to the facts of the case with special reference to this concession of 5A inquiry under the Act. At this stage, it is relevant to notice that the limited right given to an owner/person interested under Section 5A of the Act to object to the acquisition proceedings is not an empty formality and is a substantive right, which can be taken away for good and valid reason and within the limitations prescribed under Section 17(4) of the Act. The right of representation and hearing contemplated under Section 5A of the Act is a very valuable right of a person whose property is sought to be acquired and he should have appropriate and reasonable opportunity of persuading the authorities concerned that the acquisition of the property belonging to that person should not be made. Therefore, if the appropriate Government decides to take away this minimal right then its decision to do so must be based on materials on record to support the same and bearing in mind the object of Section 5A. \t [Para 34,36]"

The powers given to a High Court under the Letters Patent are akin .to the constitutional powers of a High Court. Thus when a Letters Patent grants to the High Court a power of Appeal, against a judgment of a single Judge, the right to entertain the appeal would not get excluded unless the concerned statutory enactment excludes an appeal under the Letters Patent.\t\t\t\t\t [Para 9]\n\nA Letters Patent is not an enactment. It is the charter of the High Court. A non-obstante clause of this nature in S.54 cannot cover the charter of the High Court.  [Para 1]\n\nBy virtue of the Letters Patent \"an appeal\" against the judgment of a single Judge of the High Court would lie to a Division Bench. Section 54 of the said Act does not exclude an Appeal under the Letters Patent. The -word 'only' occurring immediately after the non-obstante clause in Section 54 refers to the forum of appeal. In other words it provides that the appeal will be to the High Court and not any other Court e.g. the District Court. The term \"an appeal\" does not restrict it to only one Appeal in the High Court. The term \"an appeal\" would take within its sweep even a Letters Patent Appeal. The decision of the Division Bench rendered in a Letters Patent Appeal will then be subject to appeal to the Supreme Court. Read in any other manner there would be a conflict between Section 54 and the provision of a Letters Patent. It is settled law that if there is a conflict, attempt should be made to harmoniously construe the provisions.\t [Para 14]"

                "description": "Determination of market value - Agricultural land with building potentiality - Report of Valuer - It must be based on conditions prevailing at time of S.4 Notification - Award declared on 26-10-1981 - Benefit of S.23 (1A) not available.\n\n\t The Valuer must indicate the prices available of the lands in the vicinity on the date of notification under S.4 of the Act, and not with reference to the date on which the Valuer visited the site. Notification was published in June 1978 and it was futile to refer to the condition prevailing in year 1986 for determination of market price of the acquired land. The same error was committed by the trial Judge who visited the site at the time of hearing of Reference in year 1986 and felt that the land was valuable.There is no evidence on record to indicate as to where these lands covered by Exhs. 17 to 21 are situated and what is the rate of development. The trial Court overlooked that the area under acquisition is 60.8 Ares and the land was used for the purpose of agriculture. The trial Judge was clearly in error in holding that the maximum price of Rs.25/- per sq.mtr. paid for small plot of 484 sq. mtrs. should be considered as the prevailing market price for determining the compensation of the acquired land. The trial Judge overlooked that the sale deed providing for the rate of Rs.25/- per sq. mtr. is of October 1977 while the latter two sale deeds of January 1979 and August 1979 indicate the price of Rs.19.76 and Rs.17.66 respectively, and, therefore, it was erroneous to assume that even the price of the developed plots was in the vicinity of Rs.25/- per sq. mtr. at the time of notification under S.4. It also cannot be overlooked that the prices of the agricultural lands with a building potentiality cannot be determined without taking into consideration the area which is required to be excluded for internal roads etc. at the time of developing property. The normal rule of excluding 1/3 rd area has to be applied in case there is no evidence as to what area would be required to be excluded from consideration while developing the land. The trial Judge  instead of excluding 1/3rd land, proceeded to deduct 1/3rd of the price of Rs.25/-. The trial Judge also overlooked that apart from spending considerable amount for developing the land and for advertising the plots for sale, the plots will not be sold over night and some deduction is required to be made by taking into consideration the time required for the disposal of the plots. The trial Judge without applying this well settled principle, arbitrarily felt that Rs.13/- per sq. mtr. should be adequate compensation. The claimants did not lead any evidence as to what is the demand for developed plots in this area and what time would be required for the disposal of the plots after developing the land. In these circumstances, the trial Judge was clearly in error in determining the compensation payable at the rate of Rs.13/- per sq. mtr.  [Para 4]\n\nThe counsel for the respondents (claimants) submitted that the compensation offered by the Land Acquisition Officer at the rate of Rs.3/- per sq. mtr. is inadequate even though the land is an agricultural land, because of the potentiality existing on the date of notification. There is considerable merit in this submission. The instances of sale deeds of agricultural lands on which reliance was placed, indicate that the rate prevalent in year 1968 was Rs.20,000/- per Hectare for agricultural land in village Bhisegaon. The prices of the agricultural land are also on increase and if 10% increase is granted per year, then the price of agricultural land in year 1978 would be Rs.40,000/- per Hectare. Though the evidence on record is not very clear, a judicial notice can be taken that the area around Karjat Railway Station and the Karjat Town has building potentiality. The land is situated hardly at a distance of 10 minutes walk from Karjat Railway Station. The time required for development of the land cannot be too distant. It would be proper to add Rs.10,000/- per Hectare while determining the compensation of the acquired land on the basis of building potentiality. The compensation payable, therefore, would be at the rate of Rs.50,000/- per Hectare and which comes to Rs.5/- per sq. mtr. This amount of compensation would adequately compensate the Respondents.  [Para 5]\n\nThe grievance of the Appellant that the trial Judge was in error in awarding compensation under S.23(1-A) of the Act deserves acceptance. The award in this case was declared on October 26, 1981 and, therefore, the benefit of S.23(1-A) is not available.\n\n1994(5) S.C.C.   593  Followed.  [Para 6]\n\nThe Respondents would be entitled to solatium at the rate of 30% on the additional compensation payable. The appeal preferred by the State Government is, therefore, required to be partly allowed and the following order is passed :-\n\nThe Respondents would be entitled to additional compensation of Rs.12,160/-, plus solatium at the rate of 30% of Rs.3,648/-, plus interest of Rs.19,139/- and thus the total amount payable is Rs.34,947/-.

The object seems to be to pay the compensation to the person interested to which in law he was entitled by way of an award under Section 11 of the said Act. The object is to pay compensation to him to which he was legitimately entitled to on the date of passing an award under Section 11 of the said Act. If Sub-sections (2) and (3) of Section 28A are read together, it appears that an Award under Sub-section (2) is on par with an Award under Section 11 of the said Act in so far as the provisions of reference under Section 18 of the said Act are concerned. Once an Award under Sub-section (2) of Section 28A is made, it replaces an Award under Section 11 for all purposes as it becomes an offer of the Appropriate Government.\n\nUnder sub-section 3 of section 28-A, a remedy is provided to a person who has not accepted the Award under sub-section 2 of section 28-A to apply for a reference to the Court. Once such application is made, for all purposes, it becomes an application under sub-section (1) of section 18 of the said Act and it will be governed by the provisions of sections 18 to 28 of the said Act. It is contended that sub-section 1 of section 28-A does not make a specific reference to the Award made on a reference under sub-section 3 of section 28-A. In fact, sub-section 1 of section 28-A provides that \"Where in an award under this Part, the Court allows to the applicant any amount of compensation in excess of the amount awarded by the Collector under Section 11\", a person aggrieved may apply for re-determination of compensation. Sub-section 1 applies when the Award of the Court allows the applicant any amount of compensation in excess of the amount awarded by the Collector by an Award under section 11 of the said Act. The Award made on a reference under sub-section 3 of section 28-A of the said Act will be an Award of the Court under part III which is specifically referred to in sub-section 1 of section 28-A of the said Act. Thus, when such Award of the Court allows an amount in excess of the amount provided in the Award under section 11, an application under sub-section 1 of section 28 will lie. Thus, an application will lie under said sub-section even on the basis of the Award made by the Court on a reference made in accordance with sub-section 3 of section 28-A of the said Act.

The evidence on record clearly showed that the land in question is low lying paddy field. The claimants have not brought on record any cogent and material evidence to establish that the land in question was of a suitable and potential nature for construction and industrial activity therein. The nature of the land in question is different from the lands referred to in the Awards passed earlier and the location and surroundings in case of land in question are different from those in case of lands in the Awards. The rate awarded in those Awards could not be accepted for fixation of market value of the land in question.  The rates in the earlier Awards in respect of lands in the vicinity of the land of subject matter is not to be accepted blindly without even comparing the land acquired subsequently with that of the one acquired earlier. Though the Awards passed in earlier acquisitions can be relevant for the purpose of comparing the rates awarded while fixing the rate for subsequent acquisition, this is possible only in cases of comparable lands in reasonable proximity of the acquired land and not otherwise.

The practice had shown that for the State officials it was a burden to trace out the persons connected with such transaction mentioned in the sale deeds and then to examine them in Court for the purpose of proving such transactions.  It was in the wake of the aforesaid practical difficulties that the new S.51A was introduced in the L.A. Act.  When the Section says the certified copy of a registered document \"may be accepted as evidence of the transaction recorded in such document\" it enables the Court to treat what is recorded in the document, in respect of the transactions referred to therein, as evidence. [Para 13]\n\nThe words \"may be accepted as evidence\" in the section indicate that there is no compulsion on the Court to accept such transaction as evidence, but it is open to the Court to treat them as evidence.  Merely accepting them as evidence does not mean that the Court is bound to treat them as reliable evidence.  What is sought to be achieved is that the transactions recorded in the documents may be treated as evidence, just like any other evidence, and it is for the Court to weigh all the pros and cons to decide whether such transaction can be relied on for understanding the real price of the land concerned. [Para 14]\n\nIn the case of S.51A of the LA Act also the position cannot be different, as it is open to the Court to act on the documents regarding the transaction recorded in such documents.  However, this will not prevent any party who supports or opposes the said document or the transaction recorded therein to adduce other evidence to substantiate their stand regarding such transactions.  But it is not possible to hold that even after the introduction of S.51A the position would remain the same as before (1993) 3 SCC 240 and (1995) 2 SCC 205 overruled.\t\t\t\t [Para 16]"

There is nothing in sub-sec. (1) of S.28-A to indicate that this right is confined in respect of the earliest award that is made by the Court after the coming into force of S.28-A.\" Any construction to the contra introducing such words, not found engrafted in the very provision would amount to curtailing the amplitude of the provision resulting virtually in restricting a benefit conferred, particularly of a beneficent provision normally not permissible by judicial interpretation. It was also held therein that there is nothing in the wordings of S.28-A to indicate that the legislature intended to confer any such limited benefit thereunder which would have the inevitable consequence of denying the benefit of higher amount on the basis of the subsequent award. Such an interpretation as would restrict the benefit of S.28-A to the first of the Award in the series and in point of time, was also considered to result more in the perpetuation of the inequality in the payment of compensation, which the legislature specifically intended to remove by enacting the provision and that, therefore, the object underlying S.28-A would be better served and achieved by giving the word \"an award\" in S.28-A its natural meaning, as meaning any one of the award(s) made by the Court under Part-III, after the coming into force of S.28-A. That apart, even the latter part of S.28-A which stipulates, \"require that the amount of compensation payable to them may be re-determined on the basis of the amount of compensation awarded by the Court,\" leaves the choice to the person making such an application for redetermination, without confining or restricting the area of choice of such person to any one or the other, though it could be availed of only once and not as many number of times as there are so many awards.\n\n(1995) 2 SCC 736 Followed.\t  [Para 4]"

Comparable Sales Method of valuation is preferred because it famishes the evidence for determination of the market value of the acquired land at which a willing purchaser would pay for the acquired land if it has been sold in open market at the time of issue of notification under Section 4 of the Act.   However, Comparable Sales Method of valuation of land for fixing the market value of the acquired land is not always conclusive. There are certain factors which are required to be fulfilled and on fulfillment of those factors the compensation can be awarded, according to the value of the land reflected in the  sales.  The factors laid down inter alia are : (1) the sale must be a genuine transaction, that (2) the sale deed must have been executed at the time proximate to the date of issue of notification under Section 4 of the Act, that (3) the land covered by the sale must be in the vicinity of the acquired land, that (4) the land covered by the sales must be similar to the acquired land and that (5) the size of plot of the land covered by the sales be comparable to the land acquired. If all these factors are satisfied, then there is no reason why the sale value of the land covered by the sales be not given for the acquired land.   However, if there is a dissimilarity in regard to locality, shape, site or nature of land between land covered by sales and land acquired, it is open to Court to proportionately reduce the compensation for acquired land than what is reflected in the sales depending upon the disadvantages attached with the  acquired land.\t\t [Para 3]"

The Reference Court did not painstake to elucidate as to how the compensation awarded by SLAO was just, proper and reasonable. In such circumstances, the impugned judgment and award would not be construed as adjudication of dispute within ambit of law. It cannot be treated as an award under S. 26 of the Act of 1894. Albeit, the Court has no jurisdiction to refuse for determination of the amount of compensation even where the claimant remains absent or where he is present, but fails to adduce evidence. It is mandatory for the Civil Court to apply its judicious mind and make an award under S. 26 of the Act of 1894.\t\t [Para 12,13,14,16]"

So far as Section 5A is concerned, the notice is required to be issued to the objector, as, it is strictly meant for the objectors who raise the same.  However this does not mean that persons who have not raised the objection shall not be called at all by the Officer concerned for making the necessary enquiry.  The intention of issuance of preliminary notification i.e. notification u/s 4(1) itself is to give a chance to all those interested in whatsoever manner they may be in the land to raise an objection.  In our opinion, therefore, it is not contemplated in sub-section (2) of section 5A that if anybody's name comes to the notice of the Officer concerned through the objection raised by the objector, he should go on issuing notices to all such persons at all such stages and particularly when such person though had an enough opportunity but failed to have raised the objection on the basis of the notification issued u/s 4 of the Act.  [Para 15]\n\nThe Collector or the Land Acquisition Officer could not expand the scope of his inquiry by calling everyone to whom a reference is made by the objectors and particularly when such persons had an opportunity to raise objection on the basis of notification under Section 4(1) of the Act. [Para 26]\n\nSection 9 definitely contemplates a notice to be given to the interested persons as it is made incumbent on the Collector to affix public notice at a convenient place or near the land to be taken indicating the intention of the Government to take possession of the said land and call upon all the persons interested in such land to make claims as to the compensation.  Sub-section (2) of Section 9 calls upon all the persons interested in land to appear in person or through agent before the Collector at the time and place mentioned in the notice and to state the nature of their respective interests in the land, the amount and the shares in the compensation amount.  Sub-section (3) of Section 9 of the Act makes it incumbent on the Collector concerned to serve a notice to the same effect on the occupier, if any, of such land and all such persons known or believed to be interested therein or to be entitled to act for the persons so interested or for agents authorised to receive service on their behalf within the local district in which the land is situated.  In pursuance of sub-section (4) of Section 9 of the Act, in appropriate cases as are mentioned therein the Collector has to send notices by post to the interested persons.  This is for the first time that the Act requires a notice to be issued to the party concerned or persons interested in the land.  Neither Section 4 nor Section 6 contemplate any personal notice either to the owners or the persons interested in the land to be acquired.\n\n1975 Mah.LJ 1035 and 1981 Mah.LJ 511 Rel. on.\t\t\t [Para 18,19]"

                "description": "Compensation - Acquisition of land - 84 acres of land acquired - Land having commercial and residenticial potential but entirely undeveloped - One side abutted main road but remaining large area where planned development was required needing internal roads, drainage, sewer, water, electricity lines, and other civic amenities - Cut of 20% on rate of compensation as against 1/3 normal deduction was proper taking into consideration potential for development - Price fetched by small plot cannot be accepted so also the argument that the land was adjacent to development area.\n\nThe land proposed to be the acquired was a large area of 84 acres. In order to develop this land, roads were to be laid, provisions for drainage was to be made and certain area was to be earmarked for other civic amenities. Thus, after leaving the area in the land required for the purposes mentioned above, plots were to be made for residential and commercial purposes by incurring expenditure for other developmental works, such as providing electricity, water, etc. The acquired land is not small plot located in such a way that no other development was required at all and it could be utilized as it is as a developed building site. It is well-settled that in respect of agricultural land or undeveloped land which has potential value for housing or commercial purposes, normally 1/3 amount of compensation has to be deducted out of the amount of compensation payable on the acquired land subject to certain variations depending on its nature, location, extent of expenditure involved for development and the area required for roads and other civic amenities to develop the land so as to make the plots for the residential or commercial purposes. A land may be plain or uneven, the soil of the land may be soft or hard bearing on the foundation for the purpose of making construction; may be the land is situated in the midst of a developed area all around but that land may have a hillock or may be low-lying or may be having deep ditches. So the amount of expenses that may be incurred in developing the area also varies. A claimant who claims that his land is fully developed and nothing more is required to be done for developmental purposes, must show on the basis of evidence that it is such a land and it is so located. In the absence of such evidence, merely saying that area adjoining his land is developed area, is not enough particularly when the extent of the acquired land is large and even if a small portion of the land is abutting the main road in the developed area, does not give the land character of a developed area. In 84 acres of land acquired even if one portion on one side abuts the main road, the remaining large area where planned development is required, needs laying of internal roads, drainage, sewer, water, electricity lines, providing civic amenities etc. However, in cases of some land where there are certain advantages by virtue of the developed area around, may help in reducing the percentage of cut to be applied, as the developmental charges required may be less on that account. There may be various factual factors which may have to be taken into consideration while applying the cut in payment of compensation towards developmental charges, may be in some cases it is more than 1/3 and in some cases less than 1/3. It must be remembered that there is difference between a developed area and an area having potential value, which is yet to be developed. The fact that an area is developed or adjacent to a developed area will not ipso facto make every land situated in the area also developed to be valued as a building site or plot, particularly when vast tracts are acquired, as in this case, for development purposes.\t\t [Para 7]"

(1908), O.1, R.10 & O.22, Rr.3,4.\n\nAn application for reference may be made by any person interested who has not accepted the award.  An application for reference, therefore, could be made by the legal representatives of the land owner.   Sub-section (2) of Section 18 provides for the limitation within which it has to be made.  Factually, in the present case such application was made by the land owner himself.  An application for substitution of the legal representatives of Janglu, who was the original owner' after his death was made before the Land Acquisition Officer.  It was, therefore, necessary for the Land Acquisition Officer to decide that application and then proceed to forward the reference to the appropriate Court mentioned in Section 18.  Section 19 enjoins upon the Collector the duty to state certain information in the reference and it requires that he shall state the names of persons whom he has reasons to think are interested in such land.  It is, therefore, a statutory duty of the Special Land Acquisition Officer to inform the names of the persons whom he has reasons to believe are interested in the land.  Consequently, when an application for substitution of the applicants as legal representatives of deceased Janglu was pending before him, it was his duty under Section 19 to decide that application and inform their names to the Court as contemplated by Section 19.  Failure on the part of the Collector to do his duty cannot result in depriving the applicants of their right to claim enhanced compensation under Section 18 of the Act.\t\t [Para 9]\n\nIt will be seen from the provisions of O.1, R.10 that the Court may even suo motu add parties in the interest of justice.  It is, therefore, a power of the Court to add parties to a suit either at the instance of the party already appearing before the Court or suo motu.  This power of the Court is entirely different than the power vested in the Court under Order 22 which deals with death, marriage and insolvency of parties.  Rule 1 provides that the death of the plaintiff and defendant shall not cause the suit to abate if the right to sue survives.  In this case, right to sue survives on the death of the original landholder.  Rules 3 & 4 of Order 22 then provide for making of an application for substitution by the legal representatives of the party dying as the right to sue or be sued survives under Rule 1.   Thus, it is a statutory right of the legal representatives of a party dying during the pendency of a lis that is conferred by the provisions of Order 22.  It is entirely different statutory right than the right conferred on the Court by Order 1 Rule 10 C.P.C.  These two are distinct powers and proceedings are required to be taken for exercise of that power.\t [Para 10]"

It is also provided that in computing the period of three months, the day on which the award was pronounced and the time requisite for obtaining the copy of the award is to be excluded. Therefore, the aforesaid provision crystallizes that application under S.28-A is to be filed within three months from the date of the award by the Court by only excluding the time requisite for obtaining copy. Hence, it is difficult to infer further exclusion of time on the ground of acquisition of knowledge by the applicant.  \t [Para 7]\n\nThough Section 28-A is a beneficial provision, the advantage of the benefit which is conferred is required to be taken within the stipulated time. A landowner may be poor or illiterate and because of that he might not have filed reference application but that would not mean that he could be negligent in not finding out whether other landowners have filed such applications. Whosoever wants to take advantage of the beneficial legislation has to be vigilant and has to take appropriate action within prescribed time. He must at least be vigilant in making efforts to find out whether other landowner has filed any reference application and if so what is the result. If that is not done then law cannot help him. Admittedly, in the present case, award enhancing the compensation was pronounced by the Civil Court by order dated 29th November, 1984 and applications were filed on 27th November, 1989 i.e. after lapse of 5 years. In such case, as the applicant was having an opportunity of knowing the award and/or he was required to make efforts of knowing about such proceedings, he must be presumed to have had knowledge of the award. If such delayed applications are entertained, there may not be any finality to the award and payment of compensation. Result may be that such proceedings may adversely affect where land is acquired by the Government for a project which is to be carried out by local bodies. [Para 10]\n\nThe award passed by the Court cannot be termed as an offer for market price for purchase of the land. There is no duty cast upon the Court to issue notice to the landowners who have not initiated proceedings for enhancement of compensation by filing reference applications; may be that their lands are acquired by a common notification issued under S.4 of the Act. As against this, under S.18 it is the duty of the Collector to issue notice either under S.12(2) of the Act at the time of passing of the award or in any case the date to be pronounced before passing of the award and if this is not done then the period prescribed for filing application under S.18 is six months from the date of the Collector's award.

This provision is a mandatory provision.  Once requirement of law clearly mandates the authorities to perform any particular act within the specified period and further provides for consequences in case of failure to comply with such mandate, any failure on the part of the authorities to ensure due compliance of the mandate of such provision is bound to result the act done in contravention of such provision to be ab initio void.  When a duty is cast on the public body to perform an act within the specified period, such duty has to be performed within the specified period and such provision is to be construed as mandatory, and more so when the consequences for failure to comply such duty are also provided under the provision of law.  (2003)10 SCC 1 Rel. on.  [Para 11]\n\nUndoubtedly, the general rule that the non-compliance of mandatory requirements results in nullification of the act is subject to one exception and the exception is that the requirement or conditions of that mandate may be waived by the person for whose interest the condition or requirement is provided for. It is primarily the duty of the Land Acquisition Officer to ensure strict compliance of the period of two years for the purpose of making of award under Section 11 from the date of last declaration of notification under Section 6.  Undoubtedly, such obligation is cast upon the Land Acquisition Officer from the point of view of protecting the interest of the parties whose land is sought to be acquired.  Being so, though it could be argued that the persons for whose benefit the mandatory limit of two years is prescribed under Section 11-A would be entitled to waive such requirement or condition prescribed under Section 11-A, it is difficult to accept the contention on behalf of the Government that the reference under Section 18 itself would amount to such a waiver.  [Para 12,13]\n\nThe scope of the reference being limited, to the four grounds specified in Section 18, and upon mere invocation of right to challenge the award on those four grounds, certainly, it cannot be said that a party seeking to exercise it's right under Section 18 would waive his rights under Section 11-A.  It is well settled law that waiver has to be clear and specific.  It cannot be by mere implication.  Besides, there is no estoppel against law.  Considering all these aspects, the contention that, reference under Section 18 would amount to waiver of right under Section 11-A, cannot be accepted.  [Para 14]"

Admittedly, the word \"protest\" has not been defined in the said Act. Undisputedly, the statutory provisions do not prescribe any specific mode of lodging the protest at the time of collecting the compensation awarded by the Land Acquisition Officer. Therefore, it cannot be said that the protest contemplated under the said proviso is necessarily by way of specific recording in writing about the protest in the receipt issued by the interested person while accepting the compensation. Considering the phraseology of Section 18 and 28-A of the said Act, a wider meaning will have to be given to the word \"protest\" to be found in the second proviso to sub-section (2) of Section 31.  Being so, the protest will have to be understood to be an act on the part of the interested person which will disclose his dissatisfaction about the compensation awarded by the Land Acquisition Officer.  It can be lodged in different forms either by specifically recording such protest at the time of acceptance of money or even by lodging an application for enhancement of compensation under Section 18 or even orally intimating the authorities that he is not satisfied with the compensation awarded at the time of disbursement of the amount by the Collector under Section 31(1) of the said Act.  In case of such an oral intimation, it will be the duty of the compensation disbursing officer to note such protest in the records relating to the payment of compensation for the land acquired.  Bearing in mind the number of illiterate people in the country and taking judicial notice of the bureaucratic red-tapism and carelessness prevailing almost in every public office, the principle that ignorance of law is no excuse should not be allowed to be stretched to such an extent that it can be a tool in the hands of the authorities to deny the statutory right in relation to the compensation to the owners whose properties are acquired. Otherwise, it may result in encouraging the acts to defeat the very purpose of Article 300-A of the Constitution of India. The provisions of the Act cannot be read and understood by ignoring the mandate of Article 300-A of the Constitution of India.  Viewed from this angle, therefore, merely because in the records of the Government there does not find any endorsement by the interested parties that they had received the amount of compensation under protest, it cannot be presumed that the interested parties were satisfied or were not aggrieved by the compensation awarded by the Land Acquisition Officer even though they had filed their application expressing desire for enhancement of the compensation, and it could have been concluded by the Collector that the Collector was entitled to reject the application under Section 18. 1986 Mh.L.J.181 and 2002(1) ALL MR 27 - Referred to.

One of the things which is required to be agreed by the parties is the compensation to be paid for the acquired land.  If the compensation is agreed upon by the parties, it is not necessary for the Collector to hold an enquiry as to what would be the market value of the land on the date of issuance of notification, but the Collector would be entitled to award compensation in accordance with the agreement between the parties.  Consequently, there would be no necessity of making a reference to the District Court under S.18 for determination of the compensation for the acquired lands where the award is passed on the basis of an agreement passed under sub-section (2) of section 11 of the Act.  When a person enters into an agreement under section 11(2), the award cannot be regarded as an offer which may or may not be accepted by the person whose land is acquired because he has entered into an agreement regarding the amount of compensation.  The Collector would therefore be right in declining to make a reference under S.18 of the Act where the award is based upon an agreement made under S.11(2) of the Act.  [Para 7]"

The four memorials that exist are in the name of Dr. Kotnis created by someone else.

Section 5-A is only a safeguard against the arbitrary exercise of the power by the State.  But one should also not lose sight of the fact that invocation of such a provision is also sometimes imperative as in order to meet the urgency of the situation it needs to be invoked in public interest.  It depends upon case to case.  Sometimes it may not be necessary at all and the State functionaries may sometimes out of over zealousness may invoke this provision which would seriously jeopardize the interest of the people.  Therefore, it depends upon case to case whether in a given situation Section 5-A has been correctly invoked and the authorities were satisfied in an objective manner.  In the present case, there are no two opinions that because of the globalization of economy Indian economy is progressing with fast speed, therefore in order to keep pace with the speed, invocation of Section 5-A has become imperative.  Traffic congestion is a common experience of one and all and it is very difficult to negotiate with the traffic congestion in Delhi and National Capital region.  Therefore, in the present situation, it cannot be said that the invocation of Section 5-A was for ulterior purpose or was arbitrary exercise of the power.  Since the Master Plan has already been prepared and it has been approved by the Planning Board and they have sanctioned a sum of Rs.20.65 crores for the development of this Transport Nagar and widening of the National Highway No.91 into four lanes.  Therefore, the proposal was approved by the Board and it got the sanction from the National Capital Region Planning Board and ultimately the Government invoked the power under Section 17(4) read with Section 5-A of the Act dispensing with the objections.  In the light of these facts it cannot be said that invoking of power was in any way improper exercise.  There is need for decongestion of the traffic and it is really the dire need of the hour and earliest it is implemented, better for the people at large.

However, when the objectors are filed beyond the period of limitation prescribed under the statute, there is no obligation upon the authorities to grant personal hearing to such objections.  As regards the second contention that even though the objections were filed beyond the period of limitation, it was necessary for the authorities to consider the same before submitting the report, even without giving personal hearing to the parties, it is to be seen that in such cases it would be entirely in the discretion of the concerned authorities to consider such objections.  Only in a case when the objections are relevant to decide the issue as to whether the acquisition is for the public purpose or not, certainly the authorities would be empowered to consider such objections in their discretion but not as an obligation. Assuming that there is any lapse on the part of the authorities in considering such objections, that cannot create any right in favour of the party, whose objections filed beyond the period of limitation are not considered, to seek a writ of mandamus directing the authorities to consider his objection.  In other to seek such a direction, the party seeking such a relief must have right in his favour and there must be failure on the part of the authorities in performance of their obligation.

The State can dispose of the property thereafter or convey it to anyone, if the land is not needed for the purpose for which it was acquired, only for the market value that may be fetched for the property as on the date of conveyance.  The doctrine of public trust would disable the State from giving back the property for anything less than the market value.   [Para 11]\n\nIf the request of the writ petitioners for re-conveyance in terms of Section 48-B of the Act stood rejected as apparently conceded by them before learned single judge, one finds it difficult to see how a second direction can be issued even in the absence of a challenge in the writ petition to the order of rejection and without examining the reasons contained therein.  That order was also binding on the writ petitioners, so long as it was not got rid of.  The order rejecting the request had become final and in a sense, it was not open to the learned single judge to issue the direction to consider an identical representation all over again.  The Division Bench went one step further, we regret to say, without a proper consideration of the relevant aspects.  The Division Bench apparently, even without giving the Tamil Nadu Housing Board an opportunity of being heard, proceeded at the stage of admission itself to direct re-conveyance of the lands to the writ petitioners. If the Division Bench felt that there was a case to be looked into, it should have admitted the writ appeal, issued rule nisi to the parties and thereafter heard the matter and disposed it of in the light of the relevant provisions of the Act, the law bearing on the subject and the facts obtaining.  Even when the Division Bench got an opportunity to correct itself on being approached by way of review, it did not utilise that opportunity.  In the Writ Petition, there were no sufficient allegations justifying interference by the Court.  Mere claim of possession by the writ petitioners is not a foundation on which the relief now granted could have been rested either by the learned single judge or by the Division Bench of the High Court.  On the materials, no right to relief had been established by the writ petitioners.\t   [Para 8,10]"

The scheme of the Act is clear which provides for issuance of preliminary notification under sub-section (1) of Section 4 of the Act empowering the appropriate Government to issue such notification for acquisition of land needed or likely to be needed for any public purpose. Since the property belongs to a private individual, unless there is a 'public purpose' as defined in clause (f) of Section 3 of the Act, no acquisition of land can be made. It is in exercise of power of eminent domain that a sovereign may acquire property which does not belong to him. In the circumstances, as a general rule, before exercise of power of eminent domain, law must provide an opportunity of hearing against the proposed acquisition.   [Para 26,27]\n\nFurther, even in cases falling under or covered by sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section 17 of the Act and the Government intends to acquire land in cases of 'urgency' or 'unforeseen emergency', it is still required to follow procedure under Section 5-A of the Act before issuance of final notification under Section 6 of the Act. It is only when the Government also makes a declaration under sub-section (4) of Section 17 that it becomes unnecessary to take recourse to procedure under Section 5-A of the Act. Thus, though acquisition of land for housing accommodation or for construction of residential quarters for dalits and tribals can be said to be of an urgent nature falling under Section 17(1) of the Act. But even in such cases, procedure required to be followed under Section 5-A cannot be dispensed with unless notification under sub-section (4) of Section 17 is issued. Also, the provision cannot be pressed in service by officers who were negligent and due to their lethargy, proceedings could not be initiated for a quite long time.  2004(5) ALL MR (S.C.) 1170 and (1964)3 SCR 425 - Expl. and Applied.

It is a matter of record that the notification under Section 4(1) of the Act was issued on 18-4-1980 and it was followed by a declaration under Section 6 of the Act on 16-5-1980. The petitioner passed an award, dated 15-5-1985. Not being satisfied with the market value fixed by the petitioner, the respondents sought for reference. The petitioner acceded to the same and referred the matter to the Trial Court. The parameters of adjudication by a Civil Court in a reference under Section 18 of the Act are very limited. The reference can be only for determination of the objections as to the measurement of land, the amount of compensation payable for it, or the apportionment of compensation among the various persons, interested in the land. Beyond that, the Civil Court cannot address itself to the question of the very validity of notification. The reason is that the award came to be passed after the stage of notifications and with the active participation of the owners of the land.  In a way, it can be said that even where the notifications under Section 4(1) of the Act and Section 6 are defective, the landowners are deemed to have waived their objections by participating in the award enquiry. Therefore, even where an objection is raised touching on the legality and validity of the notifications, while participating in reference under Section 18 of the Act, the Court cannot deal with the same. Such matters are clearly outside the scope of reference.\t\t\t       [Para 5]"

So far as the irrigation is concerned, it may be seasonal or perennial source of water to the land concerned.  Apart from these two categories/classes of lands, potkharaba land/non-cultivable land can be considered by the Special Land Acquisition Officer while determining the market value of the land concerned.  For classification, the quality, fertility with other factors of jirayat land can be considered.  However, it does not stand to reason as to how the assessment of land can be made a basis for grouping of the agricultural lands.  Here one more aspect requires consideration.  Use of the mannure, chemical or otherwise, is the order of the day.  Such use of the mannure undoubtedly improves the fertility of the agricultural land.  Therefore, grouping of lands made by the Special Land Acquisition Officer on the basis of assessment and accepted by the Reference Court is not legal, proper and in accordance with the provisions of law.

The said provision seeks to confer the benefit of enhanced compensation even on those owners who did not seek a reference under Section 18. It cannot be that those who secure a certain benefit by reason of others getting such benefit should retain that benefit, even though the others on the basis of whose claim compensation was enhanced are deprived of the enhanced compensation to an extent. This would be rather inequitable and unfair. Moreover, even if it be that the compensation payable to claimants who have applied under Section 28-A of the Act, is the enhanced compensation decreed by the Reference Court, we must understand the decree to mean the decree of the Reference Court as modified in appeal by higher Courts. Otherwise, an incongruous position may emerge that a person who did not challenge the award of the Collector and did not claim a reference under Section 18 of the Act would get a higher compensation than one who challenged the award of the Collector and claimed a reference, but in whose case a higher compensation determined by the Reference Court was subsequently reduced by superior court.\t\t\t\t\t\t      [Para 7]"

However, it appears that the learned Reference Court did not consider smallness of the plot of sale deed as one of the minus factors as compared to the acquired property which was more than seven times larger than the plot of sale deed.  Likewise, the learned Reference Court also appears not to have considered that acquired property was having a gradient and was otherwise slopy but proceeded to adjust this minus factor against the said deduction of 1/3.  When the market value is to be determined on the basis of small plots of land the same price cannot be expected to be realised when a larger track of land is offered to a willing purchaser by a willing vendor.  In case more plots like the one in question were to be carved out by the appellants, the appellants would have certainly to wait for some time to sell the same to willing purchasers and on that count also a further deduction ought to have been made by the Reference Court.  Therefore, in addition to 1/3 deduction made further deductions ought to have been made for the minus points referred to hereinabove and considering the totality of the facts of the case, the learned Reference Court ought to have made a total deduction of at least 40% and having made the same, market value ought to have been fixed for the acquired property at Rs.120/- per sq.m. which is hereby done.  2003(10) SCC 525, (1996)7 SCC 3 - Referred to.\t [Para 10]"

The award that has been passed by the court in excess of the amount awarded by the collector under S.11 is the basis on which the interested person  moves the application under S.28-A and seeks re-determination.  It is not necessary for claiming re-determination under S.28-A that the land in case of a person claiming re-determination of compensation awarded under S.11 is exactly identical to the land for which the award has been passed by the court. A close similarity and proximity to the award passed by the court is sufficient to entitle a person interested in the land covered by the same notification under S.4(1) to which the said award relates, to apply for re-determination, S.28-A postulates re-determination of the amount of compensation on the basis of the award of the court made in favour of another. But that does not mean that factually and actually the land must be exactly similar.\n\nTherefore, where the land of the expropriated owner was similarly situated to that of another person's land which came to be acquired under the same proceedings and only the trees standing thereon were somewhat different, it was held that merely because the trees standing thereon were somewhat different, that would not mean that the land was dis-similar, incapable for re-determination under S.28-A of the Land Acquisition Act.

Not having done so, the interest payable to the petitioners, one year after the amount of compensation was expected to be deposited, would be payable @ 15% p.a.. Although the Award has been modified and the Reference Court has granted an enhancement of the amount, in any event, the petitioners would be entitled to interest @ 15% p.a., one year after the Award under Section 11 of the said Act was made, on account of the failure to deposit the compensation payable to the petitioners.

                "description": "Acquisition of land - Determination of market value - Sale deed of undivided rights - Such undivided rights which are appurtaining to the flat premises cannot be a basis for determining the market value of open land - Also, a forest area cannot be compared to the land which was converted for non-agricultural purpose as such area has its own peculiar advantages.\n\nDealing with the sale instances produced by the Applicants, Court held that the Sale Deed of an undivided right cannot be a basis for the purpose of determining the market value of land as on the date of Section 4 Notification, as such undivided right has been sold in view of the existence of a constructed premises in a residential building. The price fixed therein, cannot be a price offered by a willing purchaser in the open market. Such undivided rights, which are appurtaining to the flat premises cannot be a basis for determining the market value of open land. Apart from that, the land which was subject matter of the said Sale Deed which is dated 11th November, 1996, is at a distance of about 1.5 kilometres from the Mapusa market and about 1 kilometre from the Highway. The said Sale Deed as such cannot be a comparable sale instance. The Sale Deeds produced with regard to the plots located at Xelpem are at a distance of 5 kilometres from the acquired land and, as such, the same cannot be compared to the land acquired. It is also admitted that the said land is a forest area and there is no dispute that the land acquired in the present proceedings was not a forest area. A forest area cannot be compared to the land which was converted for non agricultural purpose as such area has its own peculiar advantages.\n\nThe Sale Deed produced by the Applicants in respect of the properties located in Mapusa City and which are at a distance of nearly 3 kilometres from the acquired land are also not comparable Sale instances. In the heart of a city the prices can differ considering its respective location. In cities, when the properties are located close to the market, they fetch a higher commercial value considering that such land can be used for business activity. As land located in the outskirts of the city cannot be compared to lands located in the heart of the city unless material is produced to value the demerits and merits of such land. The commercial value of such lands will be much less than the value of Sale Deeds located in the heart of City. No evidence has been adduced by the Applicants to establish such differentiation in the land value between such two locations. On that count, the Sale Deed produced by the Applicants of land sold to Kamat Construction, cannot be considered to be a comparable Sale Deed for considering the basis for determining the market value of land. As such, the said sale instance at exhibit 31, cannot be considered for the purpose of determining the market value of land. The sale instances produced by the Respondents are stated to be more than 2 kilometres from the acquired land besides that the same are not adjoining the Highway nor has evidence been recorded to establish that such land could be used for non agricultural purpose or are in the vicinity of the acquired land. In view of the above, the only sale instance which remains for consideration is the award of the Land acquisition Officer which took place in the year 1980 in respect of the portion of the same property belonging to the Applicants for the purpose of National Highway 17. The said land admittedly is part of the same survey number, which is the subject matter in the present proceedings. When no comparable sale instance is available for determining the market value of land, there is no bar to rely on such award to determine the market value of land as on the date of Section 4 notification after giving appropriate escalation on account of appreciation considering the surrounding circumstances. The previous acquisition took place in the year 1980 and the price was fixed at Rs. 40/- per square metre. The notification in the present case was issued in 21st August, 1997.  2008(17) SCC 133 and 2009(5) ALL MR 1022 (S.C.) - Ref. to.\t  [Para 14,15]"

In view of this it has to be said that the trial Court has committed an error in rejecting the claim of the appellant for enhancement of compensation merely on technical ground that the appellant has not recorded his protest while receiving the amount of compensation.  The protest required to be recorded by the claimant while receiving the amount of compensation need not be expressed in writing.  That apart, the Land Acquisition Officer, who has paid the amount of compensation, accepts and refers the petition filed by the claimant to the Court for deciding enhancement of compensation, as claimed by the claimant, does imply that the claimant has received the amount of compensation under protest.  If that is so, then it was not within the powers of the Civil Court to reject the application or reference on technical ground that the claimant has not expressed or recorded his protest while receiving the amount.  That is much more so as in the instant case the Civil Court, considering the merits of the matter, has recorded a finding that the enhanced amount of compensation of Rs.1,00,000/- as claimed by the appellant was reasonable and that he is entitled for the same.  Not only that, but the Court has recorded a finding that the compensation fixed in the Award was inadequate.  In the circumstances the claimant is entitled to enhanced amount of compensation.

Failure of the parties to arrive at an agreement as to the amount of compensation payable to the expropriated owners of the land in question led the owners to seek appointment of an Arbitrator for determination of the amount payable to them.

The court should not award more unless it is possible to reach a different conclusion. Even the appellate court should not interfere in such a fact situation unless the judgment is based on wrong application of principle or because some important point affecting valuation has been overlooked or misapplied. The consideration paid by the owner only a few months ago presents bonafide evidence of value subject to certain exceptions such as relationship of the parties, market conditions and terms of sale and the date of sale. In case a purchaser has not shown the exact amount of consideration paid by him in the sale deed to save the stamp duty such dishonest vendee is not required to be protected by the court. A cumulative increase of 10 to 15 per cent per year in the market value of the land may be accepted unless the State agencies or acquiring authority prove otherwise.\n\n2008 ALL SCR 1228, 2008(6) ALL MR 491 (S.C.), (2008) 17 SCC 133, 2009 ALL SCR 2400 Rel. on.

The claimant who does not accept the award can seek a reference under section 18 of the said Act. After reference under section 18 of the said Act is made, the claimant is in a position of the plaintiff who has to discharge the initial burden of proving that the market value offered by the Special Land Acquisition Officer is inadequate. After the said burden is discharged, for establishing the correct market value on the relevant date, the claimant is duty bound to adduce evidence. The well accepted method which is normally adopted in such matters is comparison method by producing and proving the comparable sale instances or Awards made under sections 11 or 18 of the said Act in respect of comparable lands. In the present case, it is an admitted position that the claimants have not relied upon any comparable sale instances or any awards in land acquisition cases. The claimants have stepped into witness box and have deposed regarding the area of the acquired land and the claim made by them. The perusal of the Roznama of the proceedings shows that no document of sale instance has been exhibited. Thus, in short, the claimants have not adduced any evidence in the form of comparable sale instances. There is no evidence adduced to show that the market value offered under the Award made by the Special Land Acquisition Officer is inadequate. The impugned awards under section 18 of the said Act are based only on the draft award prepared by the Special Land Acquisition Officer. In the draft award prepared by the Special Land Acquisition Officer, there is an observation made that the market value of Rs.85/- per sq. meter is quite fair and reasonable. There is a similar statement found in the award published under section 11 of the said Act. However, the said observation is to the effect that he had made valuation at the rate of Rs.85/- per sq. meter. Under the proviso to sub section 1 of section 11, the Collector/Special Land Acquisition Officer cannot make an award without prior approval of the officer appointed by appropriate Government. \t [Para 4,5]"

A guess work, though allowed, is permissible only to a limited extent. The market value of the land is to be determined taking into consideration the existing use of the land, geographical situation/location of the land alongwith the advantages/disadvantages i.e. distance from the National or State Highway or a road situated within a developed area etc. In urban area even a small distance makes a considerable difference in the price of land. However, the court should not take into consideration the use for which the land is sought to be acquired and its remote potential value in future. In arriving at the market value, it is the duty of the party to lead evidence in support of its case, in absence of which the court is not under a legal obligation to determine the market value merely as per the prayer of the claimant.\n\nThere may be a case where a huge tract of land is acquired which runs though continuous, but to the whole revenue estate of a village or to various revenue villages or even in two or more states. Someone's land may be adjacent to the main road, others' land may be far away, there may be persons having land abounding the main road but the frontage may be varied. Therefore, the market value of the land is to be determined taking into consideration the geographical situation and in such cases belting system may be applied. In such a fact-situation every claimant cannot claim the same rate of compensation.      [Para 15]"

Thus, on this basis since market value of land in vicinity was about Rs.18,000/- per hector, that too prior to two years to notification under S. 4 of Act, Reference Court considered acquired land as irrigated land, of which advantageous H. 3.57 R. was perennially irrigated, 0.80 R. Cultivable but fallow land and Pot Kharab land 0.20 R. were differently assessed for computing market value thereof. Separate compensation was not awarded for cattle shed as it was easily removable shed and capable of being taken away. Reference Court in facts mentioned justifiably awarded enhanced lump sum compensation for 1150 standing Orange trees on land at rate of Rs. 500/- per Orange tree rightly without adopting capitalizing method or using multiplier method after considering evidence of expert horticulturist as there was no dispute regarding number of Orange trees standing on land and compensation for irrigable land was already considered. As permission was sought by land owner to cut other trees for fuel and wood, other trees were not computed for to be valued. Since compensation for land was assessed considering it as perennially irrigated land sourced by water from well, separate compensation for 1150 standing orange trees could not have been computed by usual capitalizing by multiplier method. Lump sum compensation was granted as allowable in facts and circumstances of this case for assumption that damage was bound to result to standing Orange trees when possession of land was taken by Collector. Since wisdom of overall compensation awarded by reference Court appears assured just and fair returns to owners of acquired land, not further enhancement to it or reduction from it is necessary. Award of Reference Court is liable to be upheld.\t\t\t\t\t           [Para 11,12]"

Such opinion has to be founded on the need for immediate possession of the land for carrying out the purpose for which land is sought to be compulsorily acquired. The use of power of urgency under Section 17(1) and (4) of the Act ipso facto does not result in elimination of enquiry under Section 5A and, therefore, if the government intends to eliminate enquiry, then it has to apply its mind on the aspect that urgency is of such nature that necessitates elimination of such enquiry. The satisfaction of the government on twin aspects viz; (i) need for immediate possession of the land for carrying out the stated purpose and (ii) urgency is such that necessitates dispensation of enquiry is a must and permits no departure for a valid exercise of power under Section 17(1) and (4).\n\nWhere the government invokes urgency power under Section 17(1) and (4) for the public purpose like 'planned development of city' or 'development of residential area' or 'Residential Scheme', the initial presumption in favour of the government does not arise and the burden lies on the government to prove that the use of power was justified and dispensation of enquiry was necessary. In the instant case, the respondents authority have miserably failed to show to the satisfaction of the Court that power of urgency and dispensation of enquiry under Section 5A has been exercised with justification. The action of authority dispensing with provisions of Section 5A shall not apply, if allowed to stand, it would amount to depriving a person of his property without authority of law.

Section 3(d) of the Act defined \"Court\" as a Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction, unless the appropriate Government has appointed a Special Judicial Officer within any specified local limits to perform the functions of the Court under the Act.

In the considered view of the Court, this aspect is no longer res integra in view of the judgments of the Supreme Court in (1996)1 SCC 85 and AIR 1997 SC 1793. In view of these authoritative pronouncements, the Court is of the considered opinion that in the instant case the time began to run to make an application for re-determination from 15.6.1994 i.e., the date on which the Court, which necessarily means the reference Court, disposed of O.P.

Although the land whose sale is evidenced in Exhibit 1 is not an excellent comparison in terms of area, the same indicates a sales transaction completed at around the same time as the acquisition of the said land. Moreover, Exhibit 1 also concerns a plot that is in geographical proximity to the acquired land. There being no other evidence on record, and since we are not inclined to remand the matter after such a long delay, Exhibit 1 must be relied on with necessary scrutiny and caution. Reliance could be placed on the said documentary evidence for determining and assessing the compensation of the acquired land after giving the necessary deduction.

In other words, a reference under Section 18 can only be made by the Collector in respect of those issues, which are specified under Section 18. A dispute relating to non-award of interest payable to the landowners under Section 28 or/and Section 34 of the Act is not specified under Section 18 and hence it is not capable of being referred by the Collector to the Civil Court under Section 18 of the Act. It is also for the reason that payment of interest is statutory in character and being statutory, it is mandatory for payment once conditions specified under Sections 28 or/and 34 are fulfilled. It is true that once the interest is awarded by the Court under section 28 or by the Collector under Section 34 of the Act, it becomes the part of the award. However, it is hardly of any significance and has no bearing for deciding the question of remedy to challenge issue relating to the non-award of interest. Therefore, the dispute in relation to non-award of interest can be raised by an aggrieved person only by taking recourse to Article 226 of the Constitution in writ petition. In other words, reference under Section 18 or Section 28A(3) cannot be considered to be an alternative statutory remedy available to the landowner for getting the question of non-award of interest payable under Sections 28 or/and 34 of the Act decided by the Civil Court. \t\t\t\t [Para 36,37,38,42,44,45]"

A prudent owner would not put up any construction on the land and normally no one would come forward to purchase the land also as there would be possibility of the land being acquired. Therefore, declaration under Section 6 is required to be made as soon as possible. So far as provisions of Section 11A of the Act are concerned, they expect the acquiring authorities to make the award within two years so that the land owner can get compensation after the award is made. He must get his compensation at an early date because his land is acquired, but in case of delay caused in paying the compensation, the land owner would be sufficiently compensated in terms of money for the reason that he would be getting interest on the amount of compensation payable to him as per the provisions of the Act. Thus, in fact, not much harm is caused to the land owner if some delay is caused. \t\t\t   [Para 16]"

The Reference Court also took into consideration the two sale deeds relied upon by the  respondent for the purpose of fixing the market rate of the acquired land. No doubt, the plots in the sale deeds were developed plots, whereas the acquired land was a paddy field. But, there was no illegality or perversity in the findings record by the Reference Court while fixing the market rate of the acquired land since the Reference Court has deducted 80% from the price of the sale deed plots on the ground that the sale deed plots were developed plots,  whereas the acquired land was a paddy field and below the ground level and did not have direct access to the main road. Thus, the deductions made by the Reference Court are proper and the Reference Court has correctly arrived at the market rate of the acquired land after making appropriate deductions on the basis of the sale deed plots and after taking into consideration the location of the  acquired land and facilities available near the acquired land. \t [Para 8]"

The Court decided all the issues after holding that the applicant and his counsel are absent and no evidence has been led to substantiate the claim on merits. This dismissal of reference was on 13.08.2012. The petitioner who is the original applicant had two remedies, either to file Regular Civil Appeal under Section 54 of the Land Acquisition Act or to file an application under Order IX, Rule 13 of C.P.C to set aside the ex parte decree. The applicant has preferred an application under Order IX, Rule 9 read with Section 151 of C.P.C. for restoration of the Land Acquisition Reference case, proceeding on the footing that the reference need to be decided on merits after framing the application to lead evidence in support of the claim. In the absence of the applicant and his counsel before the Reference Court, which is an undisputed fact in the present case, according to the petitioner, the option with the Court was to dismiss the application in default and there was no occasion for the court to decide the case on merits. Therefore, presuming that the matter has been dismissed in the absence of the applicant and his counsel, the application under Order IX, Rule 9 of C.P.C is filed. The Apex Court has held that though an appeal would lie under Section 54 of the Land Acquisition Act against such an award, alternate remedy is also available. It further holds that whether the application is filed under Order IX Rule 9 of C.P.C or under Order 9 Rule 13 or under Section 151 C.P.C, it does not make any difference. In view of this, the trial Court has committed an error in holding that the application under Order IX Rule 9 of C.P.C read with Section 151 of C.P.C was not maintainable. The application should have been decided on its own merits and it should not have been dismissed on ground that it is not maintainable.\n\n(1996) 5 SCC 701 Foll.        [Para 2,3,4,6]"

When a notice under Section 12(2) of the Act is received, the landowner or person interested is made aware of all relevant particulars of the award which enables him to decide whether he should seek reference or not. On the other hand, if he only comes to know that an award has been made, he would require further time to make enquiries or secure copies so that he can ascertain the relevant particulars of the award. What needs to be emphasised is that along with the notice issued under Section 12(2) of the Act, the land owner who is not present or is not represented before the Collector at the time of making of award should be supplied with a copy thereof so that he may effectively exercise his right under Section 18(1) to seek reference to the Court.   [Para 11]\n\nIn this case a careful reading of the averments contained in the application filed by the appellant under Section 18(1) shows that the notice issued by the Collector under Section 12(2) was served upon him on 22.2.1985. Thereafter, his advocate obtained certified copy of the award and filed application dated 8.4.1985 for making a reference to the Court. This implies that copy of the award had not been sent to the appellant along with the notice and without that he could not have effectively made an application for seeking reference. On behalf of the State Government, no evidence was produced before the Reference Court to show that copy of the award was sent to the appellant along with the notice. Unfortunately, this aspect has been totally ignored by the Reference Court which mechanically concluded that the application filed on 8.4.1985 was beyond the time specified in Section 18(2)(b). The learned Single Judge of the High Court also committed serious error by approving the view taken by the Reference Court, albeit without considering the fact that the notice issued by the Collector under Section 12(2) was not accompanied by a copy of the award which was essential for effective exercise of right vested in the appellant to seek reference under Section 18(1).

Section 17(4) enables the State to take such possession even by dispensing with the requirement of the opportunity contemplated under Section 5A of the Act. Sections 17(1) and 17(2) on the one hand and Section 17(4) operates in two different fields. It is extent of urgency or emergency that would determine the application of the respective clauses/sub-sections of Section 17 of the L.A. Act. In other words, even though the urgency clause under Section 17(1) and Section 17(2) may be invoked in a given case, the opportunity of filing objections under Section 5A of the L.A. Act need not be dispensed with and can still be afforded. However, if the provisions of Section 17(4) are invoked, the State would be empowered to dispense with the requirement of affording opportunity under Section 5A and take possession prior to making of the award. The dispensation of the opportunity contemplated by Section 5A by invoking Section 17(4) is not an invariable consequence of the invocation of Sections 17(1) or (2).      [Para 16]\n\nWhat has happened in the present case is that even though the State had departed from its initial stand of invoking Section 17(4) of the Act and had given to the land-owners the opportunity contemplated by Section 5A, it had taken possession of the land prior to the passing of the award by invoking the provisions of Section 17(1) of the L.A. Act.     [Para 17]\n\nIn the present case compensation under Section 17(3A) was paid (on 18th April, 2006) after the date of taking over of possession (on 17th March, 2006), time and again, it has been held by the Court that the said fact by itself would not invalidate the acquisition. \n\nAIR 1964 SC 1217, 2004(5) ALL MR 1170 (S.C.), (2009) 10 SCC 689 Ref.to.

In the instant case, it is an undisputed fact that the license has been granted under Section 146 (ii) of Regulation, 1966 under Form AG3. The said prescribed Form does not stipulate the period of licensing right. In the absence of stipulation of period, the contention urged on behalf of Respondent No.1 that it is a perpetual license in respect of the acquired land is a tenable contention, particularly having regard to the classes of tenants defined under Section 141 of the Regulation, 1966 extracted supra. Respondent No.1 has acquired interest in the land in dispute, in terms of the notifications under Sections 4(1), 4(2) read with Section 17(1) of the L.A. Act, wherein the parts and parcels of land along with building structures, the trees and crops have been clearly mentioned. Such an interest could only be extinguished in terms of Section 162 of the Regulation, 1966. That is to say that the right of Respondent No.1 could be extinguished only in terms of a notification to acquire the land. That was done by the Lieutenant Governor of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, who issued notifications to acquire the land, building structures including the standing trees and crops. The Award has been passed on a part of this land. The Award on the remaining 6 hectares of land was not passed by the Land Acquisition Collector, even though the entire land including the building structures, the trees and crops had been acquired for the aforesaid purpose of establishing industry. Not awarding compensation as provided under Section 11 of the L.A. Act amounts to deliberate omission in discharge of statutory duty by the Collector, despite the statutory right vesting in Respondent No.1 for award of compensation in lieu of losing the holding rights over the land on account of acquisition of the same by the Government. Therefore, Respondent No.1 rightly approached the High Court praying that the Writ of Mandamus be issued to the Review Petitioners-Appellants to pass an Award of compensation in its favour in respect of the remaining land.\n\n2013 ALL SCR 799, 2004(5) ALL MR 79 (S.C.), AIR 1965 Mysore 222, AIR 1968 SC 1045 Disting. \t\t [Para 11]"

Section 11-A of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, added to the statute in September 1984, provides that the award shall be made under Section 11 of the said Act within a period of two years of the declaration under Section 6 of the Act and if no award is made within the said period, the entire process for acquisition shall stand lapsed. In the case at hand the acquisition proceedings had started before the insertion of Section 11-A in the statute book. Proviso to Section 11-A would therefore apply and permit the making of an award within a period of two years from the date the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act 1984 came into force. The said amendment came into force on 24th September, 1984. In terms of the proviso, therefore, the award in respect of the acquisition at hand could have been made till September 1986, by the latest. No such award was however made till September 1986 or at any time even thereafter till 2011, when the Collector did so, pursuant to the direction of the High Court. That award is on the face of it non-est in the eyes of law. The net effect of the above is that the entire process commencing with the publication of the Notification under Section 4 and declaration under Section 6 had lapsed and no award could be lawfully made or directed to be made by the High Court in exercise of its power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Inasmuch as learned Single Judge directed a decision to be taken by the competent authority it could only mean that the competent authority would be free to initiate the process of acquisition rather than taking the lapsed proceedings further by making an award beyond the statutory period. Inasmuch as the Division Bench directed compensation to be determined that too by appointing a special officer for that purpose, it fell in a palpable error.  [Para 9,10]"

It is kept in mind that those land owners who are agriculturist in most of the cases, and whose land is acquired for public purpose should get fair compensation. Once a particular rate of compensation is judicially determined, which becomes a fair compensation, benefit thereof is to be given even to those who could not approach the court. It is with this aim the aforesaid provision is incorporated by the Legislature. Once we keep the aforesaid purpose in mind, the mere fact that the compensation which was claimed by some of the villagers was at lesser rate than the compensation which is ultimately determined to be fair compensation, should not be a ground to deny such persons appropriate and fair compensation on the ground that they claimed compensation at a lesser rate. In such cases, strict rule of pleadings are not be made applicable and rendering substantial justice to the parties has to be the paramount consideration. \n\n\tIn order to ensure that the land owners are given proper compensation, the Act provides for 'fair compensation'. Once such a fair compensation is determined judicially, all land owners whose land was taken away by the same Notification should become the beneficiary thereof. Not only it is an aspect of good governance, failing to do so would also amount to discrimination by giving different treatment to thepersons though identically situated. On technical grounds, like the one adopted by the High Court in the impugned judgment, this fair treatment cannot be denied to them.\n\n\tFrom the human rights perspective, persons belonging to the weaker sections are disadvantaged people who are unable to acquire and use their rights because of poverty, social or other constraints. They are not in a position to approach the courts even when their rights are violated; they are victimized or deprived of their legitimate due. Here lies the importance of access to justice for socially and economically disadvantaged people. When such people are denied the basic right of survival and access to justice, it further aggravates their poverty. Therefore, even in order to eliminate poverty, access to justice to the poor sections of the society becomes imperative. In the instant case, it is the poverty which compelled the appellants to restrict the claim to Rs.115/- per sq. yard, as they were not in a position to pay the court fee on a higher amount.\n\n\tIt is the aforesaid weighty consideration which justify award of compensation to the appellants at the rate of Rs.297/- per square yards.\n\n\tSimply because the appellants had paid court fee on the claim at the rate of Rs.115/- square yards could not be the reason to deny the compensation at a higher rate. This could be taken care of by directing the appellants to pay the difference in court fee after calculating the same at the rate of Rs.297/- per square yards. \n\n2016 ALL SCR 778 Rel.on.\t [Para 6,7,12,13,16]"

Besides, the Reference Court also assessed the evidence of the valuer who had examined the Sale Deeds and on a consideration of the judgment in Ambya Kalya Mhatre [2011(6) ALL MR 974 (S.C.)], rightly came to a conclusion that the Reference Court could grant a higher compensation if the Court finds that the higher amount is the actual market value of the acquired land. The Reference Court for that matter considered the Sale instances dated 2/05/2008 and 12/05/2008 though in respect of small developed plots and that there was no evidence in rebuttal led by the respondents and on consideration of the fact that there was an escalation in the land prices by 10% each year held that the market value of the acquired land as on the date of Section 4 Notification was Rs.222/- per sq. mt. in respect of some survey holdings and Rs.189/- per sq. mt. in respect of the two survey holdings. The Reference Court for that matter had also considered the plea raised on behalf of the appellant that the lands were agricultural tenanted lands and being hit by Section 2 of the Goa Land Use (Regulation) Act, 1991. However, the Reference Court considered the judgment of the Apex Court in Goa Housing Board [2011 ALL SCR 2723], and made an appropriate deduction in respect of the land qua the issue of tenancy as also that in Vishnu Naik [2008(5) ALL MR 844], and after making 50% deduction from the market value of the lands which were the subject matters of the Sale instances arrived at the market value of the lands at Rs.189/- per sq. mt. and Rs.222/- per sq. mt. The Reference Court for that matter was equally seized of the fact that the two survey holdings were the large tracts as compared to the other survey holdings and made further deduction of 15% and fixed the market value at Rs.189/- per sq. mt. The findings thus rendered by the Reference Court therefore are not at all perverse much less illegal as to call for an interference in appeal. 2011(6) ALL MR 974 (S.C.)

It is thus clear from S.34 that the expression \"awarded amount\" would mean the amount of compensation worked out in accordance with the provisions contained in S.23, including all the sub-sections thereof.\t\t [Para 23]\n\nWhat the legislature intended was to make the aggregate amount under Section 23 of the Act to reach the hands of the person as and when the award is passed, at any rate as soon as he is deprived of the possession of his land. Any delay in making payment of the said sum should enable the party to have interest on the said sum until he receives the payment. Splitting up the compensation into different components for the purpose of payment of interest under Section 34 was not in the contemplation of the legislature when that section was framed or enacted.\t [Para 24]\n\nCompulsory nature of acquisition is to be distinguished from voluntary sale or transfer. In the latter, the landowner has the widest advantage in finding out a would-be buyer and in negotiating with him regarding the sale price. Even in such negotiations or haggling normally no landowner would bargain for any amount in consideration of his disinclination to part with the land. The mere fact that he is negotiating for sale of the land would show that he is willing to part with the land. The owner is free to settle terms of transfer and choose the buyer as also to appoint the point of time when he would be receiving consideration and parting with his title and possession over the land. But in the compulsory acquisition the landowner is deprived of the right and opportunity to negotiate and bargain for the sale price. It depends on what the Collector or the Court fixes as per the provisions of the Act. The solatium envisaged in sub-section (2) \"in consideration of the compulsory nature of the acquisition\" is thus not the same as damages on account of the disinclination to part with the land acquired.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 22]"

Reference Court was equally seized of the fact that the applicant had been unrebutted in his testimony that there was a scarcity of land available in Margao and prices of the land were rising and amenities like water, electricity etc. apart from important development were close to the acquired land. Reference Court had observed that the statement of the applicant was not at all disputed and still on examining the sale instance where the land was sold Rs.546/- per sq.mt. held that it did not bear any similarity to the acquired land and found favour with the contention on behalf of the respondents that it did not depict the true market rate of the land in the year 1990 and brushed it aside. Reference Court also did not consider the fact as borne out from the evidence that there was severance of the property and that he would suffer a loss when he undertook development. Reference Court ignored the sale instance on the specious premise that the vendors in that deed had transferred the undivided right in the land on which the buildings had been constructed by the confirming party in favour of the purchasers and chose to ignore the Deed as a reference for computing the market rate of the acquired land. It was completely lost on Reference Court that the parties had agreed to the price of the land and subsequent construction of the building had no bearing thereon and hence Reference Court was in error to ignore the sale instance.\t [Para 20]\n\nReference Court therefore ought to have considered the said sale instance in respect of the land sold in 1990 which was pursuant to an agreement of the previous year i.e. 1989 as the basis for computing the market value of the acquired land which it failed to do. For that matter Reference Court could also have looked into the award in respect of the land acquired much earlier where an award was made on 12/07/2001 where the market value of the acquired land was fixed Rs.267/- per sq.mt. in 1981 and acquired for the construction of multipurpose stadium at Fatorda in 1981. Reference Court ought to have relied on the said instance in particular in respect of an area of 1126 sq.mts. unlike the property of the applicant which was around 3000 sq.mts. and a portion admeasuring 227 sq.mts. had been acquired for the stated purpose. Therefore considering the sale instance of 1990 viz-a-viz the areas of the acquired land and after making necessary deductions towards development @30%, the market value is worked out at Rs.382/- per sq.mt. Further, giving 10% escalation the rate would work out to Rs.420/- per sq.mt. as on the date of the Section 4 Notification. \t [Para 21]\n\nReference Court was conscious of the fact that the property of the applicant was severed but was unduly swayed by the statement of the appellant that he intended to do construction in the remaining portion of his property. For that matter, the Reference Court had considered the statement of the expert who had stated that he would have to keep setback areas as also the road widening areas on both the sides as also the severed portion and yet Reference Court in her wisdom hastily concluded that there was no material to prove that by reason of the acquisition, the remaining land was injuriously affected and denied the severance charges. This view of Reference Court calls for an interference in the face of the evidence led by the appellant and that of his expert and hence he is entitled to the severance charges to the extent of 20% of the market rate fixed in his favour.\t [Para 22]\n\nThus, the impugned Judgment and Award is modified to the extent that the applicant is held entitled to the compensation on the basis of the enhanced market value of the acquired land on the date of the Section 4 Notification Rs.420/- per sq.mt. He is also held entitled to the severance charges and all the other statutory benefits in terms of Section 23(1-A), 23(2) and 28 of the Act and the costs of the appeal.   [Para 23]"

It is for the claimant to produce the material evidence for enhancement of the price of acquired land.  In the present matter, claimants have not produced any evidence as regards market value prevailing at the time of notification under Section 4(1) of the Act.  Similarly, the respondent/State has also not produced any evidence nor relied upon any material i.e. sale instances referred to by the Land Acquisition Officer in the award.  Suffice for our purpose to say that there was absolutely no evidence as regards the market value of the lands prevailing during the relevant period of the notification under Section 4 of the Act before the Reference Court.  It is enough to point out that in the light of the foregoing dicta of the Supreme Court, without more, the claimants were plaintiffs before the Reference court and References filed by them were the original proceedings to determine the market value of the lands and as the claimants failed to produce material evidence for enhancement of the price of the acquired lands, the Reference Court was not justified, at any rate, in awarding the enhanced compensation without any evidence before it.

                "description": "Approval by Commissioner - Is administrative in nature - He cannot sit in appeal over proposed award - Matter, however, referred to a larger Bench in view of conflicting view in 1998(2) SCC 573 and in Civil Appeal No.7695 of 1997, dt:13.11.1997.\n\nWords and Phrases - Word \"approval\" - Connotation of.\n\nWhat is provided under the proviso to Section 11(1) is that the proposed award made by the Collector must have the approval of the appropriate Government or such officer as the appropriate Government may authorise in that behalf. In our opinion, this power of granting or not granting previous approval cannot be equated with an appellate power. Black's Law Dictionary, 6th Edition, defines 'approval' to mean an act of confirming, ratifying, assenting, sanctioning or consenting to some act or thing done by another. In the context of an administrative act, the word 'approval' in our opinion, does not mean anything more than either confirming, ratifying, assenting, sanctioning or consenting. It will be doing violence to the Scheme of the Act if we have to construe and accept the argument of learned counsel for the respondents that the word approval found in the proviso to Section 11(1) of the Act under the Scheme of the Act amounts to an appellate power. On the contrary, we are of the opinion that this is only an administrative power which limits the jurisdiction of the authority to apply his mind to see whether the proposed award is acceptable to the Government or not. In that process for the purpose of forming an opinion to approve or not to approve the proposed award the Commissioner may satisfy himself as to the material relied upon by the Collector but he cannot reverse the finding as if he is appellate authority for the purpose of remanding the matter to the Collector as can be done by an appellate authority; much less can the Commissioner exercising the said power of prior approval, give directions to the statutory authority in what manner he should accept/appreciate the material on record in regard to the compensation payable. If such a power of issuing direction to the Collector by the Commissioner under the provision of law referred to hereinabove is to be accepted then it would mean that the Commissioner is empowered to exercise the said power to substitute his opinion to that of the Collector's opinion for the purpose of fixing the compensation which is opposed to the language of Section 11 of the Act. The Act has not conferred an appellate jurisdiction, on the Commissioner under Section 15(1) proviso of the Act. This conclusion is further supported by the scheme of the Act and Section 15A of the Act which is also introduced in the Act simultaneously with the proviso to Section 11(1) under Act 68 of 1984. By this amendment, the Act has given a power akin to the appellate power to the State Government to call for any records or proceedings of the Collector before any award is made, for the purpose of satisfying itself as to the legality or propriety of any finding or order passed or as to the irregularity of such proceedings and to pass such other order or issue such direction in relation thereto as it may think fit. Therefore it is not as if the acquiring authority namely the appropriate Government even if aggrieved by the fixation of compensation by the Collector it has no remedy.  It can very well exercise the power under Section 15A and pass such orders as it thinks fit, of course, after affording an opportunity to such person who is likely to be prejudicially affected by such order of the appropriate Government, therefore, it is clear that the statute when it intended to give appellate or revisional power against the finding of the Collector in the fixation of compensation it has provided such power separately in Section 15A of the Act. Therefore, if the Commissioner while considering the proposed award of the Collector under the proviso to Section 11(1) of the Act to grant or not to grant approval if he thinks that the order of the Collector cannot be approved, he can at the most on the administrative side bring it to the notice of the appropriate Government to exercise its power under Section 15A of the Act, but he cannot as in the present case on his own exercise the said power because that power under Section 15A is confined to the appropriate Government only.\t [Para 9]"

The Collector cannot keep track of all those subsequent developments and, therefore, looking to the role of the Collector under Sections 18 and 19, it has to be held that it is for the claimants or the applicants under Section 18 or the persons mentioned in sub-sections (a) and (b) of Section 20 to prosecute and pursue their claim.  They must be diligent and must take all the steps in prosecuting the reference which include bringing the legal representatives of the deceased claimant on record.  If some of the claimants or some of the persons mentioned in sub-sections (a) and (b) of Section 20 die during proceeding, then like all other civil cases, their representatives who are may be or other claimants must make an application to the Court for bringing the legal representatives of the deceased claimant on record.  In fact the Court issues notice to the claimants under the provisions of Land Acquisition Act as stated above then it is not only a notice requiring them to appear but it is also a notice that Civil Court has taken cognizance of the matter and the matter will be dealt with or decided by the Civil Court.  Therefore, even legally it is the duty of the claimants to take necessary steps in bringing the legal representatives on record.\n\nIn this background it has to be held that it is not the duty of the Land Acquisition Officer or the Collector to apply for bringing the legal representatives of the deceased claimant on record.

When the land is being compulsorily taken away from a person, he is entitled to the highest value which similar land in the locality is shown to have fetched in a bona fide transaction entered into between a willing purchaser and a willing seller near about the time of the acquisition. In our view, it seems to be only fair that where sale deeds pertaining to different transactions are relied on behalf of the Government, the transaction representing the highest value should be preferred to the rest unless there are strong circumstances justifying a different course. It is not desirable to take an average of various sale deeds placed before the authority/court for fixing fair compensation. Held the appellants have made out a case for enhancement of compensation.

As regards the guidelines provided in the letter dated June 26, 1991, this Court has already held that classification on the basis of nature of construction cannot be validly made and such policy is not based on intelligible differentia and a rational basis. What appears from the available material is that for release of the lands under the subject acquisition, no policy has been adhered to. This leads to an irresistible conclusion that no firm policy with regard to release of land from acquisition existed. It is true that any action or order contrary to law does not confer any right upon any person for similar treatment. It is equally true that a landowner whose land has been acquired for public purpose by following the prescribed procedure cannot claim as a matter of right for release of his/her land from acquisition but where the State Government exercises its power under Section 48 of the Act for withdrawal from acquisition in respect of a particular land, the landowners who are similarly situated have right of similar treatment by the State Government. Equality of citizens' rights is one of the fundamental pillars on which edifice of rule of law rests. Consequently, the Government has obligation of acting with substantial fairness and consistency in considering the representations of the landowners for withdrawal from acquisition whose lands have been acquired under the same acquisition proceedings. The State Government cannot pick and choose some landowners and release their land from acquisition and deny the same benefit to other landowners by creating artificial distinction. Passing different orders in exercise of its power under Section 48 of the Act in respect of persons similarly situated relating to same acquisition proceedings and for same public purpose is definitely violative of Article 14 of the Constitution and must be held to be discriminatory. The action of State Government in treating the present appellants differently although they are situated similar to the landowners whose lands have been released can not be countenanced and has to be declared bad in law.

                "description": "Compensation - Classification of lands on basis of land revenue assessment is just and proper.\n\nAs regards classification of the lands the land assessment is fixed after taking into consideration various aspects, such as, quality of soil, the condition of the land, topography and location of the lands. There is no dispute that applying modern methods of cultivation and by constructing bunds etc., the lands can be improved, but still the basic difference between the lands having fertile soil and the lands having ordinary or poor soil, cannot be ignored. If soil is very fertile in case of irrigated land, then there is possibility of more income, whereas in case the land is not so fertile, then even with the irrigation facility, such land would not give much income and at least to obtain more income, fertilizers and manures would be required to be used which would increase the cost of cultivation, if the soil is not fertile. Hence, it is apparent that all the lands cannot be treated alike and difference will have to be maintained on the basis of fertility of the lands. Hence, other things being equal, the land revenue assessment is the only criteria on the basis of which superiority or otherwise of the land can be judged. Therefore, classification done by the S.L.A.O. on the basis of land revenue assessment appears to be just and proper.  [Para 12]\n\nAlso, the market value of the land can be determined on the basis of following parameters.\n\n(i)\tPrice paid for the same land or portion of it in recent years, after making all necessary allowances for lapse of time, advantage of situation and other possible differences between lands sold and the lands to be acquired.\n\n(ii)\tPrice paid for similar lands in the vicinity in recent years after making all proper allowances for lapse of time, advantage of situation etc. and\n\n(iii)\tNet annual income from the land, which may be capitalised at a certain number of years, number of years dependent upon the nature of property, the state of money market and other circumstances of the case.

The area which was acquired was 1130 acres and 4 marlas, only a small portion of which abutted on the National Highway No. 8. Even if one was to disregard the quality of the land i.e. irrigated, semi irrigated or barren, one cannot be oblivious of the fact that the market value of land which abuts on the National Highway would be much more than the land which is away from it. A price of the land which is land-locked and which is further away from the National Highway cannot be the same as that which abuts on the National Highway. The formula which had been applied by the High Court, however, seems to indicate that the price of the entire land irrespective of the location of different parcels of land is the same. The formula which was applied by the learned single Judge of the High Court is obviously incorrect.  [Para 8]"

Therefore, the date on which the Notification under S.6 was published in local newspapers had to be taken as the date for commencement of limitation under S.11-A and the award was passed beyond the period of two years from that date, however, possession of the land was taken by the acquiring body from the claimant and this was before initiation of acquisition proceedings.  Thus, although urgency clause u/s 17(1) was not applied, in order to enable the respondents to take possession of the land immediately after notices u/s 9 and before declaration of the award, fact remains that petitioner was divested of the possession even before declaration u/s 6.  It is also admitted position that after award the petitioner has accepted the compensation, may be under protest regarding the quantum, upon service of notice u/s 12(2) of the Act.  All these admitted facts clearly indicate that the acquisition proceedings have all the requirements and trappings of urgency acquisition.  Although notice u/s 4 or declaration u/s 6 did not make a reference to Section 17(1), omission can be seen for obvious reasons.  The exercise of powers u/s 17(1) was not necessary in view of the fact that the land owners had delivered the possession to acquiring body by private negotiations in anticipation of the acquisition proceedings.  Even in the matters where the possession is taken at any stage, before the notice u/s 9(3) and (4) of the Land Acquisition Act, the limitation prescribed by Section 11-A would not apply, more so when the facts and circumstances clearly indicate that land owners were divested of the possession in favour of the acquiring body in view of urgency of the purpose.

Against the backdrop of the aforesaid legal position, adverting to the evidence on record, it is seen that the acquired land is a large tract of land; it admeasures 85, 856 sq.metres. The acquired land is quite interior from the main road.  Though, there is conflicting evidence about the acquired land having access through a tar road, from the evidence, it is amply clear that the acquired land does not have direct motorable road from the main road. In so far as the civil amenities are concerned, the evidence suggests that the amenities like transport, water, electricity, temple, mosque and church etc. are at a distance of half a kilometre to one kilometre . The Dabolim Railway Station is also about 0.7 kms. In so far as the nine Sale Deeds which have been produced by the claimants are concerned, these relate to small plots of land of about 225 to 355 sq. metres. Those plots of lands at the time of sale were fully developed and abutting the main road. The plots that have been sold by these Sale Deeds are at a distance of about 0.8 kms from the acquired land. Strictly speaking, the sale instances produced by the claimants cannot be said to be comparable to the acquired land but asking the claimants to produce the sale instance of similarly situated large tract of land was asking the impossible. For want of definite evidence regarding sale of similar situated plots, the Sale Deeds produced by the claimants can be co-related to find out the index of the market value.  The broad factors that need to be kept in mind are that the Sale Deeds relate to developed small plots of land adjacent to the main road; the acquired land on the other hand is interior and one has to travel almost 1/2 km. to 3/4 kms. inside the main road to reach the acquired land. The acquired land is totally undeveloped though it is close to the already existing Sancoale Industrial Estate. The small plots of which the Sale Deeds were produced were sold for a price between Rs.100/- to Rs.132/- per sq.metre.  Where the Sale Deed of a developed plot is treated a comparable sale instance, 40% deduction needs to be made to find out the market value of undeveloped land. Then it cannot be overlooked that besides that the acquired land is undeveloped, there is difference in the location as well. As already indicated above, the Sale Deeds relate to the sale of plot of land which abut the main road whereas the acquired plot of land is situated in the area interior at a distance of more than half a kilometre from the main road.  This aspect also has to be borne in mind to arrive at the index of market value. AIR 1988 SC 1652 and 1998(1) G.L.T. 324 - Referred to.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 12,13]"

The terminal point for the purpose is either the date of the award or the date of taking possession, whichever is earlier. In the present case, possession of the land having been taken prior to the publication of the Section 4 notification, that terminal is not available. The only available terminal is the date of the award. The High Court, therefore, was in no error in holding that the appellants were entitled to the-additional compensation under Section 23(1A) for the period from date of notification to date of award. There is no room here for any construction other than that given above. It is only where a provision is ambiguous that a construction that leads to a result that is more just can be adopted.

As the Award under Sub-Section 2 of Section 28A is on par with an Award under Section 11, the reference in Section 18 to the Award will have to be also read as a reference to an Award under Sub-Section 2 of Section 28(A). Therefore, the period of limitation provided in Section 18 will apply to an Application for Reference under Sub-Section (3) of Section 28.

The issue before the Constitution Bench was not relatable to any award as such passed after the amended date.\n\n In K.S. Paripoornan (II) (supra), the three-Judge Bench appreciated the law laid down in Raghubir Singh's case and referred to Section 30(2) of the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act, 1984 (68 of 1984) which was a transitory provision.\n\n On a perusal of the principle stated in Raghubir Singh case and what has been clarified in K.S. Paripoornan (II) case, it is not found that the three-Judge Bench decision runs counter to the authority in the Constitution Bench. It also does not give a different interpretation to Section 30(2) that what has been stated by the Constitution Bench. In fact, K.S. Paripoornan (II) clearly postulates about the awards that have been passed by the court after the Act has come into force which is in consonance with the ratio laid down in Raghubir Singh's case. The three-Judge Bench has only observed that the restricted interpretation placed by the Constitution Bench in Raghubir Singh (supra) should not convey that Section 23(2) would not apply to the awards of the civil court pending at the time when the Act came into force or thereafter. Thus, the controversy with which the three- Judge Bench was dealing with was absolutely different and the view expressed by it is absolutely in accord with the principles laid down in Raghubir Singh's case. Additionally, it is also in consonance with the provisions contained in Section 23(2) of the Act. \n\n(1989) 2 SCC 754 Foll.\n\n(1995) 1 SCC 367 Approved.   [Para 9,10,11]"

It is true that power conferred upon the government under Section 17 is administrative and its opinion is entitled to due weight, but in a case where the opinion is formed regarding the urgency based on considerations not germane to the purpose, the judicial review of such administrative decision may become necessary. As to in what circumstances the power of emergency can be invoked are specified in Section 17(2) but circumstances necessitating invocation of urgency under Section 17(1) are not stated in the provision itself. Generally speaking, the development of an area (for residential purposes) or a planned development of city, takes many years if not decades and, therefore, there is no reason why summary enquiry as contemplated under Section 5-A may not be held and objections of land owners/persons interested may not be considered. In many cases on general assumption, likely delay in completion of enquiry under Section 5-A is set up as a reason for invocation of extraordinary power in dispensing with the enquiry little realizing that an important and valuable right of the person interested in the land is being taken away and with some effort enquiry could always be completed expeditiously. The special provision has been made in Section 17 to eliminate enquiry under Section 5-A in deserving and cases of real urgency. The government has to apply its mind on the aspect that urgency is of such nature that necessitates dispensation of enquiry under Section 5-A.  [Para 30]\n\nThe Government must, therefore, do a balancing act and resort to the special power of urgency under Section 17 in the matters of acquisition of land for the public purpose viz.; 'planned development of city' or 'for development of residential area' in exceptional situation. Use of the power by the government under Section 17 for 'planned development of the city' or 'the development of residential area' or for 'housing' must not be as a rule but by way of an exception. Such exceptional situation may be for the public purpose viz., rehabilitation of natural calamity affected persons; rehabilitation of persons uprooted due to commissioning of dam or housing for lower strata of the society urgently; rehabilitation of persons affected by time bound projects, etc.. The list is only illustrative and not exhaustive. In any case, sans real urgency and need for immediate possession of the land for carrying out the stated purpose, heavy onus lies on the government to justify exercise of such power. It must, therefore, be held that the use of the power of urgency and dispensation of enquiry under Section 5-A by the government in a routine manner for the 'planned development of city' or 'development of residential area' and thereby depriving the owner or person interested a very valuable right under Section 5-A may not meet the statutory test nor could be readily sustained.

This onus is discharged by asserting these facts on oath. He is not expected to prove the negative.

For next almost three years, the officers of the DTL and the DDA exchanged letters on the issue of allotment of land. On 28.7.2008 Secretary (Power), Government of NCT of Delhi-cum-CMD, DTL made a suggestion for the acquisition of land by invoking Section 17 of the Act. This became a tool in the hands of the concerned authorities and the Lieutenant Governor mechanically approved the proposal contained in the file without trying to find out as to why the urgency provisions were being invoked after a time gap of five years. If the sub-station was to be established on emergency basis, the authorities of the DTL would not have waited for five years for the invoking of urgency provisions enshrined in the Act. They would have immediately approached the Government of NCT of Delhi and made a request that land be acquired by invoking Section 17 of the Act. However, the fact of the matter is that the concerned officers / functionaries of the DTL, the DDA and the Government of NCT of Delhi leisurely dealt with the matter for over five years. Even after some sign of emergency was indicated in letter dated 9.9.2008 of the Joint Secretary (Power), who made a mention of the Commonwealth Games scheduled to be organised in October, 2010, it took more than one year and two months to the competent authority to issue the preliminary notification. Therefore, it is difficult to approve the view taken by the High Court on the sustainability of the appellants' challenge to the acquisition of their land.  [Para 22]"

                "description": "Determination of compensation - Additional benefit - Additional benefit is admissible in law and payable to claimants for the period commencing from the date of publication of notification under S.4 of the Act till possession or date of award whichever is earlier.\n\nThe additional benefit is admissible in law and payable to the claimants for the period commencing from the date of publication of notification Under Section 4 of the Act till possession or date of award whichever is earlier. The most important expression in the provision of Section 23(1-A) wherever the additional benefit is to be given till the date of possession is \"possession\". The word \"possession\" has been explained differently in different contexts.\n\nThe possession is a legal right and it must arise legally. For possession to be accepted in law, the Court should be satisfied that possession has been acquired by the concerned party by due process of law and is not result of an unlawful act. Now let us examine the legislative scheme in relation to taking over of possession by the Government or its agencies under the provisions of the Act. The provisions of the Act contemplate only two methods for acquiring possession in accordance with law. Firstly, the Government acting through the Collector and after issuance of the notification under Section 4 and declaration under Section 6 of the Act is required to serve notice to all interested persons under Section 9(1) of the Act informing that the Government intends to take possession of the land and interested persons may make their claim for compensation in such land to him. The Collector thereupon shall conduct an enquiry as contemplated under Section 11 of the Act and make his award determining the market value of the acquired land. It is only after this procedure is completed that the Collector is entitled to take possession as per the provisions of Section 16 of the Act and then alone the land shall vest absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances. Secondly, the legislature has vested special powers in the Appropriate Government to direct the Collector to take immediate possession under different circumstances by invoking the urgency clause. The Collector is empowered to take possession for immediate public purpose by serving fifteen days' notice even where no award has been made in terms of Section 11 of the Act. The Collector is even empowered to take possession by giving 48 hours notice but for possession in terms of sub-sections (1) and (2), the statute casts an obligation upon the said authority to pay compensation to the claimant. This compensation could be in relation to damage to any crop, structure, water supply, etc. and in any case before taking possession of the land the Collector, in terms of Section 17(3-A)(a) of the Act has to tender payment of 80 per cent of the compensation for such land as estimated by him to persons whose lands are acquired. The law requires that the compensation should be paid to the claimants unless and until the Collector is prevented by circumstances postulated under Section 31 of the Act. Even if that be so, still the Collector would be required to deposit the compensation in the Court as commanded under Section 31 of the Act. In other words, the Government is entitled to take immediate possession of the land but only and upon making payment of 80 per cent of the proposed market value of the land in question. There is no other way by which the Government or any other instrumentality of the Government can take possession of the land under the provisions of the Act. The Legislature has emphasized the need for payment of compensation prior to taking physical possession of the property in either case. The Court cannot ignore the fact that these are cases of compulsory acquisition and compliance to the statutory provisions would be mandatory. The State cannot take benefit of any of the provisions of the statute without satisfying the requirements or conditions precedent to such invocation. This onus is clearly upon the State to show that they have taken the possession of the land in accordance with the provisions of the Act and the term possession is \"lawful possession\". When the Act in no uncertain terms provides the methodology which is to be adopted by the authorities of the State in taking possession then it is mandatory for these authorities to take possession only in accordance with the provisions and no other way. Possession must be taken by a duly authorized person and in accordance with law. There is no necessity for the authorities of the State to create a mechanism of taking possession which is not in conformity with the statutory requirements. The State cannot defend against the provisions of law.  2004(5) ALL MR (S.C.) 435 - Ref. to.\t\t\t\t\t       [Para 10,12]"

It is, therefore, obvious that the owner is divested of his land though compensation thereof is not determined at all. The determination for the first time takes place via Section 14 and it may take place in a given case even after taking of possession under Section 12 as Coal Bearing Act does not prohibit it. The contention that Section 9(1) Notification, therefore, should be equated with award under Section 11 of Land Acquisition Act is without substance. In fact such an analogy can not be resorted to because of express provisions of Coal Bearing Act which contemplate determination of compensation for the first time by the Special Tribunal vide its Section 14. If the market value or compensation determined is in view of the agreement between parties, it is apparent that there need not be any recourse to Section 14 of Coal Bearing Act. The question crops up only when there is no such agreement and the amount offered by acquiring body is disputed by the land owner. Thus, an independent or impartial agency for the first time determines the compensation under Section 14 in said scheme.   [Para 12]"

The determination of market value via Section 14 is part and parcel of acquisition proceedings and though land is vested in Central Government, the proceedings for its determination continue even thereafter before the Special Tribunal. Though authority under the Rules framed under Coal Bearing Act invite claims, it is not obligatory for them to work out compensation amount before publication of Section 9(1) notification or before vesting. This is unlike Section 11 of Land Acquisition Act where award is published only after the compensation amount is determined after inquiry & considering the claims of owners. A award declared under Section 14(5) by Special Tribunal is the first stage at which the market value & compensation is statutorily determinable under the Coal Bearing Act, 1957. Section 14 is the first provision which uses the word \"award\" & its sub-section (5) mandates Special Tribunal to determine just compensation after hearing the dispute before it. The date of notification under Section 9(1) of Coal Bearing Act mentioned in Circular dated 12.5.1989, therefore, cannot be a cut off date for the purpose of deciding the grant of escalation amount of 12%. Final declaration of acquisition and vesting of land without consequential statutory determination of compensation therefor can not be the end of any statutory land acquisition. The land acquisition proceedings in Coal Bearing Act can not end only because landowners are divested of their lands and remain pending till statutory determination of compensation payable to them.\n\nHeld, acquisition proceedings continue till the compensation amount is worked out after holding statutory inquiry as per Section 14 thereof. As claims for compensation as per Rule 5-A of Coal Bearing Rules are to be filed after vesting itself, determination of compensation is also possible only after Section 9 notification & hence date of Section 9 notification can not be relevant at all & date of award of special tribunal under Section 14(5) of Coal Bearing Act has to be the crucial date.\n\nEven if notification under Section 9(1) is published before 30.4.1982 but proceedings for determination of compensation under Section 14 of Coal Bearing Act are pending before the Special Tribunal on said date or are decided by Special Tribunal after said date, the land owner is eligible to claim benefit of escalation amount of 12% per annum in terms of para 3 of Circular dated 12.5.1989.

In the absence of such important material,  to sale instances produced in a case  cannot be said to have been proved.

This does not exclude either specifically or by implication any of the three methods indicated in the section. In other words, it is the composite compliance to the provisions of Section 4(1) of the Act which would be the complete stage for taking further proceedings in the acquisition of acquired land. Every irregularity would not vitiate the acquisition proceedings as bad in law but its total non-compliance to the mandatory provisions may adversely affect the acquisition proceedings. Despite the fact that publication in the newspaper as well as display of notices at convenient places in the locality is a mandatory condition but the material date for determining the market value of the land would and should be the date on which the notification is published in the official gazette. For this, two reasons can be stated. One that the sale deeds or transfers executed by any party after publication of the notification in the official gazette is not binding on the State and is inconsequential. In other words, Section 4 puts a kind of embargo upon transfer of the properties which are subject matter of acquisition proceedings. Secondly, publication in the official gazette is accepted in law as notice to all and there is a presumption in favour of the notification and its contents. There would be more than three dates which may be pleaded to be relevant for determination of the market value. Firstly the date of notification, secondly when the notification was published in the official gazette, thirdly the date/s on which the notification was published in two newspapers circulated in the locality and finally the date/s on which the Collector would issue the substance of the notifications by publishing notice at convenient places in the locality. If the arguments advanced on behalf of the claimants is taken to its logical end, there will always be a dispute of fact as to which is the relevant date and whether which date satisfies the prerequisite of compliance to Section 4 of the Act.\t\t\t\t [Para 14]"

In other words, application under Section 18 is not a mere formality but is exercise of a substantive legal right in the manner specified in the provisions.  The expression \"shall\" has been cautiously used by the Legislature which indicates its intent that the application should state grounds on which objection or exception to the Award is being taken. It is expected of the Applicant to be aware of what was the value of his land at the time of issuance of the Notification under Section 4 of the Act as that date alone is relevant for determining compensation payable to the Claimants. He is at liberty to raise all factual and legal objections. This is a reference by the Collector to the Court of competent jurisdiction and proceedings of reference are expected to be carried out in accordance with law. Proviso to Section 18(2) spells out a limitation within which the application contemplated under Section 18 of the Act is to be filed. The period of limitation depending on the facts of a given case would be six weeks to six months. Six months being the outer case limit, in either of the events, where the Applicant was present before the Collector at the time when the Award was made or where he was served with a notice under sub-section (2) of Section 12 of the Act.

The provisions of the Code are procedural in nature, while the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act are statutory and binding. The Land Acquisition Act is a special enactment intended to prescribe procedure and is a Code in itself particularly in relation to the proceedings taken under Part-II of the Act and the Collector upon making a Reference under Section 18 of the Act, loses its control and jurisdiction over such proceedings.  The law of amendment which will enable a party to amend the Memorandum of Appeal could normally relate to certain circumstances, like potential, location of the acquired land or reference to certain transactions which for bona fide reasons and despite due diligence could not be placed before the Court. In law, it would be difficult to hold that a Reference Petition which has been filed before the Collector within time can be amended in relation to quantum and can be altered after the prescribed period of limitation is over. Section 18(2) of the Act prohibits certain dealings and proceedings after expiry of the prescribed period and what cannot be achieved directly can also not be achieved indirectly by adopting recourse to the procedural law.  Thus provisions of Order 6, Rule 17 read with Order 41, Rule 33 of the Code of Civil Procedure cannot be resorted to amend the application filed by the claimants under section 18 of the Land Acquisition Act in so far as it relates to enhancement of the amount of compensation claimed. However, the provisions of amendment under the Code can be invoked in amending the memorandum of appeal or a petition before the reference court in so far as it relates to other matters pertaining to pleading and/or evidence, e.g. location, potential of the acquired land, sale instances which would benefit the applicants to justify the amount claimed under Section 18 and which could not be brought before the Court by them despite due diligence. In other words, amendment of memorandum of appeal should be understood in distinction to amendment of an application filed before the Collector under Section 18 of the Act.  [Para 33,34,44]"

However, even if the Claimants, despite exercise of due diligence, are not able to make an appropriate claim for determination of market value of the land as on the date of issuance of section 4 notification, in response to notice under section 9 of the Act, still after amendment of the provisions of section 25 of the Act, they can raise the claim for a higher amount in an application under section 18 of the Act. These provisions require the applicants to submit their objections and grounds, interalia, for inadequacy of the compensation awarded to the claimants and claim such other amount as they deem fit and proper. The legislative intent appears to be that there should be appropriate and expeditious disposal of land references. The scheme of the Act does not contemplate amendment of section 18 petition at a subsequent stage. In view of the legislative protection provided, there is hardly any prejudice being caused to an applicant-claimant if amendment to Petition is denied as it is the duty of every interested person to act diligently and in accordance with law.  On the contrary, if Petition under Section 18 is permitted to be amended at a late stage, it is likely to result in prejudice to the State or the acquiring authority. They will hardly be in a position to defend prayer for enhancement and the matter would have to be remanded to the court of reference which again would result in delay of conclusion of proceedings and lastly such an approach does not appear to be permissible under the provisions of the Act. \t\t\t\t\t        [Para 40,41]"

It would depend upon the facts of each case.\n\nIn respect of agricultural land or undeveloped land which has potential value for housing or commercial purposes, normally 1/3rd amount of compensation has to be deducted out of the amount of compensation payable on the acquired land subject to certain variations depending on its nature, location, extent of expenditure involved for development and the area required for roads and other civic amenities to develop the land so as to make the plots for residential or commercial purposes. A land may be plain or uneven, the soil of the land may be soft or hard bearing on the foundation for the purpose of making construction; may be the land is situated in the midst of a developed area all around but that land may have a hillock or may be low-lying or may be having deep ditches. So the amount of expenses that may be incurred in developing the area also varies. A claimant who claims that his land is fully developed and nothing more is required to be done for developmental purposes, must show on the basis of evidence that it is such a land and it is so located. In the absence of such evidence, merely saying that the area adjoining his land is a developed area, is not enough particularly when the extent of the acquired land is large and even if a small portion of the land is abutting the main road in the developed area, does not give the land the character of a developed area. In 84 acres of land acquired even if one portion on one side abuts the main road, the remaining large area where planned development is required, needs laying of internal roads, drainage, sewer, water, electricity lines, providing civil amenities etc. However, in cases of some land where there are certain advantages by virtue of the developed area around, it may help in reducing the percentage of cut to be applied, as the developmental charges required may be less on that account. There may be various factual factors which may have to be taken into consideration while applying the cut in payment of compensation towards developmental charges, maybe in some cases it is more than 1/3rd and in some cases less than 1/3rd. It must be remembered that there is difference between a developed area and an area having potential value, which is yet to be developed. The fact that an area is developed or adjacent to a developed area will not ipso facto make every land situated in the area also developed to be valued as a building site or plot, particularly, when vast tracts are acquired, as in this case, for development purpose. 2003(1) ALL MR 755 (S.C.), 2004(10) SCC 745, 2004(12) SCC 425 Ref. to.\t\t [Para 21,22]"

                "description": "Interest - Possession taken before issuance of notification under S.4(1) - Interest for period anterior to publication of notification under S.4(1) - Cannot be awarded - Possession taken prior to issuance of S.4(1) notification is de hors the Act - Land owner is entitled to rent/damages for period Govt. retains possession of property. AIR 1995 SC 762 Rel. on. AIR 1995 SC 2492 Overruled.\n\nIn order to decide the question whether the provisions of S.34 of the Act regarding payment of interest would be applicable to a case where possession has been taken over prior to issuance of Notification under S.4(1) of the Act it is necessary to have a look at the Scheme of the Land Acquisition Act. Acquisition means taking not by voluntary agreement but by authority of an Act of Parliament and by virtue of the compulsory powers thereby conferred. In case of acquisition the property is taken by the State permanently and the title to the property vests in the State. The Land Acquisition Act makes complete provision for acquiring title over the land, taking possession thereof and for payment of compensation to the land owner. [Para 11]\n\nThe scheme of the Act does not contemplate taking over of possession prior to the issuance of Notification under S.4(1) of the Act and if possession is taken prior to the said Notification it will be dehors the Act. It is for this reason that both Ss.11(1) and 23(1) enjoin the determination of the market value of the land on the date of publication of Notification under S.4(1) of the Act for the purpose of determining the amount of compensation to be awarded for the land acquired under the Act. These provisions show in unmistakable terms that publication of Notification under S.4(1) is the sine qua non for any proceedings under the Act.  [Para 11]\n\nThe expression \"the Collector shall pay the amount awarded with interest thereon at the rate of nine per centum per annum from the time of so taking possession until it shall have been so paid or deposited\" should not be read in isolation divorced from its context. The words \"such possession\" and \"so taking possession\" are important and have to be given meaning in the light of other provisions of the Act. \"Such compensation\" would mean the compensation determined in accordance with other provisions of the Act, namely, Ss.11 and 15 of the Act which by virtue of S.23(1) mean market value of the land on the date of Notification under S.4(1) and other amounts like statutory sum under sub-section (1-A) and solatium under sub-section (2) of S.23. The heading of Part II of the Act is acquisition and there is a sub-heading \"Taking Possession\" which contains Ss.16 and 17 of the Act. The words \"so taking possession\" would therefore mean taking possession in accordance with S.16 or 17 of the Act. These are the only two sections in the Act which specifically deal with the subject of taking possession of the acquired land. Clearly the stage for taking possession under the aforesaid provisions would be reached only after publication of the Notification under Ss.4(1) and 9(1) of the Act. If possession is taken prior to the issuance of the Notification under S.4(1) it would not be in accordance with S.16 or 17 and will be without any authority of law and consequently cannot be recognised for the purposes of the Act. For the parity of reasons the words \"from the date on which he took possession of the land\" occurring in S.28 of the Act would also mean lawful taking of possession in accordance with S.16 or 17 of the Act. The words \"so taking possession\" can under no circumstances mean such dispossession of the owner of the land which has been done prior to publication of Notification under S.4(1) of the Act which is dehors the provisions of the Act.  [Para 12]\n\nIn a case where the land owner is dispossessed prior to the issuance of preliminary Notification under S.4(1) of the Act the Government merely takes possession of the land but the title thereof continues to vest with the land owner. It is fully open for the land owner to recover the possession of his land by taking appropriate legal proceedings. He is therefore only entitled to get rent or damages for use and occupation for the period the Government retains possession of the property. Where possession is taken prior to the issuance of the preliminary Notification, in our opinion, it will be just and equitable that the Collector may also determine the rent or damages for use of the property to which the land owner is entitled while determining the compensation amount payable to the land owner for the acquisition of the property. The provision of S.48 of the Act lends support to such a course of action. For delayed payment of such amount appropriate interest at prevailing bank rate may be awarded. [Para 18]"

Comparable Sales Method is the most favoured method and such sale deeds must have taken place at a time proximate to the date of publication of preliminary Notification under Section 4(1) of the Act; land sold under the sale must be similar to the acquired land and the land sold under the sale must be in the vicinity of the acquired land, besides the said sales being genuine.  The location, size, shape, tenure, user or potentiality of land under comparable sale have to be taken into account while determining the compensation.  The same principles would apply in respect of Awards of the Courts.\n\nWhere the earlier awards based on sale deeds had been passed 4 to 5 years prior to the acquisition of the land in the case under consideration and besides that, in the said Awards, the land acquired was in the heart of city and could, in no manner, be said to be comparable with the acquired land, which is at a distance of about 2 Kms. from city, those awards could not be relied upon for determining the market value of the acquired land under consideration.  However the awards of the lands which were situated at about 1 to 3 Kms. from city and which were acquired for the same purpose for which the land under consideration was acquired, could be relied upon for determining the market value of the acquired land.  Though the trial Court had adopted method of average, but the said method was adopted by the Court in order to re-assure itself that the price which was arrived at on the basis of comparable Award could be fully justified.  The trial Court had come to the conclusion that the rate of the acquired land could be fixed at Rs.35/- per sq. metre based upon comparable Award which was not only in proximity with reference to the time of Notification, but also with reference to the distance.  However, in view of the fact that close to the acquired land modern facilities like electricity, school etc. were available.  The enhancement of rate by Rs.5/- by Reference Court was proper.  [Para 8,11,15]\n\nHeld further that compensation awarded in instant case by the Reference Court in relation to construction of fencing, well, trees, as well as compensation on the ground of severance was reasonable, and just.

The declaration under Section 6  is conclusive proof with respect to requirement of the land for public purposes. The petitioners have failed to dislodge this presumption either on the ground of mala fide or on the ground of excessive acquisition.  [Para 30]\n\nIn the instant case, what has happened is that the agency which was constructing Bachat Bhavan, is changed. Obviously, the State Government, through Collector, and other Departments of the State Government, were constructing the building of Bachat Bhavan which consisted of auditorium, art gallery, etc. Then it was decided that the entire project be handed over to the Municipal Corporation and accordingly the entire project was handed over to the Municipal Corporation. But the funds provided for construction came from the incentive granted to the Municipal Corporation as per the scheme under \"Small Savings\". Particular portion of the incentive which was to be given to the Municipal Corporation, as per the rules, was given to the Municipal Corporation and that was used for the construction of \"Shri Sant Eknath Rangmandeer\". So, \"Shri Sant Eknath Rangmandeer\" has come up from the cash incentive received in the scheme under the \"Small Savings\" and, therefore, it continues to be Bachat Bhavan. It is not any different project undertaken by the Municipal Corporation. In such circumstances, if the two plots of the petitioners are being acquired for providing compound to Bachat Bhavan, which is subsequently known as \"Shri Sant Eknath Rangmandeer\", it cannot be said that the purpose is changed. The purpose continues to be the same that of providing open space around Bachat Bhavan @ Shri Sant Eknath Rangmandeer.  [Para 33,34]\n\nFurther, who actually constructed Bachat Bhavan is immaterial. Whether the State has constructed Bachat Bhavan or the Municipal Corporation has constructed Bachat Bhavan, the purpose for acquisition of the two plots is providing additional open space for Bachat Bhavan and that is continued. So, it cannot be said that, in this case, the purpose for acquisition is changed prior to passing of award under Section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act and, therefore, the acquisition becomes void.

First is the notification under Section 4(1) of the Act which states that the particular land is needed or is likely needed for public purpose and, therefore, there is the proposal of acquisition of the land. Thereafter the objections are called from the interested persons and the objections are considered as per the provisions of Section 5A of the Act and then there is the declaration regarding public purpose for acquisition of the land as per the provisions of Sub-Section 1 of Section 6 of the Act. All these steps are to be complied with and thereafter publication of the declaration is to be made as per the provisions of Sub-Section 2 of Section 6 of the Act. The notification under Sub-Section 2 of section 6 of the Act serves only as evidence of declaration and it also has to be taken into consideration for the purpose of provisions of Section 11A of the Act to find out whether the final award under Section 11 of the Land Acquisition Act is made within a period of two years from the date of publication of declaration.  [Para 46]\n\nThe wording used in Sub-Section 1 and Sub-Section 2 of Section 6 of the Act, to the effect \"last of any such notification\" is meant to make up leeway for the authorities, so that, the maximum time can be made available for the authorities to make a declaration under Sub-Section 1 of Section 6, after the publication of notification under Section 4(1); and similarly, maximum time could be available to the authorities to pass the final award under Section 11, by remaining within the limits of Section 11A. Because of the provision of Sub-Section 2 of Section 6, that last of such notification would be considered for the proceedings thereafter taken in the acquisition of the land. If the Legislature intended that Sub-Section 2 of Section 6 should regulate the provisions of Sub-Section 1 of Section 6 with respect to declaration of the public purpose, then, in ordinary course, the wording would have been, \"first of such publication of declaration would be relevant\". The intention of the Legislature appears to be to give maximum time to the authorities to take the appropriate decisions. In both Sub-Sections 1 and 2 of Section 6, the last notification is considered relevant, and from this point of view, the argument advanced by the learned Assistant Government Pleader appears correct. Thus, if the declaration is made within a period of one year from the publication of notification under Section 4(1) of the Act, then merely because that declaration is published after the expiry of the period of one year, from the date of notification under Section 4(1) the acquisition will not be void and it cannot be quashed.

It is necessasry insulate genuinely urgent projects from lapsing and not to annihilate the constitutional rights of the individual from the might of the State even though it transgresses essence of the statute.

Firstly, the Section is attracted even though an Award has not been made which, it appears to us, clearly indicates that the completion of this exercise has not been obliterated or dispensed with but has been merely deferred. An unambiguous and unequivocal statement could have been made excluding the requirement of publishing an Award. Secondly, it is available only on the expiration of fifteen days from the issuance of the Section 9 notice. This hiatus of fifteen days must be honoured as its purpose appears to be to enable the affected or aggrieved parties to seek appropriate remedy before they are divested of the possession and the title over their land. The Government shall perforce have to invite and then consider Objections preferred under Section 5A, which procedure as painstakingly and steadfastly observed by this Court constitutes the Constitutional right to property of every citizen; inasmuch as Section 17(4) enables the obliteration of this valuable right, this Court has repeatedly restated that valid and pressing reasons must be present to justify the invocation of these provisions by the Government. Thirdly, possession of the land can be taken only if it is needed for public purpose, which term stands defined in the preceding Section 3(f). A conjoint reading of Sections 17 and 3(f) makes it apparent to us that urgency provisions cannot be pressed into service or resorted to if the acquisition of land is for Companies; however we must be quick to add that this question does not arise before us. Fourthly, possession of such lands would vest in the Government only when the foregoing factors have been formally and strictly complied with. This Section enables the curtailment of a citizen's Constitutional right to property and can be resorted to only if the provisions and preconditions are punctiliously and meticulously adhered to, lest the vesting be struck down and set aside by the Court in its writ jurisdiction.

It requires the Collector to tender payment of eighty per cent of the compensation estimated by him, obviously and pointedly, to the person interested in compensation for such land, unless the Collector is precluded or prevented from making such payments because of exigencies enumerated in Section 31 of the L.A. Act. In other words, the Collector cannot by way of first recourse deposit the estimated compensation even in the Court to which the filing of a Reference under Section 18 is provided. The use of the word \"shall\" indicates that the provisions are prima facie mandatory in nature unless the statute or the language employed in the Section indicates otherwise. The language of sub-Section (3A), inasmuch as it commences with the words \"Before taking possession of any land.....\", makes it incontrovertibly clear that what follows are the prerequisities thereto. It is beyond cavil, therefore, that the statute has ordained a precise and particular methodology which must be adhered to as a precursor to divesting the owner of land of its possession and title. It is axiomatic that if a statute prescribes the manner in which an action is to be performed, it must be carried out strictly in consonance thereto or not at all.      [Para 14]"

The Courts have also taken recourse to assessing the value of the lands for the purposes of compensation on a uniform rate in respect of the lands acquired, making a special concession in respect of the lands which are close to the roads and National Highways where a certain amount of development had already taken place. \t    [Para 34]"

In fact, whilst disposing of the writ petition challenging acquisition, Court did not find favour with contentions of Appellants that notification under S. 6 of said Act was visited. Claim of damages put forward by Appellants is not on ground that Collector had refused to adjudicate upon claim put forward by Appellants. It is not contention of Appellants that at time when such claims could be raised in terms of provisions of Land Acquisition Act, such damages were not foreseen at that time. In case Appellants were aggrieved with compensation which was offered in Award of Land Acquisition Officer under S. 11 of said Act, it was incumbent upon them to seek reference in terms of Act within time prescribed therein and not file suit for these reliefs. Claim for compensation in suit are matters which come within purview of said Act which Appellants could have raised interims of provisions of Land Acquisition Act and as such there is no question of filing suit to claim such reliefs. When Act provides a complete mechanism and create specific forum for determination of amount payable as compensation, jurisdiction of Civil Court is impliedly ousted. When jurisdiction has been conferred upon Courts as provided under said Land Acquisition Act, such jurisdiction is exclusive. Act creates special jurisdiction and provides special remedy to claim compensation and as such it would not be reasonable to hold, when Legislature having provided special remedy under Land Acquisition Act , that such remedy is optional for parties either to apply for reference under S. 18 or to institute as suit in ordinary Court. Hence in order that Court can exercise its jurisdiction to determine compensation, such jurisdiction can be exercised only on basis of reference under S. 18 of said Act made by Collector and not by suit. Finding that reliefs sought by Appellants were not maintainable in Civil Suit, held proper.\n\nAIR 1995 SC 1955, 1997 (11) SCC 250 Rel. on. \t\t\t\t     [Para 10]"

They must observe following principles in discharge of statutory duties :-\n\n(i) The rule of audi alteram partem engrained in the scheme of Section 5A of the Act ensures that before depriving any person of his land by compulsory acquisition, an effective opportunity must be given to him to contest the decision taken by the State Government / competent authority to acquire the particular parcel of land.\n\n(ii) Any person interested in the land, which has been notified under Section 4(1) of the Act, can file objections under Section 5A(1) and show that the purpose specified in the notification is really not a public purpose or that in the guise of acquiring the land for a public purpose the appropriate Government wants to confer benefit upon private persons or that the decision of the appropriate Government is arbitrary or is vitiated due to mala fides.\n\n(iii) In response to the notice issued by the Land Acquisition Collector under Section 5A(2) of the Act, the objector can make all possible endeavours to convince the Land Acquisition Collector that the acquisition is not for a public purpose specified in the notification issued under Section 4(1); that his land is not suitable for the particular purpose; that other more suitable parcels of land are available, which can be utilized for execution of the particular project or scheme.\n\n(iv) The Land Acquisition Collector is duty bound to objectively consider the arguments advanced by the objector and make recommendations, duly supported by brief reasons, as to why the particular piece of land should or should not be acquired and whether the plea put forward by the objector merits acceptance. In other words, the recommendations made by the Land Acquisition Collector should reflect objective application of mind to the entire record including the objections filed by the interested persons.\n\n(v)The Land Acquisition Collector is required to submit his report and the recommendations to the State Government along with the record of proceedings to enable the latter to take final call on the desirability, propriety and justification for the acquisition of the particular parcel(s) of land.\n\n(vi) The declaration under Section 6(1) of the Act can be issued only if the appropriate Government, on an objective application of mind to the objections filed by the interested persons including the landowners and the report of the Land Acquisition Collector, is satisfied that the land is needed for the particular purpose specified in the notification issued under Section 4(1) of the Act.\n\n2012(1) ALL MR 905 (S.C.), 2012 ALL SCR 370, (2013) 1 SCC 403, 2013 ALL SCR 1689 Rel. on.

Public purpose includes a purpose involving general interest of community as opposed to the interest of an individual directly or indirectly involved. Individual interest must give way to public interest as far as public purpose in respect of acquisition of land is concerned.\n\nPrima facie, State is the first Judge to determine whether there exists public purpose or not. But the decision of the State is not beyond judicial scrutiny. The Courts have the jurisdiction and it is their duty to determine the matter whenever a question is raised whether a requisition order is or is not for a public purpose While determining the question whether a requisition order is or is not for a public purpose, the facts and circumstances in each case are to be closely examined in order to determine whether a public purpose has been established. The requirement of land for residential and commercial purposes and for development of the Sector involves in it an element of general interest of the community and whatever furthers the general interest must be regarded as a 'public purpose' as opposed to the particular interest of individuals. \n\n2006(6) ALL MR 97 (S.C.), 2009 ALL SCR 731 Rel.on. \t\t     [Para 9,11,12]"

It would not be right to contend that because the land was already released, it cannot be acquired by subsequent notification. If it is to be held that land already released cannot be reacquired, an anomalous situation may arise that the land cannot be acquired for all time to come even if it is genuinely required. It is not in dispute that the earlier notification is issued by the State for the development of the land for residential and commercial purposes which is same purpose for subsequent acquisition as well.

                "description": "Manual of Land Acquisition for State of Maharashtra (1918), Para 328 - Govt. Resolutions dtd. 10.10.73 and 19.8.74 - Acquisition of Non-agricultural land for VRCE - Surplus lands surrended to Govt. by VRCE - Govt. planning to allot such lands to construct building for central and its own Departments - Application by owner for release of such lands - Order of Revenue Minister to restore lands in favour of land owner is contrary to Govt. resolutions and is without jurisdiction.\n\nOnce the land is acquired and the possession of the acquired land is taken over by the government and Award is passed, the acquired land completely vests in the Government without any encumbrance in view of S. 16.  In the instant case, after issuance of the Notification under sections 4 and 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, the possession of the disputed land was taken over by the Collector in exercise of his power under section 11 of the said Act and consequently the disputed land had vested absolutely in the Government free from all encumbrances.  [Para 10]\n\nPara of the Manual of the Land Acquisition of the State of Maharashtra deals with the disposal of the surplus land.  It says that where any acquired land becomes available for disposal by the State Government, it need not necessarily be restored to the person from whom it was originally acquired unless the person concerned is a landless person or is in receipt of income not exceeding Rs.1000/- p.m. from other sources, in which case the land could be restored to such landless person.  It further says that such excess land, if not granted to the original occupants, should be disposed in accordance with the Standing Orders of the Government regarding disposal of the Government waste lands but on payment of price etc..  This particular paragraph further makes it clear that the surplus land referred to is only the agricultural land and it did not apply to the nonagricultural land or the land having nonagricultural potentiality.  [Para 11]\n\nFrom the Govt. Resolution it was a clear policy of the Government that the lands which were nonagricultural lands at the time of its acquisition or which gained nonagricultural potentiality after acquisition, were not covered by the Government Resolution dtd.10.10.73.  The land owner's predecessor who held the land at the time of acquisition, himself had made an application for conversion of the said land for nonagricultural purpose.  It is apparently clear that subsequent thereto the land having been included in the City of Nagpur, it was shown in the Development Plan of Nagpur City and shown having been reserved for being used for the public offices as also for commercial use.  It was, therefore, apparently clear from the record that the land had nonagricultural potentiality from the date of its acquisition.  It was also clear that the land was not capable  of being used for agriculture as it was a vacant land within the meaning of Land Ceiling Act, 1976 and also because it was included in the agglomeration of City of Nagpur.  [Para 13]\n\nNo doubt the Revenue Minister had to pass an order on review petition in terms of mandate issued by the High Court to decide matter on basis of earlier writ petitions but it was incumbent on the Hon'ble Revenue Minister to consider the Government Resolution itself and also the fact whether the disputed land did have or not the nonagricultural potentiality before deciding to restore the same.  He, however, committed total error, irregularity and non-application of mind in ordering restoration which was obviously in violation of the Government Policy.  Order was, therefore, without jurisdiction which was not available in view of the government Resolution.  The order could not be sustained.  [Para 17,18,19]"

However, the section has been construed to exclude the owner's right to be heard before the acquisition is withdrawn. This is because the owner's grievances are redressable under Section 48(2). But as far as the beneficiary of the acquisition is concerned there is no similar statutory provision. In contrast with the owner's position the beneficiary of the acquisition may by withdrawal from the acquisition suffer substantial loss without redress particularly when it may have deposited compensation money towards the cost of the acquisition and the steps for acquisition under the Act have substantially been proceeded with. An opportunity of being heard may allow the beneficiary not only to counter the basis for withdrawal, but also, if the circumstances permitted, to cure any defect or shortcoming and fill any lacuna.\t\t\t [Para 32]"

But the Parliament having enacted Section 28-A, as a beneficial provision, it would cause great injustice if a literal interpretation is given to the expression \"had not made an application to the Collector under Section 18\" in Section 28-A of the Act.  The aforesaid expression would mean that if the land-owner has made an application for reference under Section 18 and that reference is entertained and answered.  In other words, it may not be permissible for a land owner to make a reference and get it answered and then subsequently make another application when some other person gets the reference answered and obtains a higher amount.  When an application under Section 18 is not entertained on the ground of limitation, the same not fructifying into any reference, then that would not tantamount to an effective application and consequently the rights of such applicant emanating from some other reference being answered to move an application under Section 28-A cannot be denied.

Whereas the land acquisition officer admittedly based its award on the basis of two sale instances, placed on the record.  Out of those two sale instances one sale instance was rejected by the Land Acquisition Officer, himself. The learned Advocate appearing for the respondents pointed out that the remaining one sale instance was not comparable with the land under acquisition, as admittedly the same was of land under Group C. There were no comparable sales in the village Banayat, for the purpose of land under acquisition of Group A and B. The Land Acquisition Officer, therefore, took those sale instances of Group C, into consideration while awarding the compensation, having Rs.2/- per hector as the rate of assessment.  The learned Advocate appearing for the respondents pointed from the award itself, the rate of assessment per hector of the respective lands, which shows that the rate of assessment per hector of the lands in question are 3 to 3.13. Therefore, considering these rates of assessment itself, on the face of record, the land acquisition officer had awarded less compensation. The law is settled that the parties or person or land owners are entitled for the maximum compensation for its lands, subject to other condition must be on higher side. The learned Judge, therefore, rightly relied on the sale instances and material placed on the record by the land owners, as referred in para no.23 of the impugned judgment. Those sale instances even though were not of relevant or immediate period from the date of notification in question, still those sale deeds cannot be overlooked by the Land Acquisition Officer, especially when there is no dispute that no sale instances were available of the village Banayat and, specially of Group A and B, as observed above. The learned Advocate appearing for the respondents therefore, relied on Chinda Vithal Sonone (Supra) (Bom. High Court), wherein after considering the material on record as well as the existing provisions of the law, read with Sections 23 and 24 of the Act, and based on the earlier decisions, our High Court, has expressed in Assistant Development Officer, Trombay Vs. Tayaballi Bohori (supra), permitted to take into consideration such sale instances.  In the facts and circumstances of the case like this, where admittedly there were no sale instances available for the relevant land or related area, in such circumstances, the sale instances available on the record cannot be discarded. For proper assessment it is necessary to look into those sale instances and material on the record, to award compensation to the land owners.  In the present case, admittedly, those sale instances were placed on the record along with the evidence of three witnesses in support of the same, therefore, those sale instances as well as material cannot be overlooked. 1933(35) BLR 763 - Rel on.

[Para 4]\n\nThe reference in instant case expressly refers to the question of apportionment.  Even the application for reference refers to the question of apportionment.  However the claimant submitted that the question of considering of his title to the acquired property does not arise in the present reference.  After reciting the entries in the revenue records, the Special Land Acquisition Officer (S.L.A.O.) has observed in his order that the claimant's claim of exclusive ownership cannot be accepted as in the record of rights produced by him, his name appears as person having \"Other rights\" and in the record of rights name of another person appears as \"Holder\".  Thus, read in context, it cannot be said that the S.L.A.O. accepted the claimant's title in the award.  This is further clear when in the operative part of the order the S.L.A.O. declared certain sum as due to the claimant and \"heirs of deceased holder\".  Had the S.L.A.O. accepted the claimant's title to the exclusion of all others, he would not have passed the award in the above terms.  It is true that the proportion of appointment between the holder and the claimant were not specified.  However, the S.L.A.O. informed the claimant that the compensation would be payable to him \"on production of document in proof of your title to the land under reference....\"  This therefore clearly establishes that the S.L.A.O. did not accept the claimant to be the true owner, much less the exclusive owner of the said property.  The question of title has been kept expressly open by the S.L.A.O..  He has also not rejected the claimant's claim to property.  Therefore, it is not necessary at this stage for the Court to decide the question of title for the same has in fact not been referred to the Court under this reference under section 18.

                "description": "Reference under - Reference under two sections operate in different fields - Remedy of reference under S.18 is available only to a 'person interested - S.30 remedy is available to person gaining title to land after passing of award - Thus viewed Ss.18 and 30 do not overlap.\n\nThe scheme of the Act reveals that the remedy of reference u/S. 18 is intended to be available only to a 'person interested'. A person present either personally or through representative or on whom a notice is served u/S. 12(2) is obliged, subject to his specifying the test as to locus, to apply to the Collector within the time prescribed u/S. 18(2) to make a reference to the Court. The basis of title on which the reference would be sought for u/S. 18 would obviously be a pre-existing title by reference to the date of the award. So is Section 29, which speaks of 'persons interested'. Finality to the award spoken of by Section 12(1) of the Act is between the Collector on one hand and the 'persons interested' on the other hand and attaches to the issues relating to (i) the true area, i.e. measurement of the land, (ii) the value of the land, i.e. the quantum of compensation, and (iii) apportionment of the compensation among the 'persons interested'. The 'persons interested' would be bound by the award without regard to the fact whether they have respectively appeared before the Collector or not. The finality to the award spoken of by Section 29 is as between the 'persons interested' inter se and is confined to the issue as to the correctness of the apportionment. Section 30 is not confined in its operation only to 'persons interested'. It would, therefore, be available for being invoked by the 'persons interested' if they were neither present nor represented in proceedings before the Collector, nor were served with notice u/S. 12(2) of the Act or when they claim on the basis of a title coming into existence post award. The definition of 'persons interested' speaks of 'an interest in compensation to be made'. An interest coming into existence post award gives rise to a claim in compensation which has already been determined. Such a person can also have recourse to Section 30. In any case, the dispute for which Section 30 can be invoked shall remain confined only (i) as to the apportionment of the amount of compensation or any part thereof, or (ii) as to the persons to whom the amount of compensation (already determined) or any part thereof is payable. The State claiming on the basis of a pre-existing right would not be a 'person interested', as already pointed out hereinabove and on account of his right being pre-existing, the State, in such a case, would not be entitled to invoke either Section 18 or Section 30 seeking determination of its alleged pre-existing right. A right accrued or devolved post award may be determined in a reference u/S. 30 depending on Collector's discretion to show indulgence, without any bar as to limitation. Alternatively, such a right may be left open by the Collector to be adjudicated upon in any independent legal proceedings. This view is just, sound, and logical as a title post award could not have been canvassed up to the date of the award and should also not be left without remedy by denying access to Section 30. Viewed from this angle, Sections 18 and 30 would not overlap and would have fields to operate independent of each other.\t [Para 30]"

The Collector holds the proceedings and makes an award as a representative of the State Government. Land or an interest in land pre-owned by State cannot be subject-matter of acquisition by State. The question of deciding the ownership of State or holding of any interest by the State Government in proceedings before the Collector cannot arise in proceedings before the Collector (as defined in Section 3(c) of the Act). If it was a government land there was no question of initiating the proceedings for acquisition at all. The Government would not acquire the land, which already vests in it. A dispute as to pre-existing right or interest of the State Government in the property sought to be acquired is not a dispute capable of being adjudicated upon or referred to the Civil Court for determination either under Section 18 or Section 30 of the Act. The reference made by the Collector to the Court was wholly without jurisdiction and the Civil Court ought to have refused to entertain the reference and ought to have rejected the same. All the proceedings under Section 30 of the Act beginning from the reference and adjudication thereon by the Civil Court suffer from lack of inherent jurisdiction and are therefore a nullity liable to be declared so.\t [Para 40]\n\nHowever, the quashing of the proceedings under Section 30 of the Land Acquisition Act would not debar the State from pursuing such other legal remedy before such other forum as may be available to the State Government.\t [Para 41]"

The lands were acquired for public purpose viz. for Mukane dam which was of great importance and utility to the public at large. Thus, it was expected of the Reference Court to make certain deduction while computing the compensation payable to the Claimants considering the fact that the sale deed Exhibit-42 was in respect of a small piece of land. In the facts and circumstances of the case and keeping in mind the location and potential of the land, it would be just, fair and reasonable to apply deduction at the rate of at least 25 per cent.

Landowners and said expert, ought to have produced relevant basic data, so as to enable the trial Court and thereafter, High Court to understand the nature of exercise undertaken by him and to verify it. He does not disclose search made by him to find out age of construction and he remains satisfied with accepting year of purchase as year of construction. He has not given any data to show the contemporary rates of construction then prevalent in that area. He does not find it necessary to refer to CSR rates or any material gathered by him for arriving at his rates. Thus he refuses to supply anything to enable State to cross check his claim or to Court to evaluate it. In ultimate analysis, one has to only accept his word or his experience to support that word. He includes structures without plinth and also values first floor at wrong rates. If the Courts were to accept such statements of witnesses as true merely because they are not subjected to cross-examination or effective cross-examination or because evidence in rebuttal thereof has not been adduced, it would amount to doling out public money to the claimants far in excess of their legitimate entitlement for just compensation payable for their lands. If such situation is prevented by courts dealing with claims for compensation by testing the statements of witnesses for claimants on the basis of probabilities, the Courts will have performed the duty justly expected of them. Hence, no Court which tests the oral evidence of the claimants on the touch-stone of probabilities calling into aid, its experience of life, men and matters and find such evidence to be untrustworthy, the same cannot be found fault with. \t\t       [Para 47,48]"

Once the claimant satisfies the Reference Court that the compensation awarded by the Land Acquisition Officer is inadequate, the Reference Court proceeds to determine the compensation, with reference to the principles in section 23 of the Act. As the Act does not require the person aggrieved/landowner to specify the amount of compensation sought, when objecting to the amount of compensation and seeking a reference, mentioning of the amount of compensation sought is optional. As there is no obligation to specify the amount in the application for reference, it can be specified in the claim statement filed before the Reference Court. The period of limitation in section 18 of the Act has nothing to do with specifying the amount of compensation claimed. It therefore follows that if the reference is in regard to objection to the amount of compensation, the Reference Court can permit any application for amendment of the claim relating to compensation. This requirement under the Court Fees Act cannot be read as a requirement under the Land Acquisition Act. So long as Land Acquisition Act is not amended to require the person aggrieved to specify the amount of compensation claimed by him in the reference application, the bar of limitation will not apply even if the amount is specified in the application for reference and subsequently a higher amount is sought by way of amendment. \t\t\t\t\t\t         [Para 13,19]"

It is said that one swallow does not make a summer.  Based only on one Sale Deed it was not possible to jump to the conclusion that there was increase in market price of land at the rate of Rs.9.85 per sq.m. per month.  Admittedly neither the buyer nor the seller of the Sale Deed was examined and who was examined was an attesting witness who happened to be the nephew of the buyer of the said plot sold on 7.6.82.  It appears that the plot of said Sale Deed had a river view and possibly on that count the buyers had paid a price which was slightly more than the price paid for the Sale Deed dt.12-11-81.  There could be other reasons as well, but from the very Sale Deed dt.7-6-82 one could not jump to the conclusion that there was price increase to the extent of Rs.9.85 per sq.m. per month in the locality.  No doubt the courts do take a note that there is a general trend in rise of prices but in the case at hand the Sale Deed 12-11-81 was executed just less than three months prior to the date of Notification under Section 4 of the Act and that being so, it was not a case where the respondent ought to have been awarded any price increase.

In the event there is a dispute with regard to the title or apportionment of the amount of compensation, a proper reference has to be made.

Evidently, the State was not interested in a dispute by and between the appellant and the first respondent. Appellant's counsel while taking notice of the application categorically stated that a counter affidavit is required to be filed. Thus an endorsement of 'no objection' made by or on behalf of the counsel for the state could not have been put in use against the appellant by the learned judge. It is also well settled that no amount of consent can confer jurisdiction on a court when it has none. If the court had no jurisdiction, any order passed by it is a nullity.

Relied on.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     [Para 31]\n\nA registered document in terms of Section 51-A of the Act may carry therewith a presumption of genuineness. Such a presumption, therefore, is rebuttable. Raising a presumption, therefore, does not amount to proof, it only shifts the burden of proof against whom the presumption operates for disproving it. Only if the presumption is not rebutted by discharging the burden, the Court may act on the basis of such presumption. Even when in terms of the Evidence Act, a provision has been made that the Court shall presume a fact, the same by itself would not be irrebuttable or conclusive. The genuineness of a transaction can always fall for adjudication, if any question is raised in this behalf.   [Para 35]\n\nSection 51-A of the L.A. Act may be read literally and having regard to the ordinary meaning which can be attributed to the term 'acceptance of evidence' relating to transaction evidenced by a sale deed, its admissibility in evidence would be beyond any question. We are not oblivious of the fact that only by bringing a documentary evidence in the record it is not automatically brought on the record. For bringing a documentary evidence on the record, the same must not only be admissible but the contents thereof must be proved in accordance with law. But when the statute enables a Court to accept a sale deed on the records evidencing a transaction, nothing further is required to be done. The admissibility of a certified copy of sale deed by itself could not be held to be inadmissible as thereby a secondary evidence has been brought on record without proving the absence of primary evidence. Even the vendor or vendee thereof is not required to examine themselves for proving the contents thereof. This, however, would not mean that contents of the transaction as evidenced by the registered sale deed would automatically be accepted. The Legislature advisedly has used the word 'may'. A discretion, therefore, has been conferred upon a Court to be exercised judicially, i.e. upon taking into consideration the relevant factors. 1997(6) SCC 41, (1997)10 SCC 128, 1997(6) SCC 54, (1996)10 SCC 751 (1995)4 SCC 136, 1995(2) SCC 305, 1999(3) SCC 240 Overruled.

Firstly market value has to be determined with reference to large tracts of undeveloped agricultural lands in a rural area, whereas the allotment rates of development authorities are with reference to small plots in a developed lay out falling within Urbana. Secondly DDA and other statutory authorities adopt different rates for plots in the same area with reference to the economic capacity of the buyer, making it difficult to ascertain the real market value, whereas market value determination for acquisitions is uniform and does not depend upon the economic status of the land loser. Thirdly in the instant case the Court is concerned with market value of freehold land, whereas the allotment \"rates\" in the DDA Brochure refer to the initial premium payable on allotment of plots on leasehold basis.  \t [Para 3,7]"

S.25 has no relevance in regard to determination of market value as contrasted from award of compensation.

All that section 25 requires is that courts should not award an amount which is less than what is awarded by the Land Acquisition Collector, even if the evidence may show a lesser market value. So, the bar under section 25 of the LA Act is not in regard to determination of a market value, which is less than what was awarded by the LAO. The bar is only upon the reference court (or any higher court) reducing the compensation awarded by the Land Acquisition Collector. The fact that the Land Acquisition Collector has awarded compensation at a particular rate does not mean that the sale deeds which are otherwise reliable, cannot be relied upon to find out what was the real market value.  \t [Para 23]"

If the vendor or vendee was so examined, it was possible to cross-examine them so as to ascertain whether the transaction reflected by the exhibited instrument was a genuine transaction or a transaction showing a depressed value or a boosted value. But with the insertion of section 51A, certified copies of registered sale deeds could be tendered as evidence without examining the vendor or vendee thereof and the court is enabled to accept them as evidence of the transaction recorded therein. Therefore, courts may accept and act upon certified copies of sale deeds exhibited without examining the vendor or vendee. They may not be relied upon if there is other acceptable evidence which throw a doubt about the correctness of the sale price shown therein. Consequently, though a certified copy of a sale deed may be received in evidence and exhibited even without examining the vendor and vendee, and accepted as proof of the transaction to which it relates, the courts have the discretion to rely upon it or reject it as unreliable or unacceptable for reasons to be recorded.  2004(5) ALL MR (S.C.) 1138 - Rel.on.   [Para 26,27]\n\nBut a word of caution. If the acquisition is in regard to a large area of agricultural lands in a village, and the exemplar sale deed is also in respect of an agricultural land in the same village, it may be possible to rely upon the sale deed as prima facie evidence of the prevailing market value, even if such land is at the other end of the village at a distance of one or two kilometres. But the same may not be the position where the acquisition relates to plots in a town or city where every locality or road has a different value. For example in a place like Delhi there are some areas where the plot value is many times more than the value of plots in a neighbouring middle class locality which in turn may be many time more than the value of plot in a neighbouring slum area. Or the price of a property on a main road may be many times more than the price of a property on a parallel smaller road, though the two properties may be situated back to back. It cannot be said that merely because two properties adjoin each other or touch each other the value applicable to the property facing a main road, should be applied to the property to its rear facing a service road. Therefore, while a distance of about a kilometre may not make a difference for purposes of market value in a rural village, even a distance of 50 metre may make a huge difference in market value in urban properties. The distance between the two properties, the nature and situation of the property, proximity to the village or a road and several other factors may all be relevant in determining the market value. Mere production of some exemplar deeds without 'connecting' the subject matter of the instrument, to the acquired lands will be of little assistance in determining the market value. Section 51-A of the LA Act only exempts the production of the original sale deed and examination of the vendor or vendee.  \t [Para 28,29]"

There is no third way of accepting a document, by adding to the market value disclosed by the document, some percentage to off-set the under-valuation. There is no legal basis to proceed on a general assumption that parties, without exception, fail to reflect the true consideration in the sale deeds, that there is always undervaluation or suppression of the true price and that consequently, all sale deeds reflect a depressed value and not the real market value and therefore, some percentage should be added to arrive at the real value. Such a course also amounts to branding all vendors and purchasers as dishonest persons without any evidence and without hearing them. It ignores the fact that government has fixed minimum guideline values and whenever a registering authority is of the view that a sale deed is undervalued, proceedings are initiated for determination of the true market value. It also ignores the fact that a large number of sale deeds are accepted by the registering authorities as disclosing the current market value.  \t [Para 30,31]"

In the present case clause (b) is attracted because the 1st respondent was not present, or represented before the Collector at the time he made his award. Therefore, notice under sub-section (2) of Section 12 was sent to the respondent herein on 27-7-92. It was returned on 29-7-92, said to be after proper service. The evidence on record shows that one Supai Gagrai had put his signatures on the bottom of the notice and received the notice. The name of the respondent herein is Supai Munda. The respondent has denied to have received the notice. It is his say that he is an illiterate person and cannot put his signatures. This will clearly demonstrate that the respondent herein has not received the notice under Section 12(2) of the Act personally. If that is so, the notice upon the respondent was not duly served.  It is undisputed that the Award was made on 25-7-92. The alleged agreement was entered into between the authority and the respondent herein on 6-8-92 and the compensation amount was also paid on 6-8-92. As already noticed the application for reference under Section 18 of the Act was sent by registered post on 17-9-92 and the authority received the same on 18-9-92. Notice under sub-section (2) of Section 12 of the Act was sent on 27-7-92. The High Court has dealt with this question elaborately and arrived at the conclusion that if the period is reckoned from the date of posting of the application i.e. 17-9-92, the application was filed within 42 days of the receipt of payment. It is undisputed that the application was received on 18-9-92. Therefore, there was only one day's delay.   [Para 9,10]"

The proviso deals with two types of situation which provides for different period of limitation depending upon the question whether the notification under section 4(1) was published. Any declaration under section 6 made after the expiry of one year from the date of the publication of the notification under sub-section (1) of section 4 would be void and of no effect. The statutory benefit given under this provision, keeping purport and objects of the provisions of the Act and in particular the proviso which had been inserted by Act 68 of 1984 and which came into force with effect from 24.9.1984, must be given to the owners of land.

Where the waiver is not express it may be implied from conduct which is inconsistent with the continuance of the right. A right can be waived by the party for whose benefit certain requirements or considerations had been provided by a Statute. Though there is absolute bar for waiver of fundamental right, there is no such bar for waiver of any statutory right. In order to constitute waiver, there must be voluntary and intentional relinquishment of a right and the waiver is question of conduct and must necessarily be determined on the facts of each case. There could be no waiver unless the person against whom waiver is claimed had full knowledge of his rights and of facts enabling him to take effectual action for the enforcement of such rights. Thus, in the present case what requires to be seen is as to whether the petitioners stated to have waived their right to challenge notification under section 6 on the ground of limitation and whether they have enjoyed any benefits from such waiver and/or a waiver was an intentional relinquishment of a known right.\n\nThe ground of limitation under sub-section (1) of section 6 was introduced by way of amendment in January, 2008. The petitioners participated in the award making process and thereafter filed reference application under section 18 on 24.12.2007. This conduct of the petitioners, clearly demonstrates that they waived their known statutory right intentionally. Such petitioners cannot be allowed to raise the grounds of challenge in piecemeal to suit their convenience and to delay the acquisition, particularly when there is no dispute that the purpose is public purpose.

Even, otherwise, the appellant has not prayed for framing of the issue and referring it to the competent authority for its decision. No party is asserting any tenancy right before the reference Court and, therefore, there is no question of referring any issue in this behalf. It is required to be noted that ultimately it was the reference Court which was required to determine the just and fair compensation based on the nature of the land and there was ample material on record for coming to the conclusion that the land in question was an agricultural tenanted land. In the instant case, the reference Court was concerned with the fixation of fair market value under the Land Acquisition Act. If the land in question is an agricultural tenanted land, naturally it will always fetch less price as it cannot be put to any other use. If the land is an agricultural land and not tenanted land, the same can be put to any other use, after getting permissions from the authorities. However, tenanted agricultural land is under restriction and it should be used only for the agricultural purpose and not for any other purpose. In the instant case, the revenue entry was in existence since many decades and no attempt was made by the appellant for correcting such entries and due to the said reason the land in question was determined as tenanted agricultural land.\n\nConsidering the aforesaid aspect, no fault can be found with the view taken by the reference Court as the fair market value has to be determined on the basis of the nature of the land. It is required to be noted here that since the present appellant settled the dispute under Section 30(2) of the Land Acquisition Act with the so called objectors, who were allegedly cultivating the lands, by paying them 50 % of the compensation, therefore, naturally there was no question of the cultivators moving the Court for seeking declaration in connection with their tenancy. Simply because the cultivators have not got any declaration, it cannot be said that the nature of the land has changed. In view of overwhelming evidence on record, and considering the fact that the land is a tenanted agricultural land, the market value is fixed. The material available with the learned Reference Court was the entries in the Revenue Record for the purpose of finding out the nature of the land and fixing the appropriate market price. Considering the aforesaid aspect of the material, the Reference Court was duty bound to fix the compensation on the basis of the nature of land and has rightly treated the land in question as an agricultural tenanted land.

Such evidence should not be too general in the nature as the compensation is to be paid to the claimants. No doubt the land of the claimants in such cases is acquired against the will of the claimants, but then the compensation is to be paid from the public exchequer.

The guiding star or the acid test would be whether a hypothetical willing vendor would offer the lands and a willing purchaser in normal human conduct would be willing to buy as a prudent man in normal market conditions prevailing in the open market in the locality in which the acquired lands are situated as on the date of Notification under Section 4(1) of the Act.  [Para 11]\n\nThe market value of the land can be considered either on the basis of comparable sale instances, the income generated from it or on the basis of the valuation made by the experts. In the instant case, admittedly, the land was not under cultivation in the known recent part and it was a barren land even without plantation activity. The mere fact that it was a plateau cannot be a reason to hold that the market value (Rs.10/- per sq. mtr.) fixed by the Land Acquisition Officer was under estimated or was a pittance awarded. The sale instances relied upon by the claimant were of the lands located at a distance beyond 2 kms. and near the market as well as in a developed area. There was no evidence to fix the market value of the subject land on the basis of comparable sale instances. [Para 9]\n\nThe subject land belongs to the claimant/Communidade and, therefore, it is not a free hold land. The land belonging to Communidades could not be utilised for a purpose which will enhance its market value and the restrictions imposed on such land under the Code of Communidades clearly shows that its free use is not permissible. When the land under acquisition suffers statutory restrictions, the obvious consequences that follow is on its market value and, therefore, such land cannot be compared with other sale instances in respect of the free hold land. It is evident that the subject land had no marketability on account of more than one statutory restrictions it suffered.   [Para 9,10]\n\nThus determination of compensation @ Rs.10/- per sq.mtr. was held proper and needed no enhancement.\t [Para 13]"

When large tracts of lands belonging to several land owners are acquired by development authorities for formation of residential or commercial layouts, schemes may be formulated which contemplate 25% to 30% of the land area being used for roads amenities and open spaces, and utilize the remaining area which is developed into plots, by selling about one-third by auction to recover the development cost, by allotting about one-third to poor or needy at cost price, and by releasing/allotting about one-third area to the land losers whose lands were acquired.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 9]"

In other words, if notice issued under section 12(2) in relation to the award passed under section 11 contains information regarding identity and the area of land acquired, the rate of the compensation awarded and the share of the addressee of the notice in the compensation awarded then it could be sufficient compliance of the provisions of section 12(2) of the said Act which would enable the interested person to file objections, if any, under section 18 in case he is dissatisfied on account of any of the factors mentioned in the said provision of law.  For this reason, he need not have copy of the award itself.

[Para 14]\n\nThe generation of a chart by the body at whose behest and for whose benefit the lands are being acquired containing its responses to the objections is an input which must be taken into account by the Collector but it is quite a different thing for the Collector to say that this by itself would constitute the performance of his statutory duty before onward submission to the State Government. That would not meet the requirement of Section 5-A.  [Para 18]"

                "description": "Importance of enquiry under S.5-A - Principles emerging from decided cases stated.\n\n(i) Section 5-A embodies a very just and wholesome principle to the effect that a person whose property is being acquired should have a reasonable opportunity of persuading the authorities that his property should not be acquired. (Munshil Singh Vs. Union of India, AIR 1973 SC 1150);\n\n(ii) The limited right that is conferred upon an owner or a person interested to object to acquisition under Section 5-A is a substantive right and not an empty formality. This right can be taken away for good and sufficient reason within the limitations prescribed by Section 17(4). (Union of India Vs. Mukesh Hans, 2004(5) ALL MR (S.C.) 1170 : AIR 2004 SC 4307);\n\n(iii) An enquiry under Section 5-A has an intrinsic connection with the requirement of fairness under Article 14 of the Constitution. Such an enquiry is, therefore, not merely statutory in nature, but has a constitutional component traceable to Article 14, a component which continues to subsist notwithstanding the deletion of the right to property as a fundamental right. (State of Punjab Vs. Gurdial Singh, AIR 1980 SC 319 and Om Prakash Vs. State of U. P., AIR 1998 SC 2504);\n\n(iv) An opportunity of being heard is necessary for the individual to establish that the purpose for which the acquisition is sought to be made is not a public purpose. In addition thereto, the enquiry under Section 5-A enables the individual to have an opportunity to establish that even if a purpose is a public purpose, the acquisition of his land is not necessary or that in any event even if his land is necessary for a public purpose, the special facts which apply to him justify omitting the land from acquisition. (Delhi Administration Vs. Gurdip Singh Uban, 1999(4) ALL MR 628 (S.C.) : AIR 2000 SC 3737);\n\n(v) When an opportunity of being heard is expressly conferred by statute, the safeguards laid down by the statute must be scrupulously complied with. Sections 4, 5-A and 6 have to be read together. The writ Court cannot refuse to grant relief where there has either been total or substantial non-compliance with the provisions of Section 5-A. (Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Ltd. Vs. Darius Shapur Chenai, AIR 2005 SC 3520);\n\n(vi) Section 6(3) renders a declaration once issued to be conclusive evidence that the land is needed for a public purpose. However, when the decision making process is in question, the power of judicial review can be exercised by the Court on grounds of illegality, irrationality and procedural impropriety. (Hindustan Petroleum Corporation Vs. Darius Shapur Chenai, AIR 2005 SC 3520).\n\n(vii) The eventual decision is required to be taken by the appropriate Government, on objections, under Sub-Section (2) of Section 5-A. The State Government has a wide discretion to accept or to reject the report under Section 5-A or to take an independent decision to continue or discontinue acquisition proceedings in respect of any particular land proposed to be acquired. \"Wide the discretion may be, but not wild\". (BEML Employees House Building Co-op. Society Ltd. Vs. State of Karnataka, 2005(5) ALL MR (S.C.) 39 : (2005)9 SCC 248). The exercise of all statutory discretion must be based on reasonable grounds and cannot lapse into arbitrariness or caprice which is anathema to the rule of law envisaged in Article 14 of the Constitution;\n\n(viii) The State Government has to apply its mind not only to the objections filed by the owner of the land, but also to the report which is submitted by the Collector upon making other and further enquiries and to the recommendations made by him in that behalf. The State Government may further enquire into the matter if a case is made out before it for arriving at its own satisfaction that it is necessary to deprive a citizen of his right to property.

It clearly provides that the compensation which can be awarded in a case where the claim quantified in answer to section 9 notice, shall be under no circumstances beyond the amount so quantified by the claimant, as also it shall not be less than the amount awarded by the Collector under section 11. Proceedings in the case in hand had commenced prior to 24/09/1984, the notification under section 4 having been issued on 13/02/1970 and notice under section 9 having been issued on 02/08/1973. The possession of the land was taken on 21/02/1974 and the award was passed on 27/03/1984. In other words, entire proceedings for the purpose of acquisition of land were concluded prior to enforcement of the Amendment Act 68 of 1984 which came into force from 24/09/1984. Further, it was clearly revealed to the Reference Court that the claimant had quantified its claim for compensation in answer to section 9 notice to the extent of Rs.14/- per sq. meter. Considering the mandate of unamended section 25(1) of the said Act, it was, therefore, obligatory for the Reference Court not to award any compensation over and above the amount claimed by the claimant in answer to section 9 notice. Failure on the part of the Reference Court to comply with its obligation to adhere to the statutory fetters imposed on exercise of powers of the Reference Court in the matter of ascertaining the market value of the acquired land clearly renders the impugned award granting compensation over and above the land which was claimed by the claimant in answer to section 9 notice to be bad-in-law. It being contrary to the statutory provisions, the State is justified in challenging the same irrespective of the fact that no issue on that count was framed.   [Para 9,10]"

Therefore, scheme of the Act is such that it does not cause any prejudicial consequence in case the notice under Section 9(3) is not served upon the person interested. While determining whether a provision is mandatory or directory, in addition to the language used therein, the Court has to examine the context in which the provision is used and the purpose it seeks to achieve. It may also be necessary to find out the intent of the legislature for enacting it and the serious and general inconveniences or injustice to persons relating thereto from its application. The provision is mandatory if it is passed for the purpose of enabling the doing of something and prescribes the formalities for doing certain things.   [Para 13,14]\n\nThe law on this issue can be summarised to the effect that in order to declare a provision mandatory, the test to be applied is as to whether non-compliance of the provision could render entire proceedings invalid or not. Whether the provision is mandatory or directory, depends upon the intent of Legislature and not upon the language for which the intent is clothed. The issue is to be examined having regard to the context, subject matter and object of the statutory provisions in question. The Court may find out as what would be the consequence which would flow from construing it in one way or the other and as to whether the Statute provides for a contingency of the non-compliance of the provisions and as to whether the non-compliance is visited by small penalty or serious consequence would flow therefrom and as to whether a particular interpretation would defeat or frustrate the legislation and if the provision is mandatory, the act done in breach thereof will be invalid.

In determining the market value, it is useful to consider the value paid for similar land at the material time under a genuine transaction. The market value envisages the price which a willing purchaser may pay for a bonafide transfer to a willing seller. The land value can differ depending upon the extent and nature of the land sold. A fully developed small plot in an important locality may fetch higher value than a larger area in an undeveloped condition and situated in a remote locality. It is for this reason that transaction in regard to a smaller property is not taken as the real basis for fixing the market value of a large property. Generally some deduction is made taking into consideration the expenses required for development of the larger tract to make smaller plots within the area in order to compare its price with the smaller plots. Principle has been stated in several decisions of the Supreme Court including Tribeni Devi's case reported in 1984(2) SCC 324.\n\nThe proposition that a large area of land cannot possibly fetch a price at the same rate at which small plots are sold, however, is not an absolute proposition and in given circumstances it would be permissible to take into account without deduction, the price fetched by the small plot of land while determining price of a larger piece of land. If the larger tract of land because of its advantageous position is capable of being used for the purpose for which small plots are used and is also situated in a developed area with little or no requirement of further development, the principle of deduction from the value for purpose of comparison is not warranted.

The lands are in the vicinity of city of Delhi and within 8-9 kilometers of Noida on Dadri Noida Delhi main road.  Habibpur and Gulsitapur are adjacent villages.  Having regard to location of villages compensation have been awarded on same basis and at same rates by High Court after undertaking a very detailed and meticulous examination of evidence on record to determine compensation payable.  It is well settled that having regard to principles laid down in Act, Court must determine compensation payable, but all said and done as assessment of compensation to be awarded does involve some rational guess work, having regard to all facts and circumstances of the case.  So far as quantum of compensation is concerned, Supreme Court did not find any illegality or irrationality in reasoning of High Court.  No reason to interfere with the order of High Court.\t\t\t\t\t       [Para 4,5,6]"

High Court found that Collector made Award on 27-06-1985 and application for making a reference was filed within time on 6-8-1985.  Claimants examined themselves on oath, and it was not even suggested to them that they had accepted compensation without protest.  No evidence was brought on record to establish that compensation was accepted by them without protest.  On other hand fact that claimants promptly filed their objections and sought reference u/s.18 established that claimants had not accepted compensation without protest, but their acceptance was subject to order that Reference Court or any other superior court may pass.  High Court was justified in holding that there was no material to substantiate contention that compensation had been accepted without protest by claimants. [Para 8]"

Zamindari Abolition Act found that there was no evidence whatsoever to substantiate plea that claimants were in illegal and unauthorized possession of lands which had vested in the State of U.P.  It was not shown that at any stage any action was taken to evict and dispossess unauthorized occupants of such lands which had vested in the State.  On the contrary it was not disputed that claimants were in possession till possession of land was taken from them pursuant to Notifications issued u/s.4(1) and S.6 of the Act, their possession was not disturbed by any action taken by Collector or Gaon Sabha under any law.  High Court also rightly noticed that such a plea could not be raised in a proceeding under Section 18.  Special Land Acquisition Officer offered compensation to the claimants obviously on basis that State recognized claimants as owners of lands which were sought to be acquired.  Having done so and having made a reference to Court u/s.18, it could not be contended in proceedings u/s.18 or in any proceedings arising therefrom that claimants, to whom compensation was offered were not owners of lands.  State ought to have taken appropriate proceedings, if any, to deny compensation to such claimants, who according to State were in occupation of lands which had vested in State.  [Para 10]"

S.17(4) of the Act was published on 25-08-1981 whereby an inquiry u/s.5-A was dispensed with.  Possession of land taken on 25-9-1981.  A declaration u/s.6 was also notified.  High Court declared invalid the notification u/s.6 issued without affording opportunity and without inquiry.  High Court observed that decision to obviate inquiry was without authority of law and recital to that effect in S.4 Notification is invalid.  State was directed to provide opportunity, hold inquiry u/s.5-A before making a fresh declaration, if any, u/s.6.  Notification was issued on 11-7-1983 inviting objections pursuant to Notification earlier issued u/s.4.  After considering objections Notification u/s.6 was issued on 7-10-1983.  Challenge went upto High Court.  High Court negatived claimant's contention that since original Notifications u/ss.4 and 6 were quashed and a fresh Notification issued on 11-7-1983, compensation must be determined by reckoning Notification issued on 11-7-1983 as Notification u/s.4.  High Court held that Notification u/s.4 issued on 25-8-1981 was in two parts - first part declared need for acquisition of lands in question for a public purpose, second part dispensed with inquiry u/s.5-A.  High Court had quashed only that part of Notification which dispensed with inquiry u/s.5-A.  Notification issued on 11-7-1983 did not even whisper that it was a Notification u/s.4.  It only recited earlier history which led to issuance of Notification inviting objections.  Thereafter on 7-10-1983 after considering objections, a Notification u/s.6 was issued which made a reference to Notification 11-7-1983 as Notification issued u/s.4(1).  High Court did not attach much importance to this recital in the Notification issued u/s.6 as Notification of 11-7-1983 did not purport to be a Notification u/s.4(1).  The Notification clearly mentioned that it was a Notification inviting objections u/s.5-A in continuation of Notification dated 25-8-1981 issued u/s.4(1).  High Court in earlier writ petition did not quash first part of Notification dated 25-8-1981 which remained intact.  Mere wrong mention of Section in subsequent Notification did not make Notification inviting objections u/s.5-A a Notification issued u/s.4(1).  In further appeal Supreme Court upheld High Court decision and ruled that issuance of a fresh declaration u/s.6 after withdrawing earlier one issued u/s.6 did not have effect of rendering S.4 notification ineffective and infructuous.

Sub-section (3) further commands that while determining the compensation under section 28-A, the provisions of sections 18 to 22 shall, in so far as they will apply to reference under section 28-A, would also apply to this section.  These provisions are clearly indicative that section 28-A is a Code in itself.  The procedure indicated in this section has to be followed and it's mandatory conditions must be satisfied before a person interested can take advantage of this provision.  Further under section 18 the claimant is required to file a written application within the specified time, failing which no reference can lie to the Collector or to the competent authority.  Under section 28-A(3) the provisions of section 18 are applicable and as such it will be more in line with the scheme of the Act and same meaning to the expression 'written application' appearing in section 28-A shall be applied as well.  2001(2) Mh.L.J. 279 - Overruled.

Once the language of the section is explicit that written application within the prescribed period has to be filed, there is hardly any scope to come to the conclusion that there is no requirement on the part of the applicant to move an application or that the Collector would exercise such power suo motu.  Such an approach would be contrary to the scheme of the Act and in fact it would amount to vesting of powers in SLAO which are not given by the Legislature and in fact such powers would be deemed to have been excluded by necessary implication on the cumulative reading of the relevant provisions.  But for the limited scope or jurisdiction vested in the Collector under section 28-A of the Act, the Collector would be functus officio in all other respects and would have no jurisdiction to redetermine the compensation under the scheme of the Act.  The provisions of section 28-A(2) do not give any substantive right for redetermination of the compensation.  The legal right accrues under sub-section (1) of section 28-A while sub-section (2) regulates the procedure for redetermination of the compensation upon receipt of an application under sub-section (1) of section 28-A.  The procedural or regulatory sub-sections cannot be read to alter the scope of the substantive provisions which creates a right but subject to the satisfaction of the mandatory conditions stated in the section.  The expression \"suo motu\" means of its own initiative.  The power to initiate must emerge from the language of the provisions.  Where the language of the provision is simple, unambiguous and is incapable of various meanings, then the principle of plain interpretation has to be applied.  The power to act suo motu should be spelt out from the provisions and it is normally difficult to infer such power, particularly when specific mode to initiate such process is stipulated in the statute itself.  Filing of an application, that too within the specified period from the date of award by the reference court, is the condition precedent for invocation of the scheme under section 28-A of the Act and its intent and purpose cannot be defeated by introducing power to act suo motu and giving notice to all concerned.  Thus the second point of law has to be answered in the negative.  1997(6) SCC 59, 2003(4) ALL MR 347 (S.C.) and (1997)4 SCC 473 - Ref. to.\t\t\t\t\t [Para 17,18]"

We can not add words in the explanation by reading into it a provision that gives to the explanation a narrower operation than what was intended for it by the legislature, so as to apply only to cases where an order of injunction is obtained by the land-owner and not by anyone else. \t\t\t\t\t\t     [Para 14]\n\nThe objects and reasons for introducing Section 11-A into the Act were that \"the pendency of acquisition proceedings for long periods often causes hardship to the affected parties and renders unrealistic the scale of compensation offered to them\" and \"it is proposed to provide for a period of two years from the date of publication of the declaration under Section 6 of the Act within which the Collector should make his award under the Act\".   The emphasis, therefore, was on the Collector making his award within the period prescribed.  However, the legislature was also aware of the reality of the situation and was not oblivious of the fact that in many cases acquisition proceedings were stalled by stay orders obtained from courts of law by interested parties.  It, therefore, became imperative that in computing the period of two years, the period during which an order of stay operated, which prevented the authorities from taking any action or proceeding in pursuance of the declaration, must be excluded.  If such a provision was not made, an acquisition proceeding could be easily defeated by obtaining an order of stay and prolonging the litigation thereafter.  Explanation to Section 11-A was meant to deal with situations of this kind.  The explanation is in the widest possible terms which do not limit its operation to cases where an order of stay is obtained by a land-owner alone.  One can conceive of cases where apart from land-owners others may be interested in stalling the land acquisition proceeding.  It is no doubt true that in most of the reported decisions the party that obtained the stay order happened to be the owner of the land acquired.  But that will not lead us to the conclusion that the explanation applied only to cases where stay had been obtained by the owners of the land.  There may be others who may be interested in obtaining an order of stay being aggrieved by the acquisition proceeding.  It may be that on account of development of that area some persons in the vicinity may be adversely affected, or it may be for any other reason that persons in the locality are adversely affected by the project for which acquisition is being made.  One can imagine many instances in which a person other than the owner may be interested in defeating the acquisition proceeding.  Once an order of stay is obtained and the Government and the Collector are prevented from taking any further action pursuant to the declaration, they cannot be faulted for the delay, and therefore, the period during which the order of stay operates must be excluded.  In a sense, operation of the order of stay provides a justification for the delay in taking further steps in the acquisition proceeding for which the authorities are not to blame.  [Para 16]"

It was under the licence issued by the Salt Department of the Union of India that the claimants were allowed to manufacture the salt in the land in question.\t\t\t\t [Para 6]\n\nLand Acquisition Officer on this premises granted the compensation as Nil, which was challenged in reference U/s.18 of the Act.  Reference Court decided the issue of claimants' ownership over the disputed land and granted a compensation for land and for loss of salt business.  In the instant appeal State challenges the said order of Reference Court.  It was held that, the scope of inquiry in the reference proceedings under Section 18 of the Act would depend upon the subject matter of acquisition. If the acquisition is related to the limited rights in the land without any reference to the ownership right in the property, certainly the question of dealing with the ownership issue to ascertain compensation on that count would not arise in the reference proceedings under Section 18. The reference under Section 18 is essentially on account of dissatisfaction of the claimants about the award given by the Land Acquisition Officer. If the award does not relate to the subject of ownership of the land on the ground that the same has not been the subject matter of acquisition, the question of Reference Court going into the issue of title would not arise. It may be a different case where the subject matter of acquisition also includes ownership of land and the Land Acquisition Officer on account of lack of evidence on the part of the claimants to establish their right of ownership refuses to award any compensation on such claim. In such a case certainly the issue of ownership could be subject matter of reference. In a case where the notification under Section 4 and the declaration under Section 6 do not include the subject matter of ownership of land, the question of Reference Court going into the said issue would not arise. For the purpose of acquisition under the said Act, the term \"land\" has to be understood either in its entirety which would include all the interests in it or of some of the interests therein, depending upon the facts of each case. The land which already belongs to the Government cannot be a subject matter of acquisition under the said Act. Consequently, the land, wherein the government has subsisting ownership interest, though can also be subjected to acquisition proceedings, but to the extent of \"other interest\" existing in favour of 'others' who could be the \"interested persons\" within the meaning of the said expression under the said Act.  [Para 37,38]\n\nIn the instant case, it is not in dispute that the notification and the declaration under Sections 4 and 6 respectively were in relation to the leasehold and other limited interest in the land and not in relation to the ownership right in the land in question. Being so, there was no occasion either for the Land Acquisition Officer or for the Reference Court to deal with the aspect of title of the land or the issue of ownership of the land. Once the title of the property or ownership of the land is beyond the scope of the acquisition, one fails to understand how it can form subject matter of dispute before the reference court. The reference under Section 18 can be only of the dispute pertaining to the subject matter of acquisition. In the case in hand, subject matter of acquisition being limited and restricted to the leasehold rights and other outstanding interests, other than ownership right in the land, neither the Collector had occasion to refer such issue for adjudication nor it was referred and for the same reasons also the reference court could not have exceeded its jurisdiction and assumed jurisdiction to deal with the issue of title of ownership of the property. The government, therefore, is justified in contending that the issue of ownership is beyond the scope of powers under Section 18 of the Act in the facts and circumstances of the case. Moreover, bare perusal of the notification which was issued under Section 4 and the declaration under Section 6 clearly discloses that it was in relation to the leasehold and other outstanding interests of persons in the lands of Central and State Government bearing survey numbers specified in the schedule to the notification. Obviously, therefore, the notification clearly excluded the issue of ownership of the land as it already belonged to the Government and the acquisition was restricted to the leasehold and other outstanding interests of persons in such land. Hence, in the facts and circumstances of the case, the reference court could not have dealt with the issue of ownership of the land, the findings given by the reference court on this issue cannot be sustained and are liable to be set aside, being beyond the jurisdiction of the reference court.\t  [Para 42,47,57]"

Therefore, it is only the  brothers and not every member of the H.U.F. who is entitled to the benefit. In other words for the purpose of treating the person as an 'affected person' a wider meaning has been given, but at the same time limiting it to a class of members of the H.U.F. The expression \"holding\" has been used to mean the total land held by a person as an occupant or tenant or as owner. The expression \"occupant\" has not been defined under the Act. However, it is relatable to the person. The question is whether the expression \"person\" in case of HUF would mean each member of the HUF to be treated as a distinct person. The object of the Act is to acquire excess land beyond the slab from the persons from the benefited zone. If the expression \"person\" is used to mean each member of the HUF then it would be practically impossible to acquire any land for rehabilitation, considering that most of the lands are still held on undivided basis, just like the case of the petitioners. If the expression is so held then for all purposes it will be impossible to apply the slab. The word \"person\" and the words \"affected person\" must be seen in that context. The intent of the Legislature, therefore, is to treat an affected person differently from a person in a benefited zone. In the benefited zone, the expression person must be given normal meaning and not an extended meaning. If so held H.U.F. is a person. As such there is no merit in the contention that the person includes each member of the H.U.F. and consequently the area must be divided amongst each member of H.U.F. and if that be the case then the slab would not apply.

The said section 25 now stands amended.  In view of the amendment to section 25, the amount of compensation awarded by the Court shall not be less than the amount awarded by the Collector under section 11, meaning thereby the limits under the unamended section put on the powers of the Reference Court on a reference being made under section 18 to the higher quantum of compensation have been done away.  However, the said amendment to section 25 has been held to be prospective in operation by the Apex Court and is made to apply only to the acquisition made subsequent to 24th September, 1984.  In the present case, the reference being of 1981, it would be within the sweep of unamended section 25 of the Act.  Turning to the facts of the case in hand, it is not in dispute that in the present case no reply to the notice issued under section 9(3)(4) was given by the claimants.  They did not make any claim for compensation.  In that view of the matter, it was not open for the respondents to invoke jurisdiction of the Reference Court under section 18 of the Act.  A reference, in that view of the matter, was not maintainable.  (2003)3 SCC 463 - Followed.  [Para 3]"

This is a case which can hardly justify condonation of delay. The hassles which in any case are unspecified in the application can always be set right by the applicants and the approval can be granted expeditiously. However, in the present case, there is no explanation even for a period of two years. The other point raised on behalf of the applicant is that if delay is condoned, it would cause no prejudice to the claimants is not tenable. In law advantage has accrued to the non-applicants claimants and the same ought not to be withdrawn in a mechanical manner and that too without any sufficient cause being shown to the applicants. This itself is the prejudice to the claimants. Before the delay can be condoned and claimants can be subjected to a prolonged litigation, the onus to show sufficient cause lies is upon the applicant State. The lands have been acquired by the State in exercise of its statutory power and eminent domain. The claimants are owners of small parcel/parts of lands varying between 2000 and 4000 sq. mtrs. and deprivation of their legitimate dues on account of compensation would not be in the interest of justice. Secondly, the claimants have not been paid their enhanced compensation for a considerable time and/or they have not received the same. If the appeals are admitted and interim orders are passed, it obviously will result in affecting the rights of the claimants to receive the enhanced compensation, adversely. More so when the claims have been enhanced by the Court of competent jurisdiction in exercise of its powers under Sections 28-A and 18 of the Act primarily based upon the awards which have been made by the Courts from time to time in relation to the same land or adjacent lands and for the same Notification. Despite, awards/judgments of the Courts, which have even attained finality, the Claimants are not permitted to receive compensation that itself would be a sufficient prejudice to their rights. It is not in dispute that the compensation has been enhanced to Rs.29/- and/or Rs.30/- by the awards under appeal, while under the earlier awards which were relied upon by the parties, even compensation at the rate of Rs.32/- to Rs.38/- has been determined. Applicants having failed to show sufficient or reasonable cause (in fact they have shown no cause) for the condonation of delay, Court declined to condone delay of more than two years caused in filing appeals.

The instant case is not one which is governed by the provisions of the Limitation Act. The Land Acquisition Collector in making an award does not act as a Court within the meaning of the Limitation Act. It is also clear from the provisions of the Land Acquisition Act that the provisions of the Limitation Act have not been made applicable to proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act in the matter of making an award under Section 11-A of the Act. However, Section 11-A of the Act does provide a period of limitation within which the Collector shall make his award. The explanation thereto also provides for exclusion of the period during which any action or proceeding to be taken in pursuance of the declaration is stayed by an order of a court. Such being the provision, there is no scope for importing into Section 11-A of the Land Acquisition Act the provisions of Section 12 of the Limitation Act. The application of Section 12 of the Limitation Act is also confined to matters enumerated therein. The time taken for obtaining a certified copy of the judgment is excluded because a certified copy is required to be filed while preferring an appeal/revision/review etc. challenging the impugned order. Thus a court is not permitted to read into Section 11A of the Act a provision for exclusion of time taken to obtain a certified copy of the judgment and order. The court has, therefore, no option but to compute the period of limitation for making an award in accordance with the provisions of Section 11-A of the Act after excluding such period as can be excluded under the Explanation to Section 11-A of the Act.  [Para 54]\n\nThe legislature wherever it considered necessary incorporated by express words the rule incorporated in Section 12 of the Limitation Act. It has done so expressly in Section 28-A of the Act while it has consciously not incorporated this rule in Section 11-A even while providing for exclusion of time under the explanation. The intendment of the legislature is therefore unambiguous and does not permit the Court to read words into Section 11-A of the Act so as to enable it to read Section 12 of the Limitation Act into Section 11-A of the Land Acquisition Act.

To be noted that under Section 18 Reference could be in respect of the measurement of the land and/ or the amount of compensation and/ or in respect of persons to whom it is payable and/or for apportionment of compensation amongst persons interested. Section 30 merely deals with apportionment of compensation when the amount of compensation has been settled. Thus, Section 18 is to be invoked when a person claiming a pre-existing right has notice of the acquisition proceedings, whereas Section 30 comes into play only if a person had no notice of the acquisition proceedings or the rights came into existence after the acquisition proceedings. It is clear that the person who had notice of the acquisition proceedings and who, by virtue of Section 50, is debarred from filing a Reference under Section 18 cannot be allowed to apply for a Reference under Section 30. In this case, Court has already held that the Respondents were not entitled to apply for a  Reference under Section 18. This meant that they were not entitled to seek a Reference not just in respect of the compensation but also for apportionment of the compensation. Once it has been held that they had no right to move under Section 18 there was no question of their being permitted to move under Section 30. To permit a party, who cannot apply under Section 18, to apply under Section 30 would  be to render Section 50 nugatory.   [Para 21]"

Such evidence will have to be read along with the other materials on record and there must be some corroborative piece of evidence in support of the average rate arrived at in the ready reckoner.

Though the provisions of Sections 23 and 24 of the said Act are applicable to the proceedings before the reference Court, the principle behind the said provisions should not be ignored by the Land Acquisition Officer while fixing the compensation under Section 11 of the said Act.  Being so, the contention that because the ready reckoner has statutory basis since 1995, the same could safely be relied upon for ascertaining the market value of the land acquired cannot be accepted.

This is in consonance with the position that a fresh re-appropriation is not contemplated or warranted by the scheme of the Act.

But, beyond that, the decree-holder cannot seek to re-open the entire transaction and proceed to re-calculate the interest on the whole amount and seek a re-appropriation as a whole in the light of the appellate decree.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 49]"

                "description": "Publication of notification - Expression \"in two daily newspapers circulating in that locality\" - Meaning of - Authorities should ensure that notification is published in the newspapers having reasonably wide circulation.\n\nThe purpose of requiring newspaper publication is to give as wide a publicity to the notification as possible, as the State Gazettes do not have a wide circulation and causing public notice of the substance of the notification at convenient places in the locality would give notice only in specific pockets in the locality. Legislature therefore provided for publication in two newspapers (of which at least one being in the regional language) to have a wider reach. Having regard to the object and purpose of the provision, it is evident that publication should be in newspapers which have a reasonably good circulation in the locality. If the publication is to be made in obscure newspapers having only token or insignificant circulation, either to cut the cost of publication or by way of political or official patronage, that will defeat the very purpose of providing for publication in newspapers. [Para 17]\n\nIf there is failure to publish in two daily newspapers or if the publication is in two newspapers that have no circulation at all in the locality, without anything more, the notification under section 4(1) of the Act and the consequential acquisition proceedings will be vitiated, on the ground of non-compliance with an essential condition of section 4(1) of the Act. If the two newspapers carrying the publication of the notification have reasonably wide circulation in the locality, (apart from the publication of the notification in the Gazette and causing public notice of the substance of the notification to be given at convenient places in the locality), then the requirements of section 4(1) are complied with and all persons concerned in the locality shall be deemed to have notice of the notification. (For this purpose, the publication need not be in newspapers having the widest or largest circulation, but it is sufficient if the publication is in newspapers having reasonably wide circulation). In that event, neither the notification under section 4(1), nor the consequential acquisition proceedings would be open to challenge, on the ground of violation of Section 4 of the Act. If the newspapers in which the notification is published were circulating in the locality, but did not have a reasonably wide circulation in the locality, then neither the notification under section 4(1) nor the consequential acquisition proceedings, will become vitiated automatically. If the person aggrieved, apart from demonstrating that the two newspapers did not have reasonably wide circulation in the locality, also asserts that as a consequence, he did not have notice of the proposed acquisition that was provided for in Section 4(1) of the Act, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the acquisition to the extent of the land of such person will be vitiated. But if such assertion is rebutted by the acquiring authority by placing evidence to show that the person concerned had in fact notice (as for example where he participated in the enquiry under section 5-A of the Act), the acquisition will not be vitiated on the ground of violation of section 4-A of the Act. If the person challenging the acquisition is able to establish that the notifications were deliberately and with malafides, published in newspapers having negligible circulation, to avoid notice to the persons concerned, then section 4(1) will be violated.

If from the facts it can be inferred that a party knew about the subject matter of the notice, knowledge is imputed by implied notice. For example, if the purpose of the notice is to require a party to appear before an authority on a particular date, even though such a notice is not personally served on him, if the person appears before the authority on that date or participates in the subsequent proceedings, then the person can be said to have implied notice. Notice arising by presumption of law from the existence of certain specified facts and circumstances is constructive or deemed notice. For example, any person purchasing or obtaining a transfer of an immovable property is deemed to have notice of all transactions relating to such property effected by registered instruments till the date of his acquisition. Or, where the statute provides for publication of the notification relating to a proposed acquisition of lands in the Gazette and newspapers and by causing public notice of the substance of the notification at convenient places in the locality, but does not provide for actual direct notice, then such provision provides for constructive notice; and on fulfillment of those requirements, all persons interested in the lands proposed for acquisition are deemed to have notice of the proposal regarding acquisition.

In other words, if notice issued under section 12(2) in relation to the award passed under section 11 contains information regarding identity and the area of land acquired, the rate of the compensation awarded and the share of the addressee of the notice in the compensation awarded then it could be sufficient compliance of the provisions of section 12(2) of the said Act which would enable the interested person to file objections, if any, under section 18 in case he is dissatisfied on account of any of the factors mentioned in the said provision of law.  For this reason, he need not have copy of the award itself.  Once reference is made, he can even elaborate his grounds of objections before the Reference Court and the Reference Court can allow amendment by resorting to the provisions of Order VI, Rule 17, CPC.\n\nIn the instant case, the award, in fact, was ready on 11-04-1985 and a copy thereof was available with the claimants.  As the same was not signed because the concerned S.L.O. was transferred, it was required to be signed by the second S.L.O. and that is what was done on 17-06-1986 for the purpose of its declaration under section 11 of the said Act.  The above facts thus reveal the knowledge of the contents of the award to the claimants even on the date of the receipt of the notice under section 12 of the said Act itself.  The application filed under section 18 of the said Act was, therefore, clearly beyond the period of six weeks from the date of service of notice under section 12.  [Para 11,18,19]"

It has been applied in cases relating to insurance, taxation, compensation under the Motor Vehicles Act as well as under the Labour Laws.

All that was required to create or realize potential of such land was to annex or merge the said strip of land with the land to its rear. In that event, the strip of land will become the 'access' to the rear-side land from the main road and will also become the frontage of the aggregate land, thereby enhancing the potential and value of the rear-side land, as also creating a potential for its own use. The contention that a land adjoining the Highway should be treated as having no development potential (and therefore as land without much value except as ordinary agricultural land), while considering the lands to its rear which are farther away from the road, or other adjoining lands of the same extent, but having more depth (so as to extend beyond the 40 meters margin) as having potential for development, is illogical and cannot be accepted.

                "description": "Acquisition Of Land For Public Purpose - Compensation wholly or partly out of public revenues - Meaning of - Word \"part\" does not necessarily mean a substantial part in each and every case.\n\nPer majority (Subba Rao, J. dissenting):- Whether taken contribution meets the requirements of the law would depend upon the facts of every case. Indeed the fact that the State's contribution is nominal may well indicate, in particular circumstances, that the action of the State was a colourable exercise of power. 'Part' does not necessarily mean a substantial part and that it will be open to the Court in every case which comes up before it to examine whether the contribution made by the State satisfies the requirement of the law. In this case we are satisfied that it satisfies the requirement of law. Held, on the facts of the case that the decision of the Government to contribute Rs.100/- towards the cost of acquisition of the land which was worth Rs.4,50,000/- satisfied the requirement of Proviso to S.6(1) and the notification cannot be challenged as a colourable exercise of the power. \t [Para 52]\n\nPer Subba Rao, J. (Dissenting) :- Unless the Government agrees to contribute a substantial part of the compensation, depending upon the circumstances of each case, the condition imposed by the proviso on the exercise by the appropriate Government of its jurisdiction is not complied with. In the instant case it is impossible to say that a sum of Rs.100 out of an estimated, compensation which may go even beyond Rs.4,00,000 is in any sense of the term a substantial part of the said compensation. The Government has clearly broken the condition and therefore, it has no jurisdiction to issue the declaration under S.6 of the Act.  [Para 64]\n\nThe underlying object of the section is apparent: it is to provide for a safeguard against abuse of power. A substantial contribution from public coffers is ordinarily a guarantee that the acquisition is for a public purpose. But it is argued that the terms of the section are satisfied if the appropriate Government contributes a nominal sum, say a pie, even though that total compensation payable may run into lakhs. This interpretation would lead to extraordinary results. The Government may acquire the land of A for B for a declared public purpose, contributing a pie towards the estimated compensation of, say Rs.1,00,000. If that, was the intention of the Legislature, it would not have imposed a condition of payment of part of the compensation, for that provision would not serve the purpose for which it must have been intended. Therefore, a reasonable meaning should be given to the expression 'wholly or partly'. The proviso says that the compensation shall be paid by the company or, wholly or partly, out of public revenues. A contrast between these two modes of payment suggests the idea that in one case the compensation must come out of the company's coffers and in the other case the whole or some reasonable part of it should come from public revenues. This idea excludes the assumption that practically no compensation need come out of public revenues. The juxtaposition of the words \"wholly or partly \" and the disjunctive between them emphasize the same idea. What is substantial part of a compensation depends upon the facts of each case, the estimate of the compensation and other relevant circumstances. While a court will not go meticulously into the question to strike a balance between a part and a whole, it will certainly be in a position to ascertain broadly whether in a particular case the amount contributed by the Government towards compensation is so illusory that it cannot conceivably be a substantial part of the consideration. \t [Para 64]"

Sub-section (3) of Section 6 of the LA Act makes a declaration under Section 6 conclusive evidence that the land is needed for a public purpose.

Such appeals which mostly relate to the correctness of the quantum of compensation or apportionment, raise both questions of facts as well as questions of law. The provisions of Order 41 of the Code are made applicable to such appeals. The High Court, should therefore, if it wants to dismiss an appeal summarily without issuing notice, assign brief reasons, though not required to render a 'brief judgment'. Subject to the requirements and limitations placed by the statute providing for the appeals, appeals may be disposed of summarily, where so provided. 'Summary decision' refers to a decision which is short and quick and not elaborate. But it does not mean 'non-reasoned dismissal', as any order appealable in law has to be reasoned. A dismissal in limine refers to dismissal at the outset. Summary dismissal or dismissal in limine does not refer to a dismissal without assigning reasons.   [Para 9]\n\nIn this case the Land Acquisition Collector has awarded Rs.10,250 per bigha. The Reference Court awarded Rs.1,10,250 per bigha. The Reference Court stated that one bigha is equivalent to 2250 sq.yds. and it was awarding Rs.45/- per sq.yd. On that basis, that is at the rate of Rs.45 per sq.yd. the price of a bigha comprising 2225 sq.yds. would be Rs.1,01,250 and not Rs.1,10,250. Thus even without a detailed examination, there is an error apparent on the face of the award of the Reference Court. The other grounds raised by the appellant also deserved examination and consideration, particularly having regard to the fact that several other appeals relating to the same notification, against similar fixation of market value by the Reference Court were already admitted by the High Court and pending consideration.

                "description": "Acquisition of private property for public purpose - Principles involved and procedure to be adopted stated.\n\nFrom the analysis of the relevant statutory provisions and interpretation thereof by this Court in different cases, the following principles can be culled out:\n\n(i)\tEminent domain is a right inherent in every sovereign to take and appropriate property belonging to citizens for public use. To put it differently, the sovereign is entitled to reassert its dominion over any portion of the soil of the State including private property without its owner's consent provided that such assertion is on account of public exigency and for public good.\n\n(ii)\tThe legislations which provide for compulsory acquisition of private property by the State fall in the category of expropriatory legislation and such legislation must be construed strictly.\n\n(iii)\tThough, in exercise of the power of eminent domain, the Government can acquire the private property for public tpurpose, it must be remembered that compulsory taking of one's property is a serious matter. If he property belongs to economically disadvantaged segment of the society or people suffering from other handicaps, then the Court is not only entitled but is duty bound to scrutinize the action/decision of the State with greater vigilance, care and circumspection keeping in view the fact that the land owner is likely to become landless and deprived of the only source of his livelihood and/or shelter.\n\n(iv)\tThe property of a citizen cannot be acquired by the State and/or its agencies/instrumentalities without complying with the mandate of Sections 4, 5-A and 6 of the Act. A public purpose, however, laudable it may be does not entitle the State to invoke the urgency provisions because the same have the effect of depriving the owner of his right to property without being heard. Only in a case of real urgency, the State can invoke the urgency provisions and dispense with the requirement of hearing the land owner or other interested persons.\n\n(v)\tSection 17(1) read with Section 17(4) confers extraordinary power upon the State to acquire private property without complying with the mandate of Section 5-A. These provisions can be invoked only when the purpose of acquisition cannot brook the delay of even few weeks or months. Therefore, before excluding the application of Section 5-A, the concerned authority must be fully satisfied that time of few weeks or months likely to be taken in conducting inquiry under Section 5-A will, in all probability, frustrate the public purpose for which land is proposed to be acquired.\n\n(vi)\tThe satisfaction of the Government on the issue of urgency is subjective but is a condition precedent to the exercise of power under Section 17(1) and the same can be challenged on the ground that the purpose for which the private property is sought to be acquired is not a public purpose at all or that the exercise of power is vitiated due to mala fides or that the concerned authorities did not apply mind to the relevant factors and the records.\n\n(vii)\tThe exercise of power by the Government under Section 17(1) does not necessarily result in exclusion of Section 5-A of the Act in terms of which any person interested in land can file objection and is entitled to be heard in support of his objection. The use of word \"may\" in sub-section (4) of Section 17 makes it clear that it merely enables the Government to direct that the provisions of Section 5-A would not apply to the cases covered under sub-section (1) or (2) of Section 17. In other words, invoking of Section 17(4) is not a necessary concomitant of the exercise of power under Section 17(1).\n\n(viii)\tThe acquisition of land for residential, commercial, industrial or institutional purposes can be treated as an acquisition for public purposes within the meaning of Section 4 but that, by itself, does not justify the exercise of power by the Government under Sections 17(1) and/or 17(4). The Court can take judicial notice of the fact that planning, execution and implementation of the schemes relating to development of residential, commercial, industrial or institutional areas usually take few years. Therefore, the private property cannot be acquired for such purpose by invoking the urgency provision contained in Section 17(1). In any case, exclusion of the rule of audi alteram partem embodied in Section 5-A (1) and (2) is not at all warranted in such matters.\n\n(ix)\tIf land is acquired for the benefit of private persons, the Court should view the invoking of Sections 17(1) and/or 17(4) with suspicion and carefully scrutinize the relevant record before adjudicating upon the legality of such acquisition.

It needs lot of deliberations and planning keeping in view various scientific and technical parameters and environmental concerns. The private entrepreneurs, who are desirous of making investment in the State, take their own time in setting up the industrial units. Usually, the State Government and its agencies/instrumentalities would give them two to three years' to put up their factories, establishments etc. Therefore, time required for ensuring compliance of the provisions contained in Section 5-A cannot, by any stretch of imagination, be portrayed as delay which will frustrate the purpose of acquisition. In this context, it is apposite to note that the time limit for filing objection under Section 5-A(1) is only 30 days from the date of publication of the notification under Section 4(1). Of course, in terms of sub-section (2), the Collector is required to give opportunity of hearing to the objector and submit report to the Government after making such further inquiry, as he thinks necessary. This procedure is likely to consume some time, but as has been well said, \"Principles of natural justice are to some minds burdensome but this price-a small price indeed-has to be paid if we desire a society governed by the rule of law.\"   [Para 55]\n\nIn this case, the Development Authority sent proposal some time in 2006. The authorities up to the level of the Commissioner completed the exercise of survey and preparation of documents by the end of December, 2006 but it took one year and almost three months to the State Government to issue notification under Section 4 read with Sections 17(1) and 17(4). If this much time was consumed between the receipt of proposal for the acquisition of land and issue of notification, it is not possible to accept the argument that four to five weeks within which the objections could be filed under sub-section (1) of Section 5-A and the time spent by the Collector in making inquiry under sub-section (2) of Section 5-A would have defeated the object of acquisition.

At the hearing, the objector can make an effort to convince the Land Acquisition Collector to make recommendation against the acquisition of his land. He can also point out that land proposed to be acquired is not suitable for the purpose specified in the notification issued under Section 4(1). Not only this, he can produce evidence to show that another piece of land is available and the same can be utilized for execution of the particular project or scheme. Though, it is neither possible nor desirable to make a list of the grounds on which the landowner can persuade the Collector to make recommendations against the proposed acquisition of land, but what is important is that the Collector should give a fair opportunity of hearing to the objector and objectively consider his plea against the acquisition of land. Only thereafter, he should make recommendations supported by brief reasons as to why the particular piece of land should or should not be acquired and whether or not the plea put forward by the objector merits acceptance. In other words, the recommendations made by the Collector must reflect objective application of mind to the objections filed by the landowners and other interested persons.  [Para 25]"

Section 28-A also represents statutory embodiment of the doctrine of equality in matters relating to the acquisition of land. The Act which was enacted in 1894 and was amended after 90 years has the potential of depriving a large segment of the society i.e. the 'agriculturist' of their only source of livelihood. The scheme of Section 28-A provide some solace to this segment of the society by ensuring that such of the land owners whose land was acquired under the same notification but who could not, on account of poverty, ignorance and other disabilities join others in seeking reference under Section 18 get an opportunity to claim compensation at par with others. This section is aimed at removing inequality in the payment of compensation in lieu of acquisition of land under the same notification. To put it differently, this section gives a chance to the land owner, who may not have applied under Section 18 for determination of market value by the Court to seek re-determination of the amount of compensation, if any other similarly situated land owner succeeds in persuading the Reference Court to fix higher market value of the acquired land.  This opportunity can be availed by filing application in prescribed time.  (1995)2 SCC 736 - Rel. on.  [Para 9]"

There is nothing in the plain language of Section 28-A(3) from which it can be inferred that a person who has not accepted the award made under Section 28-A(2) is precluded from making an application to the Collector with the request to refer the matter to the Court. Of course, the Court to which reference is made under Section 28-A(3) will have to bear in mind that a person who has not sought reference under Section 18 cannot get compensation higher than the one payable to those who had sought reference under that section.

The Constitution now guarantees that no person shall be deprived of his property save by authority of law. If the Union or the State Government is desirous of depriving any person of his property it can only do so by authority of law. That authority, as is facially evident, inter alia, is the necessity to tender the payment of 80 per cent of the compensation estimated by the Collector in the event that Section 17 is to be pressed into service, with the objective of denying the landowners remonstration rights by filing Objections in consonance with Section 5A of the L.A. Act. Expropriatory legislation, such as the L.A. Act, must compulsorily be construed strictly. The Appellant State cannot be permitted to invoke one part of Section 17 while discarding another.

The purpose is to afford an opportunity of making representation to the aggrieved person before any order, which may adversely affect his interest in any immovable property, may be passed by the LAO and subsequent notification be issued by the State Government. non-adherence to the principles envisaged under the Act at the stage of making recommendations, not only defeats the purpose and object of the provisions of Section 5-A(2) but also introduces illegality into the opinion formulated by the State Government after considering the report so submitted by the LAO and therefore, by necessary implication, permeates the notification issued under Section 6 of the Act with such illegality.\t [Para 23,28]"

The said rate pertains to the lands later named as Sectors 13 and 14, which are situated across the lands in lis herein. The Single Judge, after keeping the base price at Rs.22/- per sq. yard has enhanced the compensation at the rate of 15% per annum for the lands acquired vide notifications dated 04.06.1980, 13.03.1981, 22.06.1982 and 05.07.1982 later named as Sectors 6, 3, 9 and 7, respectively.

                "description": "Requirement of 'taking an order for the acquisition of the land' as contemplated by S.7 of the Act - Requirement is a substantive and not just procedural requirement of law - Also, the requirement of law has to be treated as mandatory and not directory.\n\nLand Acquisition Act does not provide for any consequences that should follow in case the Collector does not \"take order for acquisition of the land\", as contemplated by section 7 of the said Act. A close reading of section 7 of the said Act in fact contemplates only issuance of a direction to the Collector \"to take order for acquisition of the land\". Thus, it contemplated \"only a direction\" to take such an order. It does not even contemplate that the Collector has to take such an order and only thereupon the Collector can proceed further with the acquisition proceedings. It is also true that there is no specific and explicit provision in the said Act that requires, much less mandatorily the Collector 'to take an order' as contemplated by Section 7 of the said Act, before taking further steps towards the acquisition proceedings.  However, the object and purpose of section 7 is obviously that the Collector must be authorised and/or empowered to take further steps, contemplated by provisions of section 8 onwards, for the purpose of acquisition of the land that are declared to be needed for the public purpose under section 6 of the said Act. In the light of our aforesaid conclusion that requirement for the collector to take such an order is the substantive (and not just a procedural requirement) of the said Act, such a requirement for the collect to take order as contemplated by Section 7 of the said Act will have to be read into the Act to make the entire scheme of the said Act complete and meaningful. Absence of such an order as contemplated by the Section 7 of the said Act will amount to a missing link in the chain of requirements/steps that are to be taken for the compulsory acquisition of lands under the said Act. The true compliance with the letter and spirit of the provisions of Section 7 of the said Act is not in just directing the collector to take order for acquisition of land but in the collector factually and actually taking such an order, as issuance of such an order alone will clothe the collector with jurisdiction and/or authority and/or power to proceed further with the compulsory acquisition of the lands under the said Act.\n\nThe appropriate Govt. is possessed of powers to take decision to acquire land or not. The power in some cases is delegated to Commissioner. What is more important is that the power to decide whether particular land is to be acquired or not is not with the Collector. Therefore, section 7 directs to Collector to take order from the appropriate Govt. or Commissioner. Therefore, where Collector approaches the Govt. or Commissioner to take order for acquisition of land, the appropriate Govt. or Commissioner has to take decision as to whether land is to be acquired by compulsory acquisition. This decision is original decision in whole acquisition proceeding. On performance of this procedure, two effects follows- (1) that Government has decided to acquire land compulsorily thereby incurring liability to pay compensation at market rate; (2) the Collector is clothed with jurisdiction and power to acquire land, as provided by section 8 onwards. Therefore, such important provision cannot be said to procedural one or directory in nature, as contended by respondent. Therefore, post facto approval with retrospective effect will not protect the present acquisition proceedings.  AIR 2006 SC 289 and AIR 1957 SC 912 - Ref. to.  [Para 50,51,54]"

The High Court was of the view that the size and situation did not warrant any belting and all lands deserved the same rate of compensation. The Authority has not placed any material to show that any area was less advantageously situated. Therefore the view of the High Court that compensation should be awarded at an uniform rate does not call for interference.

It is for the Court to determine the market value of the land once a reference has been made to it. The determination of the market value of the land is adjudicative process which the Court must complete irrespective of participation by the claimant in the enquiry. If that is the mandate of law and this is the obligation on the Court, then, all such materials as are placed before the Court to enable it to determine the market value, must be permitted to be produced. Production of materials and additional facts/figures, data is something which is part of a procedure evolved by the Court. There are procedural provisions by which the proceedings are governed. Ultimately, the procedural provisions are hand-maids of Justice. They can never be held to be mandatory. Therefore, it will have to be held that the provisions, namely, sections 18, 19 to 21 read with section 53 of the Act enable the claimant to apply for amendment to the reference. Merely because an application for amendment is made does not necessarily mean that it has to be granted. Ultimately, whether application will be allowed or not depends on facts and circumstances in each case and no general rule can be laid down.  It would not be just and proper to hold that the reference before the Civil Court cannot be amended.  The proceedings before the Reference Court are \"civil proceedings\". There is no reason for restricting expression \"Civil proceedings\" only to those proceedings which arise out of civil suit or proceedings which are tried as civil suits.  [Para 32,18,20]\n\nThe power to allow amendments of pleadings is also conferred so as to enable the Court to determine the real question in controversy between the parties. All amendments shall be made as may be necessary for the purpose of determining the real question and controversy between the parties. If such is the power, then, to hold that it is unavailable while deciding a reference under section 18 would be contrary to the object of determining the compensation to be awarded for compulsory acquisition of the land for public purpose. Justice and fair play demands that this procedural provision which assists the Court in determining the matter must be held to be a necessary aid or else the determination may not be fair.  [Para 21]\n\nThe word \"pleadings\" is defined to mean plaint or written statement. Thus, when the nature of the proceedings before the Reference Court are such as placing the applicant in the position of plaintiff and his application a plaint so also the burden cast upon him in law, then, one can safely hold that what are filed before the Reference Court are pleadings. Once the object and purpose is to award compensation at the market value for a land acquired for public purpose, then, it would not be proper to hold that the Court while determining the matter referred under section 18 of the Act does not have any power to allow the amendment of the pleadings. Of course, the ambit and scope of this discretionary power does not mean all amendments prayed for should be granted straightaway. The discretion must be exercised judiciously. 2008(6) ALL MR 65, Decision in F.A. No.226/1994, Dt.:-11-11-2008 - Overruled.  [Para 29]"

It is now a fairly settled principle that Appeal is in continuation of the suit. In these circumstances, there is no reason why the amendment should not be allowed so as to enhance the claim made under reference application at appellate stage. Thus, amendment can also be granted at the appellate stage, however subject to the restraint prescribed under Order 6, Rule 17 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Whether amendment in particular case can be granted or not depends on facts and circumstances of each individual case. For example, the amendment so as to enhance the claim under reference application if rejected by Reference Court and the said order if allowed to become final, then similar amendment may not be allowed at appellate stage. Even the delay and latches on the part of applicant in applying for amendment can be considered in proper perspective.  [Para 22]"

A 'willing seller' refers to a person who is not acting under any pressure to sell the property, that is, where the sale is not a distress sale. A willing seller is a person who knowing the advantages and disadvantages of his property, sells the property after ascertaining the prevailing market prices at the fair and reasonable value. Similarly, a willing purchaser refers to a person who is not under any pressure or compulsion to purchase the property, and who, having the choice of different properties, voluntarily decides to buy a particular property by assessing its advantages and disadvantages and the prevailing market value thereof. Of course, unless there are indications to hold otherwise, all sale transactions under registered sale deeds will be assumed to be normal sales by willing sellers to willing purchasers. Where however there is evidence or indications that the sale was not at prevailing fair market value, it has to be ignored. But auction sales stand on a different footing. When purchasers start bidding for a property in an auction, an element of competition enters into the auction. Human ego, and desire to do better and excel other competitors, leads to competitive bidding, each trying to outbid the others. Thus in a well advertised open auction sale, where a large number of bidders participate, there is always a tendency for the price of the auctioned property to go up considerably. On the other hand, where the auction sale is by banks or financial institutions, courts, etc. to recover dues, there is an element of distress, a cloud regarding title, and a chance of litigation, which have the effect of dampening the enthusiasm of bidders and making them cautious, thereby depressing the price. There is therefore every likelihood of auction price being either higher or lower than the real market price, depending upon the nature of sale. As a result, courts are wary of relying upon auction sale transactions when other regular traditional sale transactions are available while determining the market value of the acquired land.  2007(7) SCC 609 - Ref.   [Para 6]\n\nBut where an open auction sale is the only comparable sale transaction available (on account of proximity in situation and proximity in time to the acquired land), the court may have to, with caution, rely upon the price disclosed by such auction sales, by providing an appropriate deduction or cut to off-set the competitive-hike in value.

When the Government decided to entertain such application submitted by the land owners, the second stage was to give a show cause notice to the beneficiary setting out the proposed reasons for deletion so that the beneficiary has an opportunity to put up its defence, opposing the deletion and sufficient time is provided to present its response in reply to the said show cause notice.  Then, comes a stage of hearing to the respective parties and this hearing must reflect as proceedings recorded by authority who has heard the respective parties.  This cannot be by any stretch of imagination the notes or submissions made by some Desk Officer or any other officer in the ministry or the department concerned.  These proceedings so recorded must reflect the contentions of the respective parties, the reasoning by the competent authority to accept or reject such contentions and the findings in support of the order of deletion or the order of rejecting the applications which demonstrate the application of mind by the competent authority alone.  The next stage would be the publication of the said order and the publication within the meaning of Article 166 (1) of the Constitution.  This publication/communication must satisfy the requirements inasmuch as the order must be published/ communicated expressly in the name of the Governor.

Moreover, the potentiality has to be directly relatable to the capacity of the acquired land to produce agricultural products or, its market value relatable to the known methods of computation of compensation which we shall shortly proceed to discuss. The second circumstance specified in Section 23(1) to be considered by the Court in determining compensation is the damage sustained by the person on account of any standing crops or trees which may be on the land at the time of the Collector's taking possession thereof. Even from a reasonable practicable view it has to be understood that the compensation which is payable to the claimants is in relation to the acquired land, the standing crops or trees and what they earn from the agricultural crops or fruits or trees on the agricultural land. To extend the benefit for the purposes of compensation, considering that the fruits grown on the agricultural land would be converted into Jam or any other eatable products will not be a relevant consideration within the scheme of the Act. The purpose is not to connect the acquisition to remote factors which may have some bearing or some connection with the agricultural activity being carried on, on the land in question. Such an approach by the Court is neither permissible nor prudent, as it would be opposed to the legislative intent contained under the provisions of Sections 23 and 24 of the Act. Similarly, another example which can usefully be referred at this stage itself is that a person growing sugarcane on the land, which is acquired, would be entitled to the compensation of the land with reference to the agricultural yield and/or capitalization thereof only in respect of sugarcane. The rate of sugarcane in the market may be a relevant consideration but the fluctuating prices of sugar and other allied products in the market will be of no relevance in determining the fair market value of the acquired land. It is the option of the agriculturist to give his sugarcane crop for manufacture of sugar or gur or for any other purpose which he may choose using his business wisdom but the costing and manufacturing activity of that particular product for which the sugarcane had been supplied by him would not be, a relevant consideration for determining the fair market value of the land, whichever be the method of computation of compensation adopted by the court of competent jurisdiction.  [Para 35,37]\n\nOn proper analysis of the above stated principles and the relevant provisions of law, we have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that consequential or remote benefits occurring from an agricultural activity is not a relevant consideration for determination of the fair market value on the date of the Notification issued under Section 4(1) of the Act. It is only the direct agricultural crop produced by the agriculturist from the acquired land or its price in market at best, which is a relevant consideration to be kept in mind by the court while applying any of the known and accepted method of computation of compensation or the fair market value of the acquired land.

It means nothing more or less than an inherent political right, founded on a common necessity and interest of appropriating the property of individual members of the community to the great necessities and common good of the whole society. It embraces all cases where, by the authority of the State and for the public good, the property of an individual is taken without his consent to be devoted to some particular use, by the State itself, by a Corporation, public or private or by a private citizen for the welfare of the public.   [Para 36]\n\n'Eminent domain' is thus inherent power of a governmental entity to take privately owned property, especially land and convert it to public use, subject to reasonable compensation for the taking. The right of the State or the sovereign to its or his own property is absolute while that of the subject or citizen to his property is only paramount. The citizen holds his property subject always to the right of the sovereign to take it for a public purpose. The power of eminent domain is merely a means to an end; viz. larger public interest.  \t\t\t\t\t [Para 37,40]\n\nThe power of eminent domain does not depend for its existence on a specific grant. It is inherent and exists in every sovereign State without any recognition thereof in the Constitution or in any statute. It is founded on the law of necessity. The power is inalienable. No Legislature can bind itself or its successors not to exercise this power when public necessity demands it. Nor it can be abridged or restricted by agreement or contract.   [Para 41]\n\nWillis in his well known work 'Constitutional Law' discusses two view points as to exercise of power of eminent domain. The older and stricter view was that unless the property was dedicated for user by the public at large or a considerable section thereof, it would not be for public use or for public purpose. The modern and more liberal view, however, is that it is not an essential condition of public use that the property should be transferred to public ownership or for public user and it is sufficient that the public derives advantage from the scheme.

Section 74 of the Evidence Act states which documents are public documents. Sub-section 2 of Section 74 of the Evidence Act says that the public records kept (in any State) of private documents are public documents. The sale deeds are private documents. Section 77 of the Evidence Act says that certified copies of a public document may be produced in proof of the contents of the public documents or parts of the public documents of which they purport to be copies. A certified copy of a sale deed is admissible in evidence under Section 77 of the Evidence Act and the certified copy can be produced in proof of the contents of its contents. 2001(4) ALL MR 544 (S.C.) - Rel. on.  [Para 5,6]\n\nThe doubt, if any, which persisted as to whether the certified copy of a sale deed is admissible without calling the vendor or purchaser or the attesting witness to prove its contents has been set to rest by an amendment of the Land Acquisition Act by introduction of Section 51-A therein. The use of the words \"may be accepted\" in S.51-A does not make any difference to the facts of the case. The expression \"the certified copy may be accepted\" means that the certified copy shall ordinarily be accepted unless there are good reasons for not accepting it. Except where it is proved by adducing evidence that the document produced was fraudulent and executed for collateral purpose or there exists any other good reason to hold otherwise a certified copy of the sale deed would have to be accepted as an evidence of its contents. Neither the Land Acquisition Officer nor the Reference Court would be justified in rejecting the document on the ground that they have discretion not to accept it by reason of using of words \"may be accepted\". The words \"may be accepted\" would ordinarily mean the document shall be accepted in evidence unless there is a good and valid reason for not accepting the document. The words \"may be accepted\" do not confer unfettered discretion in the Court to reject the certified copy in evidence without good reason.  [Para 7,8]\n\nThus, therefore, the Reference Court was not right in rejecting the sale deed only on the ground that the appellant had not examined the purchaser or vendor or the attesting witness. \t\t\t [Para 9]"

But does not mean that open land abutting road has no market value or very little market value on the ground that the portion is unbuildable being a part of the set back. In cases of large piece of land the area under the set back would also be available while computing FSI (Floor Space Index) available for a building construction. Usually a certain percentage of a land can only be built upon and remaining land is to be kept open. The buildable area is to be determined on the basis of the total area of the land including the area falling under the set back area and without excluding the area under the set back. The building potential of a piece of land depends upon the total area including the area of the set back. 2009(5) ALL MR 1022 (S.C.) - Applied.  [Para 11]"

                ],
                "description": "Determination of compensation - On basis of developed exemplar transaction - Quantum of deductions fall under two parts. viz. first deductions for keeping aside land for infrastructure and second deduction for expense likely to be incurred in providing infrastructure development - Deduction for first and second part would be 331/3 percent each i.e. 67% in all - Further deductions for waiting period and other causes would be maximum 8% under the head deescalation - Total deductions, thus, not to exceed 75%.\n\nThe quantum of deductions (to be made from the market value determined on the basis of the developed exemplar transaction) on account of development into two components. Firstly, space/area which would have to be left out, for providing indispensable amenities like formation of roads and adjoining pavements, laying of sewers and rain/flood water drains, overhead water tanks and water lines, water and effluent treatment plants, electricity sub-stations, electricity lines and street lights, telecommunication towers etc. Besides the aforesaid, land has also to be kept apart for parks, gardens and playgrounds. Additionally, development includes provision of civic amenities like educational institutions, dispensaries and hospitals, police stations, petrol pumps etc. This \"first component\", may conveniently be referred to as deductions for keeping aside area/space for providing developmental infrastructure.\n\nSecondly, deduction has to be made for the expenditure/expense which is likely to be incurred in providing and raising the infrastructure and civic amenities referred to above, including costs for levelling hillocks and filling up low lying lands and ditches, plotting out smaller plots and the like. This \"second component\" may conveniently be referred to as deductions for developmental expenditure/ expense.  [Para 16]\n\nFor the \"first component\" under the head of \"development\", deduction of 33-1/3 percent can be made. Likewise, for the \"second component\" under the head of \"development\" a further deduction of 33-1/3 percent can additionally be made. The facts and circumstances of each case would determine the actual component of deduction, for each of the two components. Yet under the head of \"development\", the applied deduction should not exceed 67 percent. That should be treated as the upper benchmark. This would mean, that even if deduction under one or the other of the two components exceeds 33-1/3 percent, the two components under the head of \"development\" put together, should not exceed the upper benchmark.  [Para 18]\n\nA deduction could be made keeping in mind the waiting period required to raise infrastructure, as also, the waiting period for sale of developed plots and or built-up areas. This nature of deduction may be placed under the head \"waiting period\". Illustratively again, deductions could also be made in cases where the exemplar sale transaction, is of a date subsequent to the publication of the preliminary notification. This nature of deduction may be placed under the head \"de-escalation\". Likewise, deductions may be made for a variety of other causes which may arise in different cases. It is however necessary that all deductions should not cumulatively exceed the upper benchmark of 75 percent. Differences between the nature of the exemplar land and the acquired land, it should be remembered, is the reason/cause for applying deductions. Another aspect of this matter must also be kept in mind. Market value based on an exemplar sale, from which a deduction in excess of 75 percent has to be made, would not be a relevant sale transaction to be taken into consideration, for determining the compensation of the acquired land. In such a situation the exemplar land and the acquired land would be uncomparable, and therefore, there would be no question of applying the market value of one (exemplar sale) to determine the compensation payable for the other (acquired land).  [Para 19]\n\nBefore applying deductions for ascertaining the market value of the undeveloped acquired land, it would be necessary to classify the nature of the exemplar land, as also, the acquired land. This would constitute the second step in the process of determination of the correct quantum of deductions. The lands under reference may be totally undeveloped, partially developed, substantially developed or fully developed. In arriving at an appropriate classification of the nature of the lands which are to be compared, reference may be made to the developmental activities referred to by us in connection with the \"first component\", as also, the \"second component\" (in paragraph 17 above). The presence (or absence) of one or more of the components of development, would lead to an appropriate classification of the exemplar land, and the acquired land. Comparison of the classifications thus arrived, would depict the difference in terms of development, between the exemplar land and the acquired land. This exercise would lead to the final step. In the final step, the absence and presence of developmental components, based on such comparison, would constitute the basis for arriving at an appropriate percentage of deduction, necessary to balance the differential factors between the exemplar land and the acquired land.

Such powers cannot be lightly resorted to except in case of real urgency enabling the Government to take immediate possession of the land proposed to be acquired for public purpose. A public purpose, however laudable it may be by itself is not sufficient to take aid of Section 17 to use this extraordinary power as use of such power deprives a land owner of his right in relation to immovable property to file objections for the proposed acquisition and it also dispenses with the inquiry under Section 5A of the Act. The Authority must have subjective satisfaction of the need for invoking urgency clause under Section 17 keeping in mind the nature of the public purpose, real urgency that the situation demands and the time factor i.e. whether taking possession of the property can wait for a minimum period within which the objections could be received from the land owners and the inquiry under section 5A of the Act could be completed. In other words, if power under section 17 is not exercised, the very purpose for which the land is being acquired urgently would be frustrated or defeated. Normally urgency to acquire a land for public purpose does not arise suddenly or overnight but sometimes such urgency may arise unexpectedly, exceptionally or extraordinarily depending on situations such as due to earthquake, flood or some specific time bound project where the delay is likely to render the purpose nugatory or infructuous. A citizen's property can be acquired in accordance with law but in the absence of real and genuine urgency, it may not be appropriate to deprive an aggrieved party of a fair and just opportunity of putting forth its objections for due consideration of the acquiring authority, while applying the urgency clause, the State should indeed act with due care and responsibility. Invoking urgency clause cannot be a substitute or support for the laxity, lethargy or lack of care on the part of the State Administration.   [Para 17]"

Lapsing of the acquisition of the land results in owner of the land retaining ownership right in the property and according to us it is a substantive right accrued to the owner of the land, and that in view thereof we feel Section 11-A of the L.A. Act is part of the law which creates and defines right, not adjective law which defines method of enforcing rights. It is a law that creates, defines and regulates the right and powers of the party.

This essentially must depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case.  Onus to prove entitlement to receive higher compensation is upon the claimants.\n\nEach case of determination of market value of the acquired land has to be decided on its own facts, existing statutory guidelines stated in sections 23 and 24 of the Act and in the backdrop of judicial pronouncements controlling exercise of jurisdiction under section 18 of the Act.  The evidence led by the parties and, particularly the claimants, would have to be scrutinized so as to arrive at a just, fair and adequate compensation.  Another facet of this aspect of acquisition law is what kind of methodology the Court would adopt while arriving at a conclusion. Should it adopt capitalization method, multiple method, belting system or evolve any other method which necessarily would have to depend on record before the court.  Location and potential of the land cannot be a question of law; it will ever be a matter of fact.  The enunciated principle of law which, de hors the evidence on record, can be applied to every case, is not only improbable but is even impermissible.  It can be said that normally an irrigated land would get higher compensation than the unirrigated or jirayat land, but there can be cases where this principle is commonly appears to be true, may not be applicable.  For example irrigated agricultural land is located away from the national highway or industrial area but non-irrigated land is located adjacent to the industrial area, which is fully developed and/or is adjacent to the national or State highway.  Parties have to lead evidence to show that the lands have greater potential and value, which is higher than the agricultural land.  In those circumstances the court would have to consider the entire mater objectively and may be in all probability the bagayat land may get higher compensation than the agricultural land. Thus it cannot be stated as an universal rule that irrigated agricultural land must always get price higher or the double compensation than the non irrigated agricultural land.

Apart from nature and quality of land in the event the agricultural lands are acquired the other factors relevant therefor are also required to be considered, namely, as to whether they are irrigated or non-irrigated, extent of facilities available for irrigation, location of the land, closeness thereof from any road or highway, the evenness of land, its position in different seasons particularly in rainy season, existence of any building or structure as also the development in and around the area. A host of other factors will also have a bearing on determining the valuation of land. The mode and manner in which determination of such valuation are to be carried out would also depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case, namely, whether any deed of sale executed in respect of similarly situated land near about the date of issuance of notification under Section 4(1) of the Act is available, or in absence of any such exemplars whether the claim can be determined on yield basis or in case of an orchard on the basis of the number of fruit bearing trees and the yield therefrom. One other important factor which also should be borne in mind is that it may not be safe to rely only on an award involving a neighbouring area irrespective of the nature and quality of the land.

Act may be read literally and having regard to the ordinary meaning which can be attributed to the term \"acceptance of evidence\" relating to transaction evidenced by a sale deed, its admissibility in evidence would be beyond any question. For bringing a documentary evidence on the record, the same must not only be admissible but the contents thereof must be proved in accordance with law. But when the statute enables a court to accept a sale deed on the records evidencing a transaction, nothing further is required to be done. The admissibility of a certified copy of sale deed by itself could not be held to be inadmissible as thereby a secondary evidence has been brought on record without proving the absence of primary evidence. Even the vendor or vendee thereof is not required to examine themselves for proving the contents thereof. This, however, would not mean that the contents of the transaction as evidenced by the registered sale deed would automatically be accepted. The legislature advisedly has used the word \"may\". A discretion, therefore, has been conferred upon a court to be exercised judicially i.e. upon taking into consideration the relevant factors. (2005)12 SCC 59 - Rel. on.  [Para 22]"

                "description": "Unauthorised occupation - Mode of eviction of unauthorised occupants.\n\nThe authority of the State to evict encroachers for the benefit of the members of the first respondent Society (whose right to possession of the property is not clearly established) by the use of police force is wholly inconsistent with the rule of law. The mode of eviction of unauthorised occupants depends on the ownership of the property. In a country governed by the rule of law, even squatters can be evicted only in accordance with some procedure established by law. In the absence of any special statute dealing with the eviction of such squatters, persons seeking to evict squatters, must obtain a decree for eviction from a competent court and execute such a decree. Such a decree can be granted only if the competent court comes to the conclusion that the person seeking such a decree has a superior legal right to the possession of the property in dispute than the right of the squatter. Therefore, in our opinion, the State of Andhra Pradesh could have resorted to the summary procedure of eviction of the encroachers only if the land in dispute vests in the State and the possession of the squatters is of recent origin.\n\nEven if the land in dispute is declared surplus land under the provisions of the Act, the same can be taken possession of by the State only by following the procedure established by law which is indicated under Section 10 of the Act.

The proceedings commenced for acquisition of land upon issuing notification under Section 4(1) of the said Act can be dropped in terms of Section 48 therein, before the land vests in the Government. Once the land vests in the Government, it is not even possible to withdraw it from acquisition. For vesting of title, the manner of taking possession has to be strictly adhered to. The concept of deemed vesting of land in the Government, cannot be imported upon publication of notification under Section 4(1) of the said Act, if the possession of the land taken by the Collector dehors the provisions of the Act, continues with him upon issuance of such notification. The possession taken over in the acquisition proceedings dehors the provisions of the Act will not confer or vest the title over it in the Government merely because notification under Section 4(1) of the said Act is issued and the proceedings for acquisition of the land have commenced.

Each case has to be considered in the light of the purpose for which acquisition is sought for. It is to serve thegeneral interest of the community as opposed to the particular interest of the individual. Public purpose broadly speaking would include the purpose in which the general interest of the society as opposed to the particular interest of the individual is directly and vitally concerned. Generally the executive would be the best judge to determine whether or not the impugned purpose is a public purpose. Yet it is not beyond the purview of judicial scrutiny. The interest of a section of the society may be public purpose when it is benefited by the acquisition. The acquisition must indicate that it was towards thewelfare of people and not to benefit a private individual orgroup of individuals joined collectively. Therefore, acquisition for anything which is not for a public purpose cannot be done compulsorily. \t [Para 11]"

It amounts to transfer of resources of poor for the benefit of the rich. It amounts to permitting profiteering at the cost of livelihood and existence of a farmer. This is against the philosophy of the Constitution and in violation of guaranteed fundamental rights of equality and right to property and to life. What cannot be done directly cannot be done indirectly also. This apart, if State is to be party to directly or indirectly select beneficiary of State largess - which in present fact situation the State certainly is - objectivity and transparency are essential elements of exercise of public power which are required to be followed. It is patent that the State has enabled the builder to enter the field after initiation of acquisition to seek colonization on the land covered by acquisition. In absence of State's action, it was not possible for the builder to enter into the transactions in question which was followed by withdrawal from acquisition. But for assurance from some quarters, the builder could not have made investment nor land owners could have executed the transactions in question. Such fraudulent and clandestine exercise of power by the State is not permitted by law.\t [Para 14,15,27]"

Site selection is set out in Schedule III.  Amongst various other requirements, it is provided that in areas falling under the jurisdiction of the development authorities, it shall be the responsibility of such development authorities to identify the land fill sites and hand over the sites to the concerned municipal authority for development, operation and maintenance. Elsewhere this responsibility shall lie with the concerned municipal authority. The requirement is that the site must be selected taking into consideration and/or examination of environmental issues.  That necessarily has to be done before a notification under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act is issued. If the land belongs to private owners, a public body or its officers cannot or could not enter on the land without the permission of the said authorities. It is only when the notification is issued under Section 4(1) of the Act, is it then lawful, by virtue of sub-section (2) for any officer either generally or specially authorised to enter upon and survey the land, dig or bore in the sub-soil, and to do all other acts necessary to ascertain whether the land is adapted for such purpose.  If we bear this aspect in mind, the contention as urged on behalf of the petitioners that the permission is required even before the notification under Section 4 of the land Acquisition Act is issued, will have to be negatived.  The inspection of the site and whether it would conform to the requirements and satisfy the environmental issues, can only be done if the officer of Respondent No.1 or officers of the Development Authority can enter upon the land after the issue of the notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act. A reading of Rule 4 of the Solid Waste Rules would also make it clear that the application in Form-I is for grant of authorisation for setting up waste processing and disposal facility including the landfills. The definition of landfill, which includes not only the disposal of residual solid wastes but also putting up of a facility. In other words, something that is already done on the land, and consequently the authorisation contemplated by Form I, can also contemplate a case where the land is not yet taken in possession by Respondent No.7. Therefore there was no requirement on the Development Authority or the Municipal Authority to take authorisation before a notification under Section 4(1) of the Land Acquisition Act was issued.

                "description": "Acquisition of land - Market value - Determination of - Sale instances of comparable lands - Method of determination of market rate on basis of sale instances of comparable lands is the proper method.\n\nMethod of determination of market rate on the basis of sale instances of comparable lands is the proper method.  The reference Court also adopted that method for determination of market rate.  However, grievance from both the sides is that the evidence about sale instances has not been considered properly.  One of the contention raised on behalf of the claimant is that the reference Court without considering the sale instances and without recording any reasons discarded that evidence observing that the prices shown are exorbitant.  On behalf of acquiring body also contention is raised that sale instances brought on record are not considered.  In view of these rival contentions the evidence adduced before the reference Court oral as well as documentary requires consideration.  The claimants produced on record certified copies of sale deeds at Exhs.25 to 29.  Out of 5 sale instances, sale transaction under Exhs.27 to 29 are of the lands located in Beed Taraf Bobde area and other two are from different locality known as Taraf Pingale.  On behalf of the acquiring body as many as twenty certified copies of the sale deeds were produced on record.  Out of the said twenty sale transactions the transactions under Exhs.33 to 38 are for the year 1999 and remaining sale instances are for the years 2000 and 2001.  The market rates as well as the sale instances within proximate time of the date of notification under Section 4 of the Act are relevant.  The sale instances for the years 2000 and 2001 need no consideration when the sale instances for the year 1999 which are within proximate time of date of notification under Section 4 are available on record.  So far as the sale instances brought on record by claimants, the reference Court in paragraph 10 of the judgment observed that sale transactions under Sale deeds at Exhs.25 to 27 are prior to the date of notification under Section 4(1) of the Act.  The sale deeds at Exhs.28 and 29 are observed to be the sale instances after the date of notification under Section 4 of the Act.  The date of notification under Section 4 in the present case is 2/12/1999 and sale deeds at Exhs.28 and 29 are dated 10/2/2000 and 30/12/2000.  Sale deed at Exh.25 is dated 15/10/1998 and transactions under Exhs.26 and 27 are dated 19/5/99 and 30/9/99.  So these sale transactions are prior to the notification under Section 4 and also within the proximate time.  In respect of sale transactions of which the acquiring body placed reliance, it has been rightly observed that the transactions under sale deeds Exhs.33 to 38 are the transactions in the proximate time of date of notification and relevant.  It is for the Court to examine those sale transactions to ascertain as to whether those can be said to be comparable sale instances for the purpose of determination of market rate. On perusal of sale deed Exh.25 we noticed that the property under this sale deed bearing survey no.173 is located in Pingale Taraf area.  It is a sale transaction of a house property.  So this sale transaction which is a transaction of plot alongwith a house structure cannot be said to be a comparable sale instance of the land acquired.\n\nOther 2 sale deeds are post-notification sale deeds, though they are from Taraf Bobade area.  No doubt it is not an absolute rule that the sale transactions of the lands situated at long distance cannot be treated to be comparable sale instances.  Even post-notification transaction also can be taken into consideration with some allowances of deductions because of time factor.  However, it must be shown that the said lands are the comparable lands and are having same advantage and other amenities.  However, no such evidence is laid before the reference Court though sale deeds are produced on record by claimant.  The documents by themselves do not assist the claimant to prove the market rate of the lands at the time of date of notification under Section 4 of the Act, in absence of evidence of similarity in quality and similar amenities.  Though acquiring body produced on record 20 certified copies of sale instances only the sale transactions under Exhs.33 to 38 are within the proximate time of date of notification.  No evidence is laid on behalf of the acquiring body also to show that these sale transactions are also of comparable lands.  AIR 1996 SC 531 and 1996(2) SCC 583 - Ref. to.   [Para 12,15]"

The SLAO accepting the potentiality of the land had granted compensation on square meter basis however, without there being any deduction towards development charges.  He has determined the market rate at Rs.107/- per Sq.Mt., considering the location of the land.  It appears that he has collected some information of sale instances and on that basis as well as market rate determined in another land acquisition proceeding SLAO determined the market rate.  Learned Advocate Shri. A. S. Bajaj submitted that the material collected by the S.L.A.O. cannot be considered by reference Court unless that was brought on record before the Reference Court.  This contention raised by Shri. Bajaj needs to be considered at this stage.  The award is a public document.  Same is produced before reference Court while challenging the market rate as unreasonable or inadequate.  No doubt, the reference Court needs to record finding on the issue of market rate on the basis of material available before it.  For the purpose of acertaining the reasonableness of the market rate whether it is reasonable and adequate, the award needs to be placed before the Court.  The mandate under Section 25 imposes restriction not to grant compensation less than awarded by SLAO.  In view of provisions under Section 25 the market rate determined is binding on the acquiring body as well as on the reference Court though reference Court may enhance the same on the basis of material placed before him by the claimant but cannot reduce it.  In view of these facts, contention raised on behalf of acquiring body that the material referred in the award cannot be considered is devoid of any merit.  \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 21]"

The award of interest under Section 28 is discretionary power vested in the Court and it has to be exercised in a judicious manner and not arbitrarily. The use of the word \"may\" in Section 28 does not confer any arbitrary discretion on the Court to disallow interest for no valid or proper reasons. Normally, Court awards interest if it enhances the compensation in excess of the amount awarded by the Collector, unless there are exceptional circumstances.

In making order for costs under Section 27(1), the court may have regard to the provisions of Section 35 C.P.C. Analysing sub-section (2) of Section 27, it appears to consist of three parts, viz., (i) When the award of the Collector is not upheld, the costs shall ordinarily be paid by the collector as directed by the Court; (ii) the court is not bound to do so in every case. If the court forms opinion that the claim of the claimant is extravagant or that he was so negligent in putting his case before the Collector, then the court may make a different order as regards costs and (iii) the court may in such cases direct, that some deduction be made from the costs of the claimant or that he should pay a part of the Collector's costs.

The characteristic of a freehold tenure is that there is inheritability and transferability as a matter of right. In case of a land held by a Communidade, there is no defect in the title or ownership of the Communidade, but the restriction is on transferring the land held by the Communidade by way of sale, lease or exchange. Restriction is that such a transfer by way of sale cannot be made without prior sanction. There is no complete prohibition against effecting such transfer. In case of an insolvency of Communidade, there is a power to sell land of Communidade. However, there is a general power vesting in a Communidade by virtue of Article 30 of the Code to transfer its land by sale, lease or exchange with the sanction.\n\nWhile assessing the market value for the purpose of Section 23 of the said Act of 1894 by comparison method, the test adopted is what a prudent and genuine buyer will offer as a price of the acquired land. In case of a land, which is not freehold in the sense that a transfer thereof cannot be effected without sanction of the authorities, a willing bona fide buyer may not offer the same price, which he may offer in respect of a comparable freehold land as the buyer will be conscious of the fact that there are restrictions on transferability or that the authority empowered to sanction sale may impose some conditions. Therefore, he may offer to some extent a lesser price to the land having such restrictions. However, it cannot be said that the sale instance of a freehold land which is otherwise comparable to the acquired land cannot afford a basis to determine the market value of a land, which is having restrictions on transfer.\n\nIn case of a land held by a Communidade, the restriction on transfer will be one of the negative factors, which will have to be considered while fixing the market value. Taking into consideration the said negative factor, some deduction will have to be made depending upon the facts of a particular case while fixing the market value on the basis of a comparable sale instance of a free-hold land.

It would depend upon the facts of an individual case. In case the land is fallow and barren and does not have any structure or crop on it, symbolic possession may meet the requirement of law. However, this would not be the position in case crop is standing on the land or a kachha or pacca structure has been raised on such land. In that case, actual physical possession is required to be taken. There may be a case where the acquiring authority is in possession of the land, as the same has already been requisitioned under any law or the property is in possession of a tenant, in such a case symbolic possession qua the tenure holder would be sufficient. In the instant case, in view of the fact that land in dispute is an agricultural land and has 167 dwelling houses, law in fact requires taking over the actual physical possession.  [Para 124,125]"

At the same time, the developments that have taken place, when the reference was being decided, cannot be considered.  The purpose for which the land was acquired cannot form a basis for determining the market price in view of the bar under section 24 (Fifthly) of the Land Acquisition Act.  The Reference Court was required to decide the applications for higher compensation strictly within the ambit of sections 23 and 24 of the Land Acquisition Act and it did not have the power to innovate a reasonable method by taking into consideration the developments that were noticed on the date of inspection.  The method invented by the Reference Court in determining the market price is not only speculative in nature but, in fact, it suffers from conjectures and surmises.  It is evident that the Reference Court treated itself as a Writ Court.  When the parties had placed on record evidence of comparative sale instances the Reference Court ought to have considered the said evidence and set out reasons for not considering the same.  The methodology adopted by the Reference Court could not be sustained when the comparable sale instances were placed on record.  If these sale instances could not be called as comparable sale instances, the Reference Court was required to record reasons therefor.  AIR 1996 SC 1565 and 1996(3) SCC 124 - Referred to.  [Para 19]"

Not only this, the appellant executed agreement for facilitating the acquisition of land in lieu of payment of a sum of rupees more than 5 crores. The Estate Agent engaged by the appellant had promised that it will get the notifications issued under Sections 4(1) and 6(1) within four months and three months respectively. The huge amount which the appellant had agreed to pay to the Estate Agent had no co-relation with the services provided by it. Rather, the amount was charged by the Estate Agent for manipulating the State apparatus and facilitating the acquisition of land and sanction of layout etc. without any obstruction. Such an agreement is clearly violative of Section 23 of the Contract Act. Held High Court did not commit any error by relying upon the judgment in 1st H.M.T case (1995) 2 SCC 677 for declaring that the acquisition was not for a public purpose.  [Para 29]"

The exercise of power by the government under Section 48(1) of the Act must be made known to the public at large so that those interested in accomplishment of the public purpose for which the land is acquired or the concerned company may question such withdrawal by making representation to the higher authorities or by seeking court's intervention. If the decision of the Government to withdraw from the acquisition of land is kept secret and is not published in the official gazette, there is every likelihood that unscrupulous land owners, their agents and wheeler-dealers may pull strings in the power corridors and clandestinely get the land released from acquisition and thereby defeat the public purpose for which the land is acquired. Similarly, the company on whose behalf the land is acquired may suffer incalculable harm by unpublished decision of the Government to withdraw from the acquisition.   [Para 27]"

It is beyond any cavil that the price of the land which a willing and informed buyer would offer would be different in the cases where the owner is in possession and enjoyment of the property and in the cases where he is not.\n\nMarket value is ordinarily the price the property may fetch in the open market if sold by a willing seller unaffected by the special needs of a particular purchase. Where definite material is not forthcoming either in the shape of sales of similar lands in the neighbourhood at or about the date of notification under Section 4(1) or otherwise, other sale instances as well as other evidences have to be considered.\n\nThe amount of compensation cannot be ascertained with mathematical accuracy. A comparable instance has to be identified having regard to the proximity from time angle as well as proximity from situation angle. For determining the market value of the land under acquisition, suitable adjustment has to be made having regard to various positive and negative factors vis-a-vis the land under acquisition by placing the two in juxtaposition. The positive and negative factors are as under:\n\nWhereas a smaller plot may be within the reach of many, a large block of land will have to be developed preparing a layout plan, carving out roads, leaving open spaces, plotting out smaller plots, waiting for purchasers and the hazards of an entrepreneur. Such development charges may range between 20% and 50% of the total price."

In all fairness, the State should have brought on record the requisite information, viz., the nature of the crop, the annual average yield, availability of irrigation facilities, etc. so as to enable the reference court to arrive at a correct decision in regard to grant of compensation under the Act.  The potentiality of a land for the purpose of development as also for building purposes would depend upon a large number of factors. For the said purpose, the court may not only have to bear in mind the purpose for which the lands were sought to be acquired but also the subsequent events to some extent. In a case of this nature the court may proceed on the presumption that such a vast tract of land, viz., 96 villages were sought to be acquired at the same time for construction of New Bombay. Development in the entire area was not possible at one point of time. Development of the area must have taken place in phases. Not the price of the land may skyrocket depending upon the development as also future potentiality. [Para 13,16]"

In other words the provisions of sections 18 to 28 are also made applicable while considering the reference under section 28(A).  What this would mean is that the provisions of section 25(4) and (5) as they stood before the amendment, would also be applicable in those cases where the amended provisions of the Act are not applicable.  That would mean that under section 25, the Reference Court for sufficient reason can allow party to make a claim, even if the claim had not been made.  It will also mean that it will be open to the party to make a higher claim, if the claim had been restricted and for the Reference Court to consider whether it should be allowed.  It would not be possible to construe the power under section 25 to only those cases where no claim had been made.  To give effect to the provisions, it would cover both situations, where either claimant had not made a claim or had made a lesser claim.  In such cases the reference Court for sufficient cause can allow the party to make the claim.  It is, therefore, clear that there was discretion in the reference court even prior to the amendment to allow a party to make claim if not made in reply to a notice served under Section 9 or to permit a higher claim than that made in a reply to the notice under Section 9 of the Act.

References under Section 18 and Section 30 are conceptually different from each other. The decree in terms of Section 18 is different from the one in terms of Section 30. Remedy available in terms of Section 55 of the Act is against a decree. The question whether reference court can deal with the question covered by Section 30 of the Act in a reference made under Section 18 of the Act and vice versa has been the subject matter of judicial determination. In (Rai) Pramatha Nath Mullick Bahadur Vs. Secry. of State (AIR 1930 PC 64) it was held that the jurisdiction of the courts under the Act is a special one and strictly limited to the terms of Sections 18, 20 and 21. It only arises when a specific objection has been taken to the Collector's Award and it is confined to a consideration of that objection. Therefore, it is certain that when the only objection taken is to the amount of compensation that alone is the matter referred and the Court has no jurisdiction to determine or consider anything beyond it.

[Para 12]\n\nEvery tribunal of limited jurisdiction is not only entitled but bound to determine whether the matter in which it is asked to exercise its jurisdiction comes within the limits of its special jurisdiction and whether the jurisdiction of such tribunal is dependent on the existence of certain facts or circumstances. Its obvious duty is to see that these facts and circumstances exist to invest it with jurisdiction, and where a tribunal derives its jurisdiction from the statute that creates it and that statute also defines the conditions under which the tribunal can function, it goes without saying that before that tribunal assumes jurisdiction in a matter, it must be satisfied that the conditions requisite for its acquiring seisin of that matter have in fact arisen.

                "description": "Public purpose - Determination - Discretion of State, exercise of - Judicial review - Scope - Primarily it is for State to decide whether there exists public purpose or not - Decision of State though not beyond judicial scrutiny, a writ court shall not interfere unless such power exercised mala fide or for collateral purposes or purported action, de hors the Act, irrational or otherwise unreasonable or so-called purpose is 'no public purpose' at all and fraud on statute is apparent - A writ court, while exercising powers under Articles 32, 226 or 136 of Constitution, cannot substitute its own judgment for judgment of Government as to what constitutes 'public purpose'.\n\nThe State of Andhra Pradesh in the background of 'World Tourism Organization Report' and 'Vision 2020 Document' took a policy decision for the development of the City of Hyderabad. For the said purpose, it decided to establish an Integrated Project which would make Hyderabad a major Business-cum-Leisure Tourism Infrastructure Centre for the State. The project is both structurally as well as financially integrated. It is to be implemented through Andhra Pradesh Infrastructure and Investment Corporation (APIIC) which has taken all steps to make Hyderabad a world-class business destination. APIIC is an instrumentality of State and works as 'Nodal Agency' developing the project which would facilitate socio-economic progress of the State by generating revenues, weeding out unemployment and bringing new avenues and opportunities for public at large. Development of infrastructure is legal and legitimate 'public purpose' for exercising power of eminent domain. Simply because a Company has been chosen for fulfillment of such public purpose does not mean that the larger public interest has been sacrificed, ignored or disregarded. It will also not make exercise of power bad, mala fide or for collateral purpose vitiating the proceedings.   [Para 166,168]\n\nIt is clearly established in this case that the Infrastructure Development Project conceived by the State and executed under the auspices of its instrumentality (APIIC) is one covered by the Act. The Joint Venture Mechanism for implementing the policy, executing the project and achieving lawful public purpose for realizing the goal of larger public good would neither destroy the object nor vitiate the exercise of power of public purpose for development of infrastructure. The concept of joint venture to tap resources of private sector for infrastructural development for fulfillment of public purpose has been recognized in foreign countries as also in India in several decisions of this Court.   [Para 170]\n\nThe entire amount of compensation is to be paid by State agency (APIIC) which also works as nodal agency for execution of the project. It is primarily for the State to decide whether there exists public purpose or not. Undoubtedly, the decision of the State is not beyond judicial scrutiny. In appropriate cases, where such power is exercised mala fide or for collateral purposes or the purported action is de hors the Act, irrational or otherwise unreasonable or the so-called purpose is 'no public purpose' at all and fraud on statute is apparent, a writ-court can undoubtedly interfere. But except in such cases, the declaration of the Government is not subject to judicial review. In other words, a writ court, while exercising powers under Articles 32, 226 or 136 of the Constitution, cannot substitute its own judgment for the judgment of the Government as to what constitutes 'public purpose'.

It is not the case set up that compensation had not been paid to purchasers/owners. The only case set up is that physical possession has not been taken and proceedings of taking over possession have been questioned to take advantage of provisions under S. 24(2) of the Act of 2013. Whereas, averment in the writ petition itself indicates that possession had been taken over in the year 2000 and that unauthorized colonies have come up in the area. Thus, it is clear that possession, if any, is illegal, and in fact, the actual physical possession had been taken, and re-entering in possession in an unauthorized manner can confer no right. There is nothing to doubt that actual physical possession had been taken in 2000. Thus, S. 24(2) is not attracted in the case. \n\tEven otherwise, proviso to S. 24(2) does not recognize a purchaser after S. 4 notification inasmuch as it provides that where an award has been made, and the compensation in respect of a majority of land holdings has not been deposited in the account of the beneficiaries, then, all beneficiaries specified in the notification for acquisition issued under the Act of 1894, shall be entitled to compensation under the provisions of the Act of 2013. The proviso makes it clear that in case of compensation concerning the majority of landholding has not been deposited, then recorded owner(s) at the time of issuance of notification under S. 4 of the Act of 1894 shall have the right to receive the compensation. Purchasers after S. 4 notification have not been given the right to receive the higher compensation under the provisions contained in the act of 2013. Such a person who has purchased after S. 4 notification, as sale deed is void under the Act of 1894, cannot claim rehabilitation and resettlement as per policy envisaged under the Act of 2013, as his land has not been acquired, but he has purchased a property which has already been acquired by the State Government, he cannot claim even higher compensation, as per proviso to S. 24(2) under the Act of 2013. The transaction of sale, effected after S. 4 notification, is void, is ineffective to transfer the land, such incumbents cannot invoke the provisions of S. 24. It would be unfair and profoundly unjust and against the policy of the law to permit such a person to claim resettlement or claim the land back as envisaged under the Act of 2013.

Therefore, if the offence is disclosed to be made out under the provisions of the Act, an accused cannot be charged for the same offence under Chapter XIII of IPC. Reading of Section 51 of the Act makes it clear that the provisions of IPC insofar as they relate to offences with regard to weight or measure, shall not apply to any offence which is punishable under the Act. Therefore, the provisions of IPC which relate to offences with regard to weight and measure as contained in Chapter XIII of IPC alone will not apply. No person can be charged for an offence relating to weight or measure falling under Chapter XIII of IPC in view of the provisions of the Act.\n\n\tThe scheme of the Act is for the offences for use of weights and measures which are non-standard and for tampering with or altering any standards, secondary standards or working standards of any weight or measure. The Act does not foresee any offence relating to cheating as defined in Section 415 of IPC or the offences under Sections 467, 468 and 471 of IPC. Similarly, an act performed in furtherance of a common intention disclosing an offence under Section 34 is not covered by the provisions of the Act. An offence disclosing a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence which is punishable under Section 120-B IPC is also not an offence under the Act. Since such offences are not punishable under the provisions of the Act, therefore, the prosecution for such offences could be maintained since the trial of such offences is not inconsistent with any of the provisions of the Act.

Since, the petitioner-company had nominated the Director under Section 49(2) and since, the nomination was certified by the Director of the Legal Metrology, only the nominated Director and the Company could have been proceeded against and punished. If, the other Directors could not have been proceeded against under Section 49(1) after the nomination of the Director under Section 49(2), the imposition of the compounding charges on the other Directors of the Company was not justified.

The licence for repair of weight and measure is issued under Section 23 of the Act in form LD3, as prescribed under Schedule III in accordance with Rule 6(3). The licence issued to the repairer provides for conditions of licence, as has been prescribed under Rule 8. Under Rule 8 (1)(f)(i), it is the responsibility of the repairer to present the weight or measure duly repaired to the Legal Metrology Officer for undertaking verification, stamping and sealing, as specified in Rule 13, before delivery to the user; and in view of Rule 8(1)(f)(ii), the repairer has to present to the Legal Metrology Officer weights or measures which are repaired before the date on which the verification falls due, for verification, stamping and sealing before delivery to the user.\n\n\tThus, it is the duty under the conditions of licence to ensure that the repaired weight or measure is duly verified, stamped or sealed before delivering the same to the user. It is obvious that the repairer, whose duty is to deliver duly verified, stamped and sealed weight and measure to the user, cannot get the verification, stamping or sealing done from the Legal Metrology Officer without making payment of verification fees. It is illogical to contend that the licensed repairer must deliver duly stamped, verified or sealed weight and measure after repairing to its user, but he shall not deposit the fees for verification. Under Rule 12 of the Rules, the repairer is expected to maintain the records and registers in appropriate form set out in Schedule VIII and also submit periodical reports or returns as may be specified. The form set out in Schedule VIII contains a column in respect of verification fees. If, at all, a repairer is to maintain the records also in respect of verification fees, it would be illogical to contend that he cannot collect and deposit verification fees with the appropriate authority on behalf of the owner or user of the weights and measures. In the event of rejection of application for verification of weight and measure, the Legal Metrology Officer is expected to issue a communication prescribed in Schedule X of the Rules and such communication shall have to be issued to the person who has presented such weight or measure for verification. It is, thus, clear that in the event of rejection of request for verification, notice shall have to be issued to the person who has presented the weight or measure for verification including the repairer of such weights and measures so as to enable him to remove the deficiencies within seven days from the date of receipt of such notice. If, at all, the repairer is expected to remove the deficiencies within seven days from the date of receipt of notice in form Schedule X, it is unreasonable to infer that such licensed repairer is not entitled to deposit the fees for verification with the authorised officer on behalf of user of weights and measures.\n\n\tUnder Rule 16 of the Rules, which relates to collection of fees and deposit into the Treasury, the Legal Metrology Officer, before commencing the work of verification, shall have to inform the person concerned of the fees payable by him under these rules and shall receive the same in the manner as specified by the controller and issue a receipt in the form approved by the Controller. The \"person concerned\" shall obviously be either the person who is authorised to tender the weight and measure under repair for verification with the Legal Metrology Officer or the user thereof. Thus, there is no prohibition under Rule 16 also for deposit of fees by the licensed repairer.\t\t\t\t [Para 17,18,19,20]"

On a fair reading of the section it is clear that it is restrictive in nature. It lays down three conditions for applicability of the second part of the section namely :- (a) the statement must be on a material matter or must suppress facts which it was material to disclose; (b) the suppression must be fraudulently made by the policy holder; and (c) the policy holder must have known at the time of making the statement that it was false or that it suppressed facts which it was material to disclose. Mere inaccuracy of (or) falsity in respect of some recitals or items in the proposal is not sufficient. The burden of proof is on the insurer to establish these circumstances and unless the insurer is able to do so there is no question of the policy being avoided on ground of misstatement of facts. The contracts of insurance including the contract of life assurance are contracts uberrima fides and every fact of material must be disclosed, otherwise, there is good ground for rescission of the contract. The duty to disclose material facts continues right up to the conclusion of the contract and also implies any material alteration in the character of the risk which may take place between the proposal and its acceptance. If there are any misstatements or suppression of material facts, the policy can be called in question. For determination of the question whether there has been suppression of any material facts it may be necessary to also examine whether the suppression relates to a fact which is in the exclusive knowledge of the person intending to take the policy and it could not be ascertained by reasonable enquiry by a prudent person.   [Para 12]\n\nIn course of time the Corporation has grown in size and at present it is one of the largest public sector financial undertakings. The public in general and crores of policyholders in particular look forward to prompt and efficient service from the Corporation. Therefore the authorities in-charge of management of the affairs of the Corporation should bear in mind that its credibility and reputation depend on its prompt and efficient service. Therefore, the approach of the Corporation in the matter of repudiation of a policy admittedly issued by it should be one of extreme care and caution. It should not be dealt with in a mechanical and routine manner.  [Para 16]"

                "description": "Contract of life insurance - Proposal of life insurance along with passport as proof of age submitted on 20-4-1981 - Corporation issuing suspense memo on 2-5-1981 acknowledging receipt of money towards first premium - Corporation asking for standard proof of age which was submitted in the form of School Leaving Certificate on 18-5-1981 - Insured dying on 21-5-1981 - Held, there was concluded contract on 18-5-1981 i.e. prior to death of insured though it was communicated to plaintiff belatedly on 26-6-1981.\n\nThe Acceptance letter indicates that the defendant Insurance Company has accepted the table 14 term 29 premiums. This clearly is on the basis of the School Leaving Certificate which was received by the Defendant company on 18th May, 1981. It must therefore necessarily be presumed that the contract of insurance became effective from 18th May, 1981 and not from 22nd June, 1981 as stated in the acceptance letter. In fact, according to the plaintiff, the contract of Insurance must be held to have retrospectively come into effect from the date when the proposal was submitted (i.e. 20th April, 1981). It must be remembered that the proposal of insurance along with Passport as proof of age was submitted on 20th April, 1981 and the defendants issued their suspense memorandum dated 2nd May, 1981 acknowledgment receipt of a sum of Rs.471/- towards of first premium including misc. expenses. This by itself would have amounted to concluded contract but for the Table term of insurance stated in the proposal which was 14-29. However, since the proposer had only submitted his passport, a non-standard proof, the defendants did not issue the policy requiring the plaintiff to produce standard proof as evidence of age to entitle him to table terms 14-29. The said SLC having been submitted on 28th May, 1981, there was no impediment to concluding the contract of insurance. The delay in communicating the acceptance is on the part of the Insurance Company. The insured cannot be made to suffer due to any internal delays and/or defects in the procedure in issuing insurance policy which is a formal expression of contract which had already come into existence prior to the death of the deceased proposer. The defendants company is carrying on business of assuring lives and claims an exclusive right to do so. The business of Life Insurance consists in providing social security meant for the community. The Corporation must be guided in its dealings with the public with a social sense of justice. It cannot be the Corporation's policy to raise frivolous objections to avoid policy claims. No doubt, the Corporation is governed by statute and the claims are to be processed as per the rules laid down in the Life Insurance Corporation Act. The facts as set out above clearly make out the case that there was a concluded contract of insurance prior to the death of the insured which occurred on 21st May, 1981. The defendants have communicated their acceptance of the proposal, on 26th June, 1981 though they received the SLC certificate from the plaintiff through their agent on 18th May, 1981 i.e. before the death of the proposer. Since there was a concluded contract of insurance as on 18th May, 1981 which was communicated to the plaintiff, albeit belatedly, the defendant Insurance Company is liable to honour its commitment under the contract of Insurance.

Resolution dt:30-5-2002 (Gazetted on 8-6-2002) - They have a statutory force.\n\nSection 21 of L.I.C. Act contemplates that the directions by the Central Government should be in writing and such directions should direct the LIC to discharge its functions and the same should relate to the policy involving the public interest.  In the present case, LIC in its affidavit has clearly stated \"when LIC asked for increased rent in consonance with State's policy, LIC acts in its capacity as a lessor, it is incumbent on LIC to carry on its business and manage its affairs on sound commercial principles ....\". Similarly, the LIC has also categorically stated that the \"overwhelming public interest and the interests of crores of policy holders requires us to revise rent of our properties\". If that be so, the LIC cannot turn around and say that they have no statutory force.  It would be rather anomalous when repeatedly the Central Govt. for the last 10 years has been issuing letters, circulars etc. and directing various public sector undertakings to strictly adhere to the aforesaid Guidelines and finally the Central Government even thought it fit to issue a Government Resolution on 30th May, 2002 and gazetted it on 8th June, 2002. In the above, the directions from Central Government are in writing. The LIC in its affidavits has admitted that the increase in rent is part of its business and also that there was overwhelming public interest to benefit crores of policy holders.  If that be so, all the aforesaid three criteria contained in Section 21 of LIC Act have been complied with, then the said Guidelines will have to have statutory force. A bare perusal of Section 21 indicates that LIC has to follow the guidelines issued by the Central Government, while LIC is discharging its functions under the Act.  The aforesaid Section does not mention that the Central Government will be issuing guidelines under the section.  What is important is that LIC shall be guided by the directions issued by the Central Government, while LIC is discharging its functions under that Act.   [Para 66]"
