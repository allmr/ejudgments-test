Near the area meaning near the protected monument. Any other interpretation of the provisions of Rule 31 may not be permissible. If we look at the wording of Sub-Rule 2 of Rule 31 it requires that every said notice of intention shall specify the limits of the area which is to be so declared and shall invite objections. It specifically contemplates specifications of limits of the area which is to be declared as prohibitory or regulatory area. By very nature of these rules therefore it cannot be one specification for all kinds of protected monuments. The area or the limit of area to be notified under Rule 31 must vary from protected monument to protected monument. To illustrate the prohibitory or regulated area around Shaniwarwada in Pune and that around Ajanta Caves in Ajanta cannot be the same. No purpose will be served around Ajanta caves if mining operations are to be prohibited only around area of 300 meters from Ajanta Caves. The entire hill on which caves are existing will have to be protected from mining operations which notification can issue under Rules 31 and 32 by giving limits of the area. The submission of the learned counsel therefore is liable to be accepted that there cannot be a general notification for all monuments. It is obvious that such notifications will be treating all protected monuments with one yardstick, it will be treating unequals with equals and therefore such  interpretation will be violative of protection granted by Article 14 of the Constitution.\t\t [Para 15]"

Since that is the basic requirement of law it is obvious that every such notification will be prospectively applicable whenever it is issued. Such kind of notifications were prohibitory or regulatory and measures adopted by recourse to enactment of that effect have to be prospective in their operation. Such  notifications cannot have any retrospective effect for the simple reason that it will then require demolition of construction already made in the past by recourse to legal means of making such construction. That effect to such notification is not intended by Rule 33 of the Rules of 1959. A cursory reading of the Act of 1958 and Rules of 1959 do specifically spell out the prospectivity of notifications issued thereunder. It is obviously impermissible in law to declare an ancient monument as protected monument in the year 2006 and require the demolition of all constructions made around it in the prohibitory or regulatory areas prior to even publication of the notification of intent under Rule 33 of Rules of 1959.\t [Para 19]"

It was also held that early retirement age for women from flying duties has been found favourable by majority of air-hostesses represented though the appellant/AICCA before the Court who support the age of retirement and option for ground duties given to them. Air India is a travel industry.  Pleasing, appearance, manners and physical fitness are required for members of the crew of both sexes. The air-hostesses have agreed to the early retirement age, as they need an option to go for ground duties after age of 50 years. The arguments advanced on behalf of respondent/ association, therefore, cannot be accepted that the air-hostesses are made to retire at an age earlier than males because of their failing physical appearance and it is a practice derogatory to the dignity of women. For services on board of an Aircraft both male and female members of the crew are expected to be smart, alert and agile.  The early retirement age of 50 years from flying duties for female members of the crew with an option to them to accept ground duties beyond 50 years up to the age of 58 years being a service condition agreed to and incorporated in a binding agreement or settlement and award reached with the employer, the same cannot be held to be either arbitrary or discriminatory under Articles 15 and 16 of the Constitution. It is not a discrimination against females only on ground of sex. As a result of the impugned judgment of the High Court, there would be merger of two cadres of air-hostesses and flight pursers and the air- hostesses would have to compulsorily continue on flying duties up to the age of 58 years even though for health and family reasons they are unable to fly after the age of 50 years. On the order of the High Court and after the merger of cadres of male and female employees, the females have to resign from their jobs if they do not want to fly up to the age of 58 years. The order of the High Court requires the air-hostesses to give up their more advantageous conditions of service for which they had held negotiations with the employer and obtained binding settlements and awards in the course of industrial adjudication. The decision in Nargesh Meerza's case (1981 (4) SCC 335) was binding on the High Court. The High Court was clearly wrong in holding that it had become inapplicable by passage of time. It is not open to a High Court to indirectly overrule a judgment of this Court or try to sidetrack it on the basis of subsequent events which were not relevant for pre-1997 recruits. The separation of male and female cadres with differences in their conditions of service, seniority, emoluments and allowances remained unchanged for pre- 1997 recruits and the merger has taken lace only for male and female new recruits after 1997.

                "description": "Education and practice of profession of pharmacy - Is regulated by Pharmacy Act and not by AICTE Act - Norms and regulations set by Pharmacy Council of India and other specified authorities under Pharmacy Act would have to be followed by institutions imparting education for degrees and diplomas in pharmacy - Including norms and regulations with respect to increase or decrease in intake capacity of students and decisions of PCI shall only be followed by institutions imparting degrees and diplomas in pharmacy. \n\n\tThe issue involved in the present batch of cases is regarding the applicability of the Pharmacy Act, 1948 or the AICTE Act, 1987 in relation to subject of pharmacy including the approval of courses of study, minimum standards of education required for qualification as a pharmacist, registration as a pharmacist, regulation of future professional conduct etc. The submissions on behalf of AICTE that as the AICTE Act is subsequent law and in the definition of \u201ctechnical education\u201d contained in S. 2(g), it includes \u201cpharmacy\u201d also, therefore, being a subsequent law, the same shall prevail as there will be implied repeal of the Pharmacy Act.\n\tConsidering the various provisions of the Pharmacy Act and the regulations made therein, it can be said that the Pharmacy Act is a complete Code in itself in the subject of pharmacy. The PCI has been constituted as a body empowered to regulate the education and profession of pharmacy in India. It cannot be disputed that the subject of pharmacy is a special and not a general subject. From the relevant provisions of the Pharmacy Act, the Pharmacy Act exclusively covers all areas inclusive of approval of courses, laying down course content, eligibility conditions for students as well as teachers, evaluation standards of examination, grant of registration, entry of higher qualifications in the same discipline, taking action for infamous conduct etc. It also contains a penal provision. Thus, the legislative intent in enacting the Pharmacy Act seems to be to ensure that there is seamless regulation of the profession. To carry out the objective and purpose for enacting the Pharmacy Act, the Legislature has established under the Statute the autonomous statutory authority i.e. Pharmacy Council of India. Thus it can be said that in the field of pharmacy, the Pharmacy Act is a special law. On the other hand, the AICTE Act can be said to be a general law applicable to the technical institutions and technical education. \nThe Pharmacy Act is a Special Act in the field of pharmacy and it is a complete code in itself in the field of pharmacy, the Pharmacy Act shall prevail over the AICTE Act which, as observed hereinabove, is a general statute dealing with technical education/institutions. Therefore, the submission on behalf of AICTE and/or concerned educational institutions that the AICTE Act is a subsequent law and in the definition of \u201ctechnical education\u201d it includes the \u201cpharmacy\u201d and therefore it can be said to be an \u201cimplied repeal\u201d, cannot be accepted. At his stage, it is required to be noted that as such in the AICTE Act there is no specific repeal of the Pharmacy Act, more particularly when, as observed hereinabove, the Pharmacy Act is a Special Act and the subsequent enactment of AICTE Act is general and therefore the Pharmacy Act being a Special Act must prevail. Apart from that, with regard to several aspects, there is no provision made in AICTE Act which are exclusively within the domain of PCI. Thus, it cannot be accepted that there is \u2018implied repeal\u2019 of the Pharmacy Act. \n\tIn view of the above and for the reasons stated above, it is held that in the field of Pharmacy Education and more particularly so far as the recognition of degrees and diplomas of Pharmacy Education is concerned, the Pharmacy Act, 1948 shall prevail. The norms and regulations set by the PCI and other specified authorities under the Pharmacy Act would have to be followed by the concerned institutions imparting education for degrees and diplomas in Pharmacy, including the norms and regulations with respect to increase and/or decrease in intake capacity of the students and the decisions of the PCI shall only be followed by the institutions imparting degrees and diplomas in Pharmacy.

There has to be some compelling circumstances and grounds before the court to interfere with the prescribed schedule.  It is neither so arbitrary nor so perverse, keeping in view the essential features relating to imparting education to professional courses that it should invite judicial chastisement to the extent of laying down entirely new schedule.  Merely because there has been some delay on the part of either of these authorities to timely grant or decline approval and permission to commence a course per se would not be sufficient ground for disturbing the notified schedule and timely commencement of courses.  The admission process for the current academic year is already over and the academic session has commenced.  To permit commencement of new courses after commencement of academic session or to restart the admission process all over again would neither be just nor fair in conformity with law.

The AICTE Act does not intend to be an authority either superior or to supervise or control the universities and thereby superimpose itself upon the said universities merely for the reason that it is laying down certain teaching standards in technical education or programmes formulated in any of the department or units. It is evident that while enacting the AICTE Act, the Parliament was fully alive to the existence of the provisions of UGC Act, 1956. Therefore, the definition in Section 2(h) of technical institution in AICTE Act which authorizes the AICTE to do certain things, special care has consciously and deliberately been taken to make specific mention of university, wherever and whenever the AICTE alone was expected to interact with university and its departments as well as constituent institutions and units. The role of the inspection conferred upon the AICTE vis-\u00e0-vis universities is limited to the purpose of ensuring proper maintenance of norms and standards in the technical education system so as to conform to the standard laid down by it with no further or direct control over such universities or scope for any direct action except bringing it to the notice of UGC.\n\n(2001) 8 SCC 676 Foll. \t\t    [Para 38]"

Once the Council in exercise of the statutory powers frames out a policy or issues guidelines, then such guidelines are binding on all concerned and should essentially be adhered to. The Handbook issued by the All India Council for Technical Education is a legal and binding document issued for information of the concerned parties i.e. Students and Institutions and other public. Authorities cannot be heard contrary to the specific language of the Notifications issued by the Council in exercise of its statutory power. All India Council for Technical Education enjoys supremacy in regard to grant of approval for technical courses. Once the approval is granted, the University or the other authority like Director of Technical Education cannot sit in judgment over the grant of approval but their function is not so ministerial that it has no significance in the field of education whatsoever. The Director of Technical Education is required to grant permission for commencement of courses and allot students by central counseling strictly in accordance to the merit and preference of the student. The University is expected to grant affiliation subject to satisfaction of the conditions. What they cannot do is to interfere with the approval granted by the All India Council for Technical Education or its compliance. In terms of Maharashtra University Act, 1994, the students can be admitted to the course only when the institution is affiliated to the University in terms of Section 83(6) of the Act. The Petitioners did not even care to approach these authorities for taking appropriate action in accordance with law. The attempt on behalf of the Petitioners was to completely bypass the process required to be followed on the ground that All India Council for Technical Education has granted approval. Court is unable to accept this contention as every authority, no matter how formal is its function, is expected to act in accordance with the prescribed procedure. It is for the University and the Director of Technical Education to examine various aspects and then to grant or decline permission or affiliation in accordance with law. Of course, they may be expected to act with expeditiousness, but certainly their role cannot be wiped out entirely and that too contrary to law.

Therefore, in case of Petitioner it can not be said that the Degree of M.E. by thesis obtained by him and placed as \"highly commended\" by the examiners in the year 1974, can not be considered as equivalent to First Division. The amended Section 8A of the Ordinance 93 by adding explanation to it has only clarified the equivalence of \"Grade A and B\" to First and Second Division respectively and, therefore, there is no question of the same being applicable retrospectively or prospectively. In the circumstances, the respondents case can not be said to be that of not fulfilling the minimum qualification of Ph.D. with First Class at Master level and, therefore, his selection can not be faulted with on the count of not possessing minimum qualification for being appointed on the post of Professor in Industry Institute Interaction by the VRCE.

It is difficult to agree with the contention of the Petitioners that the Staff Notice No.4/98-99 dated 27th May 1998 can be said to have introduced any change in the contract of employment. Any change in the contract of employment could only have been consensual and brought into force by both parties being ad idem thereupon, and for valuable consideration. None of the indicia of a valid contract are to be found in the present situation. Even assuming that, after the coming into force of Act 13 of 1994, the Staff Regulations continued as contractual terms of employment, we are unable to agree that by virtue of the Staff Notice No. 4/98-99 dated 27th May 1998 there was any variation in the contract of employment. At the highest, it amounted to a concession granted unilaterally by the employer, which was again unilaterally withdrawn on 18th January 1999. The contention of the Petitioners that it amounts to breach of contract by the first Respondent - State within the meaning of Article 12 - and, therefore, needs to be interfered with in writ jurisdiction is without substance and needs to be rejected.

Exercise of such power to relax the requirement of the rule or regulation to such extent and to such exception and conditions as it may consider necessary for dealing with the case must be in a just and equitable manner. The essence of the Rule is the words \"causes undue hardship in any particular case\". The word \"undue hardship\" has to be given its literal meaning and should be understood on its plain language. The \"undue hardship\" is relatable to the persons appointed to all India service. It is hardship in relation to regulating the conditions of service of persons appointed to All India service. The hardship, therefore, should essentially have reference to the cadre of service, interest of the service and least individual interest. The State Government in its proposal had not made out any case of hardship either to the service or even to the individual respondents. While taking decision in exercise of its powers conferred under Rule (3) of Rule 1960, the Competent Authority is required to strike a balance between public interest/service interest and individual interest. To a private interest, interest of the service would be paramount while to the service interest, public interest would be paramount. The Government may be able to take recourse to power of relaxation or even to issue instructions to provide for a situation which is not dealt with specifically under the Rules. Even if that was the situation, still the reasons ought to be the ones which would tilt the balance of interest in favour of the order rather than against it. The Central Government or any competent authority granting approval and/or according its sanction for such purpose must do so for valid and proper reasons. The action of the State or its instrumentalities should be for reasons which are valid, just fair and reasonable. The fairplay and transparency in such an administrative or executive actions is the sine qua non to exercise of such power.  (1995)6 SCC 289 and 1980 Indlaw SC 209 - Ref. to.  [Para 29]"

Apart from conferring of power, the section regulates the manner of passing the orders of detention as well as their duration. Where the law prescribes a thing to be done in a particular manner following a particular procedure, it shall be done in the same manner following the provisions of law, without deviating from the prescribed procedure. When the provisions of Section 3 of the Act clearly mandated the authorities to pass an order of detention at one time for a period not exceeding three months only, the Government Order in the present case, directing detention of the husband of the appellant for a period of twelve months at a stretch is clear violation of the prescribed manner and contrary to the provisions of law. The Government cannot direct or extend the period of detention up to the maximum period of twelve months, in one stroke, ignoring the cautious legislative intention that even the order of extension of detention must not exceed three months at any one time. One should not ignore the underlying principles while passing orders of detention or extending the detention period from time to time. Normally, a person who is detained under the provisions of the Act is without facing trial which in other words amounts to curtailment of his liberties and denial of civil rights. In such cases, whether continuous detention of such person is necessary or not, is to be assessed and reviewed from time to time. Taking into consideration these factors, the Legislature has specifically provided the mechanism \"Advisory Board\" to review the detention of a person. Passing a detention order for a period of twelve months at a stretch, without proper review, is deterrent to the rights of the detenu. Hence, the impugned Government Order directing detention for the maximum period of twelve months straightaway cannot be sustained in law. \t\t\t\t\t      [Para 11,15,16]"

There is nothing in S.17(1), when read with the other provisions of the Act, to interdict the application of rules of arbitral institutions that the parties may have agreed to. This being the position, atleast insofar as S.17(1) is concerned, the \u201carbitral tribunal\u201d would,when institutional rules apply, include an Emergency Arbitrator, the context of S.17 \u201cotherwise requiring\u201d - the context being interim measures that are ordered by arbitrators. The same object and context would apply even to S.9(3) which makes it clear that the court shall not entertain an application for interim relief once an arbitral tribunal is constituted unless the court finds that circumstances exist which may not render the remedy provided under S.17 efficacious. Since S.9(3) and S.17 form part of one scheme, it is clear that an \u201carbitral tribunal\u201d as defined under S.2(1)(d) would not apply and the arbitral tribunal spoken of in S.9(3) would be like the \u201carbitral tribunal\u201d spoken of in S.17(1) which, would include an Emergency Arbitrator appointed under institutional rules. (Para 20)\n\nEven if Shareholders\u2019 Agreements between parties makes the SIAC Rules subject to the Arbitration Act, the said Act, properly construed, would include an Emergency Arbitrator\u2019s awards/orders, there being nothing inconsistent in the Arbitration Rules of Singapore International Arbitration Centre,(SIAC Rules) when read with the Act. (Para 22)\n\nRule 1.3 of theSIAC Rules indicates that an award of an Emergency Arbitrator is included within the ambit of these Rules, and that an Emergency Arbitrator, as defined, means an arbitrator appointed in accordance with paragraph 3 of Schedule 1. This makes it clear beyond doubt that \u201carbitration\u201d mentioned in Shareholders\u2019 Agreement would include an arbitrator appointed in accordance with the SIAC Rules which, in turn,would include an Emergency Arbitrator. (Para 23)\n\nAn Emergency Arbitrator\u2019s \u201caward\u201d, i.e., order, would undoubtedly bean order which furthers these very objectives, i.e., to decongest the court system and to give the parties urgent interim relief in cases which deserve such relief. Given the fact that party autonomy is respected by the Act and that there is otherwise no interdict against an Emergency Arbitrator being appointed, it is clear that an Emergency Arbitrator\u2019s order, which is exactly like an order of an arbitral tribunal once properly constituted, in that parties have to be heard and reasons are to be given, would fall within the institutional rules to which the parties have agreed, and would consequently be covered by Section 17(1), when read with the other provisions of the Act. (Para 35)\n\nA party cannot be heard to say, after it participates in an Emergency Award proceeding, having agreed to institutional rules made in that regard,that thereafter it will not be bound by an Emergency Arbitrator\u2019s ruling. Having agreed to paragraph 12 of Schedule 1 to the SIAC Rules, it cannot lie in the mouth of a party to ignore an Emergency Arbitrator\u2019s award by stating that it is a nullity when such party expressly agrees to the binding nature of such award from the date it is made and further undertakes to carry out the said interim order immediately and without delay. (Para 36)\n\nIt cannot be said that an Emergency Arbitrator under the SIAC Rules is not an independent judicial body like an arbitral tribunal constituted under the very Rules. Rule 3 merely states that the President may appoint an Emergency Arbitrator if he determines that the SIAC should accept the application for emergency interim relief. Once the Emergency Arbitrator enters upon the reference, he is given all the powers of an arbitral tribunal under Rule 7 and is to decide completely independently of any other administrative authority under the SIAC Rules. Equally, Rule 9 does not, in any manner, impinge upon the independence of the Emergency Arbitrator as it only lays down the time frame within which an interim order or award is to be made, which time is extendable by the Registrar. The interim order or award that is finally made by the Emergency Arbitrator has only to be approved by the Registrar as to its \u201cform\u201d and not on merits. Further, Rule 10 also does not, in any manner, interfere with the independence of the decision of the Emergency Arbitrator. (Para 37)\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is a complete break with the past and is no longer to be viewed as an ouster statute but as a statute which favours the remedy of arbitration so as to de-clog civil courts which are, in today\u2019s milieu, extremely burdened. As a matter of fact, Section 5 of the Arbitration Act puts paid to the submission when it overrides all other laws for the time being in force and goes on to state that in matters governed by Part I of the Act, no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided in that Part. The Arbitration Act, therefore, turns the principle of ouster on its head when it comes to arbitration as a favoured means of resolving civil disputes. (Para 38)\n\nNo party, after agreeing to be governed by institutional rules, can participate in a proceeding before an Emergency Arbitrator and, after losing, turn around and say that the award is a nullity or coram non judice when there is nothing in the Arbitration Act which interdicts an Emergency Arbitrator\u2019s order from being made. S.17, as construed in the light of the other provisions of the Act, clearly leads to the position that such emergency award is made under the provisions of S.17(1) and can be enforced under the provisions of S.17(2). (Para 40)\n\nFull party autonomy is given by the Arbitration Act to have a dispute decided in accordance with institutional rules which can include Emergency Arbitrators delivering interim orders, described as \u201cawards\u201d. Such orders are an important step in aid of decongesting the civil courts and affording expeditious interim relief to the parties. Such orders are referable to and are made under S.17(1). (Para 41)"

Essentially, the Administrator General steps in to protect the estate of a person who has died and no person to whom any court would have jurisdiction to commit the administration of the estate has come forth. The Administrator General is authorised by law to move the High Court to obtain letters of administration. Where the property or estate of the deceased is in imminent danger, the Administrator General can be empowered by the High Court to take immediate steps to safeguard the estate. While permitting the Administrator General to apply to the High Court for the grant of letters of administration, the law allows any other individual to appear and establish a claim before the High Court. Where a claim to probate or letters of administration in preference to the Administrator General is established, an order of revocation can be passed by the High Court. Such adjudicatory functions are entrusted to the High Court. The Administrator General, as a public official, is conferred with duties and obligations to secure and safeguard the administration of the estate left behind by a deceased individual in the circumstances adverted to in the statute. The legislation has not reserved a judicial power to the Administrator General. Parliament in its wisdom has made provisions to ensure that estates are not frittered away upon the death of persons who do not leave behind legal heirs, by allowing the Administrator General to invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court to safeguard such estates. The conferment of adjudicatory functions upon the High Court safeguards against an abuse of power and facilitates an adjudication of private claims. \t   [Para 23]"

For DIAL, for the following reasons - (i) Delhi International Airport Pvt. Ltd. (DIAL) could not have entered into a contract with Airport Authority of India (AAI) without approval of the Central Government according to the mandate of Section 12A of the AAI Act. In this view of the matter, it is abundantly clear that DIAL functions \"under the authority\" of the Central Government;\n\n(ii) AAI clearly acts under the authority of the Central Government and DIAL acts under the authority of AAI because of its contract with DIAL. Then it can be logically stated that DIAL works under the authority of the Central Government; \n\n(iii) The Central Government has given AAI responsibility for overseeing the airports. To fulfil its obligations, AAI contracted with DIAL. However, it is clear that DIAL's work \"concerns\" AAI, if DIAL does not perform its work properly or adequately, then AAI will be breaching its statutory obligation and would be responsible for the consequences.\n\n(iv) AAI is under an obligation to follow the directions of the Central Government and if DIAL has admittedly assumed those obligations through the Operation, Mahagement Development Agreement (OMDA), then DIAL is presumably also obligated to follow such directions. Again, a contrary interpretation would allow AAI to circumvent the Central Government's exercise of authority over its work merely by contracting it out to third party (DIAL).\n\n(ix) Under Section 12(2) of the AAI Act, AAI is obliged to provide air traffic service and air transport service at the airport. DIAL admits that AAI has transferred all of its responsibilities at the airports with the exception of certain reserved functions. Since industries concerning air transport service function under the authority of the Central Government, and since AAI has transferred its \"air transport service\" responsibilities to DIAL, the Central Government must be held to be the appropriate Government for DIAL. \n\n(viii) The privatization of the airports does not mean that the \"appropriate government\" cannot be the Central Government. According to the Constitution Bench judgment of Supreme Court in (2001) 7 SCC 1, the definition of 'establishment' in the CLRAA takes in its fold purely private undertakings...\".Concerns about privatization are, therefore, unfounded.

If AAI was admittedly obligated to follow the 26th July, 2004 notification and DIAL has assumed all of AAI's obligations, then DIAL must also be obligated to follow the notification. In other words, the notification issued by the Central Government is equally binding on DIAL.\n\nThe OMDA makes it clear that AAI maintains ultimate responsibility for the airports. The fact that DIAL was transferred only a portion of AAI's work which DIAL only has incomplete control over as well as the fact that DIAL meets the definition of a contractor under the CLRA Act further suggests that DIAL is nothing more than a contractor for AAI establishment. That being the case, notification dated 26th July, 2004 directed at AAI establishment must also apply to DIAL.\n\nHolding the 26th July, 2004 notification inapplicable to DIAL would mean that the Government would have to issue separate notification every time AAI contracts with a third party. This would clearly violate the basic objects and reasons of CLRAA.\n\nThe contention of DIAL that it would not be bound by the obligation of AAI establishment would lead to absurd consequences. The Division Bench in the impugned judgment has rightly pointed out that every time a fresh agreement is entered into, the entire process of getting a notification issued by the appropriate government in relation to the same work of trolley retrieval and with the same establishment via-a-vis such private player must be repeated. But this interpretation would defeat the rights of the workmen which are meant to be protected by the CLRAA.\t\t\t\t         \t\t [Para 58,81,83,85]"

The Court has to examine carefully the purpose of such provision and the consequences that may follow from non-observance thereof. If the context does not show nor demands otherwise, the text of a statutory provision couched in a negative form ordinarily has to be read in the form of command. When the word \"shall\" is followed by prohibitive or negative words, the legislative intention of making the provision absolute, peremptory and imperative becomes loud and clear and ordinarily has to be inferred as such. There being nothing in the context otherwise, there has to be clear ninety-six hours interval between the accused being charged for which he is to be tried and his arraignment and interval time in Rule 34 must be read absolute. A trial before General Court Martial entails grave consequences. The accused may be sentenced to suffer imprisonment. He may be dismissed from service. The consequences that may follow from non-observance of the time interval provided in Rule 34 being grave and severe, as it must be, that the said provision is absolute and mandatory. If the interval period provided in Rule 34 is held to be directory and its strict observance is not insisted upon, in a given case, an accused may be called upon for trial before General Court Martial no sooner charge/charges for which he is to be tried are served. Surely, that is not the intention; the timeframe provided in Rule 34 has definite purpose and object and must be strictly observed. Its non-observance vitiates the entire proceedings.   [Para 22]\n\nMerely because the respondent pleaded guilty is immaterial. The mandatory provision contained in Rule 34 having been breached, the Division Bench cannot be said to have erred in affirming the order of the Single Judge setting aside the proceedings of the General Court Martial.

                "description": "Army HQ letter (Circular) dated 28/12/1988, Para 5(f) - Discharge from service - On account of four red ink entries in service record - All such red ink entries recorded for overstaying leave ranging from 29 to 66 days - Only a show cause notice issued to appellant but no preliminary enquiry conducted before impugned order of discharge - Rule 13 of Army Rules contemplate only issuance of show cause notice - However, relevant circular additionally provides for holding a preliminary enquiry - Held, said circular providing for additional safeguards, cannot be said to be ultra vires Rule 13 - Circular has to be followed - Exercise of absolute and unregulated power of discharge would offend Art.14 of Constitution - Impugned order of discharge liable to be set aside.\n\n\tIt is true that Rule 13 does not in specific terms envisage an enquiry nor does it provide for consideration of factors to which we have referred above. But it is equally true that Rule 13 does not in terms make it mandatory for the competent authority to discharge an individual just because he has been awarded four red ink entries. The threshold of four red ink entries as a ground for discharge has no statutory sanction. Its genesis lies in administrative instructions issued on the subject. That being so, administrative instructions could, while prescribing any such threshold as well, regulate the exercise of the power by the competent authority qua an individual who qualifies for consideration on any such administratively prescribed norm. Inasmuch as the competent authority has insisted upon an enquiry to be conducted in which an opportunity is given to the individual concerned before he is discharged from service, the instructions cannot be faulted on the ground that the instructions concede to the individual more than what is provided for by the rule. The instructions are aimed at ensuring a non-discriminatory fair and non-arbitrary application of the statutory rule. It may have been possible to assail the circular instructions if the same had taken away something that was granted to the individual by the rule. That is because administrative instructions cannot make inroads into statutory rights of an individual. But if an administrative authority prescribes a certain procedural safeguard to those affected against arbitrary exercise of powers, such safeguards or procedural equity and fairness will not fall foul of the rule or be dubbed ultra vires of the statute. The procedure prescribed by circular dated 28th December, 1988 far from violating Rule 13 provides safeguards against an unfair and improper use of the power vested in the authority, especially when even independent of the procedure stipulated by the competent authority in the circular aforementioned, the authority exercising the power of discharge is expected to take into consideration all relevant factors. That an individual has put in long years of service giving more often than not the best part of his life to armed forces, that he has been exposed to hard stations and difficult living conditions during his tenure and that he may be completing pensionable service are factors which the authority competent to discharge would have even independent of the procedure been required to take into consideration while exercising the power of discharge. Inasmuch as the procedure stipulated specifically made them relevant for the exercise of the power by the competent authority there was neither any breach nor any encroachment by executive instructions into the territory covered by the statute. The procedure presented simply regulates the exercise of power which would, but for such regulation and safeguards against arbitrariness, be perilously close to being ultra vires in that the authority competent to discharge shall, but for the safeguards, be vested with uncanalised and absolute power of discharge without any guidelines as to the manner in which such power may be exercised. Any such unregulated and uncanalised power would in turn offend Article 14 of the Constitution.\n\n(1996) 3 SCC 65, (2008) 3 SCC 386, (2009) 7 SCC 370 Disting. \t   [Para 12,13,15]"

Constitution of India, Art.136.\n\nThe record reveals that GCM was held against appellant on different dates, appellant had made voluntary written confessional statement before GCM admitting allegations in charge-sheet.  Proceedings were recorded by GCM in the presence of appellant, his defending officer and witnesses.  Number of witnesses were examined by the prosecution in support of the charges in the presence of appellant who was afforded full opportunity of cross-examining them which he did not avail.  Despite giving warning that he was not obliged to make, appellant made written confessional statements and additional statement in summary evidence in presence of witnesses.  Findings of conviction and sentences imposed by GCM were confirmed by the competent authority in terms of S.154 of the Act.  Proceedings were quite immaculate where trial was fair and every possible opportunity afforded to appellant to defend his case.  Single Judge misdirected himself in concluding that proceedings held by GCM were inconsistent with the provisions of the Army Act and findings were not in accordance with the law.  Single Judge acted as if he is sitting in appeal.  There was no illegality or irregulatiry in the GCM which was fairly and properly conducted by most qualified members.  Appeal allowed.

Sub-Section (2) of Section 120 deals with some offences in respect of which certain restrictions are applicable. The offences so stipulated are those punishable under Sections 34, 37 and 69 of the Act or those against the Officer holding the Court. Apart from Sections 34, 37 and 69 of the Act, there are various other provisions where different kinds of offences are spelt out and dealt with. For example in Chapter VI of the Act, Section 38 deals with offence of desertion, Section 39 deals with offence of absence without leave, Section 40 deals with striking or threatening a Superior Officer, Section 41 deals with disobedience to the Superior Officer, Section 42 deals with insubordination and so on. Out of multitude of such offences, only Sections 34, 37 and 69 are mentioned in sub-Section (2) in respect of which restrictions stipulated in sub-Section (2) apply. Additionally, one more category, namely \"any offence against the officer holding a Court\" is also specified. Such of the offences as are directed against the officer holding the Court, may include those under Sections 40, 41, 42 and so on, depending upon facts of the case. Sub-Section (2) of Section 120 prescribes that in respect of such stipulated offences, in normal circumstances, an SCM shall not try the accused without making a reference to the officer who is otherwise empowered to convene a DCM in regular course or an SGCM while on active service. It further states that if there is no grave reason for immediate action, such reference to the concerned officer must be made and no person should be tried without such reference in respect of any offence so stipulated i.e. those under Sections 34, 37 and 69 of the Act or those against the officer holding the Court. However no such restriction applies in cases other than Sections 34, 37, and 69 of the Act or offences against the officer holding the Court. This provision thus categorizes the offences in two compartments i.e. those which require a reference and those which do not. This distinction is also noticeable from sub Rule 2 of the Rule 22 which mandates that CO shall not dismiss a charge in respect of offences which require a reference to superior authority in terms of Section 120 (2) of the Act. Therefore in the instant case submission that the sentence appearing in Paragraph No.20 of the judgment of the High Court to the effect that only offences under Sections 34, 37 and 69 of the Act could be tried by an SCM is not correct. \t [Para 21,22]"

Sub-Section (2) then prescribes that the proceedings shall, however, be attended through-out by two other persons specified therein. However, such persons are not to be sworn or affirmed. Unlike Sections 113, 115 and 114, where composition of the concerned Court-Martial is prescribed to consist of atleast three officers, it is the CO alone who constitutes the Court under Section 116 in respect of SCM. Further, under Rules 39 and 40 of the Rules, CO of the accused, or of the Corps to which the accused belongs is specifically disqualified for serving on a GCM or DCM and composition of a GCM ought to compose of officers of different corps or departments. However no such restriction applies to SCMs and in fact the CO himself must constitute the Court. The Act has thus given drastic power to one single individual, namely, the CO who alone is to constitute the Court. No doubt, this power comes with restrictions insofar as the power to award sentence is concerned in terms of sub-Sections (4) &(5) of Section 120. However even with such restrictions the power is quite drastic. The reason for conferment of such power is obvious that in order to maintain discipline among the soldiers and units, the CO must have certain special powers, for it is the discipline which to a great extent binds the unit and makes it a co-hesive force. The High Court of Delhi was therefore completely correct in observing that such power must be exercised rarely and when it is absolutely imperative that immediate action is called for. The satisfaction in that behalf must either be articulated in writing or be available on record, specially when the matter can be considered on merits by a tribunal, with the coming into force of the Armed Forces Tribunals Act, 2007. \t [Para 19,20]"

However, any such offence committed against a person not subject to military laws and otherwise than on active service then he would be subjected to the provisions of the said Code as regards the place and court of trial.  The said provisions clearly distinguishes 'active service' from merely being in service of Army.  When the person is either attached or engaged in military operations against an enemy or at a place wholly or partly occupied by enemy, or is attached to a force which is in occupation of the foreign country, only in those situations an army person could be said to be \"on active service\".  Merely because a person has joined the military service, he cannot be said to be \"on active service\" within the meaning of the said expression under the said Act.\n\nIn the case in hand, it is not in dispute that the petitioner was on leave when the offence was committed, for which the petitioner was tried and has been convicted by the Sessions Court.  The fact that the petitioner was on 20 days annual leave from 15.05.2002 and the incident had occurred on 06.06.20002 are not in dispute.  This apparently shows that on the relevant day the petitioner was not on active service within the meaning of the said expression under the said Act. Secondly undisputedly the person who is stated to have been murdered was not subject to the military law.  Being so, considering the provisions of Section 70 of the said Act, the petitioner could have been tried only by the Court to which the said Code applies.\t\t\t\t\t\t        [Para 12,13]"

Therefore, the date of commencement of the period of limitation for the purpose of GCM of the respondent, commenced on December 3, 1994 when directions was given by GOC-in-C Western Command to initiate disciplinary action against the delinquent.  Hence, the period of limitation for the purpose of trial of the delinquent commenced on December 3, 1994 when the GOC-in-C Western Command being the competent authority directed disciplinary action against the respondent in terms of Section 122(1)(b) of the Army Act.  The period of three years from the direction dated December 3, 1994 would expire on December 2, 1997, whereas the GCM commenced the trial against the respondent on December 17, 1996 which was well within the period of limitation of three years.

                "description": "Army HQ letter (Circular) dated 28/12/1988, Para 5(f) - Discharge from service - On account of four red ink entries in service record - All such red ink entries recorded for overstaying leave ranging from 29 to 66 days - Only a show cause notice issued to appellant but no preliminary enquiry conducted before impugned order of discharge - Rule 13 of Army Rules contemplate only issuance of show cause notice - However, relevant circular additionally provides for holding a preliminary enquiry - Held, said circular providing for additional safeguards, cannot be said to be ultra vires Rule 13 - Circular has to be followed - Exercise of absolute and unregulated power of discharge would offend Art.14 of Constitution - Impugned order of discharge liable to be set aside.\n\n\tIt is true that Rule 13 does not in specific terms envisage an enquiry nor does it provide for consideration of factors to which we have referred above. But it is equally true that Rule 13 does not in terms make it mandatory for the competent authority to discharge an individual just because he has been awarded four red ink entries. The threshold of four red ink entries as a ground for discharge has no statutory sanction. Its genesis lies in administrative instructions issued on the subject. That being so, administrative instructions could, while prescribing any such threshold as well, regulate the exercise of the power by the competent authority qua an individual who qualifies for consideration on any such administratively prescribed norm. Inasmuch as the competent authority has insisted upon an enquiry to be conducted in which an opportunity is given to the individual concerned before he is discharged from service, the instructions cannot be faulted on the ground that the instructions concede to the individual more than what is provided for by the rule. The instructions are aimed at ensuring a non-discriminatory fair and non-arbitrary application of the statutory rule. It may have been possible to assail the circular instructions if the same had taken away something that was granted to the individual by the rule. That is because administrative instructions cannot make inroads into statutory rights of an individual. But if an administrative authority prescribes a certain procedural safeguard to those affected against arbitrary exercise of powers, such safeguards or procedural equity and fairness will not fall foul of the rule or be dubbed ultra vires of the statute. The procedure prescribed by circular dated 28th December, 1988 far from violating Rule 13 provides safeguards against an unfair and improper use of the power vested in the authority, especially when even independent of the procedure stipulated by the competent authority in the circular aforementioned, the authority exercising the power of discharge is expected to take into consideration all relevant factors. That an individual has put in long years of service giving more often than not the best part of his life to armed forces, that he has been exposed to hard stations and difficult living conditions during his tenure and that he may be completing pensionable service are factors which the authority competent to discharge would have even independent of the procedure been required to take into consideration while exercising the power of discharge. Inasmuch as the procedure stipulated specifically made them relevant for the exercise of the power by the competent authority there was neither any breach nor any encroachment by executive instructions into the territory covered by the statute. The procedure presented simply regulates the exercise of power which would, but for such regulation and safeguards against arbitrariness, be perilously close to being ultra vires in that the authority competent to discharge shall, but for the safeguards, be vested with uncanalised and absolute power of discharge without any guidelines as to the manner in which such power may be exercised. Any such unregulated and uncanalised power would in turn offend Article 14 of the Constitution.\n\n(1996) 3 SCC 65, (2008) 3 SCC 386, (2009) 7 SCC 370 Disting. \t   [Para 12,13,15]"

He was allegedly making use of the mathematical formulae for solving the question paper. He was thereafter not allowed to continue with the paper. The question paper, answer book and the calculator were seized by the Invigilating authorities. In due course he was served with a charge-sheet. He was charged under Section 63 of the Army Act that he was in improper possession of a calculator containing written material pertaining to the said paper and thus committed an act prejudicial to good order and military discipline. The instructions pertaining to examination provided inter alia that a candidate is entitled to use pocket calculators and logarithm tables, etc.\n\nA person subject to the Army Act can be punished under S.63 of that Act, if he has done anything in violation of military discipline and his conduct is prejudicial to good order. The whole evidence adduced in the instant case revealed that:\n\n1) There was no legal identification of the calculator;\n\n2) There was no confirmation of any particular formulae of being any use to the examinee;\n\n3) The instructions leave no manner of doubt that calculators, log tables and Mathematical tables are permissible aids in the examination;\n\n4) There is no restriction as to which publication of tables one uses in the examination;\n\n5) These publications of Logarithm and Mathematical tables also contained Mathematical formulae;\n\n6) No effort was made to seal the incriminating material;\n\n7) Formulae on the back of the calculator were never reduced to writing.\n\n8) Not even a single formula has been pointed out as being relevant to the paper in question;\n\nThese are only some of our observations. Thus there was no legal evidence on the basis of which the charge could be said to be proved. The findings of the Court Martial that the examinee is guilty of the charges levelled against him are vitiated on account of the fact that it is a case of no evidence. Merely because the examinee had written the formulae on the back of the calculator, could not amount to use of unfair means. No evidence has been led by the prosecution to establish that mathematical formulae were not contained in any of the books in possession of the other candidates. Thus it could not be said that the examinee had committed an act prejudicial to military discipline.   [Para 7,8]"

Constitution of India, Art.136.\n\nThe record reveals that GCM was held against appellant on different dates, appellant had made voluntary written confessional statement before GCM admitting allegations in charge-sheet.  Proceedings were recorded by GCM in the presence of appellant, his defending officer and witnesses.  Number of witnesses were examined by the prosecution in support of the charges in the presence of appellant who was afforded full opportunity of cross-examining them which he did not avail.  Despite giving warning that he was not obliged to make, appellant made written confessional statements and additional statement in summary evidence in presence of witnesses.  Findings of conviction and sentences imposed by GCM were confirmed by the competent authority in terms of S.154 of the Act.  Proceedings were quite immaculate where trial was fair and every possible opportunity afforded to appellant to defend his case.

                ],
                "description": "Word \"enemy\" - Meaning of - Person carrying arms in a disturbed area - Does not ipso facto become an enemy - There has to be something much more to brand such a person as an enemy.\n\n\tIn any event, before a person can be branded as a militant or a terrorist or an insurgent, there must be the commission or some attempt or semblance of a violent overt act. A person carrying a weapon in a disturbed area in violation of a prohibition to that effect cannot be labeled a militant or terrorist or insurgent. Significantly, the word 'enemy' is used in conjunction with the word 'alien' in Article 22 of the Constitution. But the Army Act provides for a broader and more inclusive meaning. Nevertheless it inherently connotes an overt or covert act of violence or an imminent act of violence or such an attempt by any armed person. There can be little doubt that 'armed mutineers' and 'armed rebels' by definition deal in violence. Therefore merely because a person is carrying arms in a disturbed area, he does not ipso facto become an enemy. There has to be something much more to brand such a person as an enemy. That a person is not a mere law-breaker but an enemy can be determined only by a thorough enquiry. If members of our armed forces are deployed and employed to kill citizens of our country on the mere allegation or suspicion that they are 'enemy' not only the rule of law but our democracy would be in grave danger. In view of our discussion, it is not possible to accept the contention of the learned Attorney General that a person carrying weapons in violation of prohibitory orders in the disturbed area of Manipur is ipso facto an enemy or that the security forces in Manipur in such a case are dealing with an 'enemy' as defined in Section 3(x) of the Army Act. This is far too sweeping and general an allegation and cannot be accepted as it is or at its face value. Each instance of an alleged extra-judicial killing of even such a person would have to be examined or thoroughly enquired into to ascertain and determine the facts. In the enquiry, it might turn out that the victim was in fact an enemy and an unprovoked aggressor and was killed in an exchange of fire. But the question for enquiry would still remain whether excessive or retaliatory force was used to kill that enemy. Killing an 'enemy' is not the only available solution and that is what the Geneva Conventions and the principles of international humanitarian law tell us. Equally importantly, the instructions issued by the Army Headquarters under the caption: \"List of Do's and Don'ts while acting under the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958\" read with \"List of Do's and Don'ts while providing aid to civil authority\" restrain the Army from using excessive force. Therefore, even while dealing with the 'enemy' the rule of law would apply and if there have been excesses beyond the call of duty, those members of the Manipur Police or the armed forces who have committed the excesses which do not have a reasonable connection with the performance of their official duty would be liable to be proceeded against. The view expressed by the Constitution Bench of Supreme Court in Naga People's Movement of Human Rights that the use of excessive force or retaliatory force by the Manipur Police or the armed forces of the Union is not permissible. As is evident from the Dos and Don'ts and the Ten Commandments of the Chief of Army Staff, the Army believes in this ethos and accepts that this principle would apply even in an area declared as a disturbed area under AFSPA and against militants, insurgents and terrorists. There is no reason why this principle should not apply to the other armed forces of the Union and the Manipur Police. \t [Para 139,142,144,173]"

The result of the interplay between Section 4 and Section 5 of the Cr.P.C. and Sections 125 and 126 of the Army Act makes it quite clear that the decision to try a person who has committed an offence punishable under the Army Act and who is subject to the provisions of the Army Act does not always or necessarily lie only with the Army. Thus the criminal court under the Cr.P.C. could also try the alleged offender in certain circumstances in accordance with the procedure laid down by the Cr.P.C. \t\t\t\t [Para 163,164]"

There is no mention in Regulation 206 that the Officer-in-Charge reservists has the power to either remove or dismiss a reservist from service. A plain reading of sub-section (3) of Section 20 of the Army Act on the other hand, would show that an officer having power not less than a brigade or equivalent commander or any prescribed officer may dismiss or remove from the service any person serving under his command other than an officer or a junior commissioned officer. Regulation 206 cannot take away the power vested under the Army Act in the brigade commander to dismiss or remove any person working under him. The High Court rightly held in the impugned judgment that the brigade commander had the power to dismiss the appellant from service.  [Para 7]"

For example in Chapter VI of the Act, Section 38 deals with offence of desertion, Section 39 deals with offence of absence without leave, Section 40 deals with striking or threatening a Superior Officer, Section 41 deals with disobedience to the Superior Officer, Section 42 deals with insubordination and so on. Out of multitude of such offences, only Sections 34, 37 and 69 are mentioned in sub-Section (2) in respect of which restrictions stipulated in sub-Section (2) apply. Additionally, one more category, namely \"any offence against the officer holding a Court\" is also specified. Such of the offences as are directed against the officer holding the Court, may include those under Sections 40, 41, 42 and so on, depending upon facts of the case. Sub-Section (2) of Section 120 prescribes that in respect of such stipulated offences, in normal circumstances, an SCM shall not try the accused without making a reference to the officer who is otherwise empowered to convene a DCM in regular course or an SGCM while on active service. It further states that if there is no grave reason for immediate action, such reference to the concerned officer must be made and no person should be tried without such reference in respect of any offence so stipulated i.e. those under Sections 34, 37 and 69 of the Act or those against the officer holding the Court. However no such restriction applies in cases other than Sections 34, 37, and 69 of the Act or offences against the officer holding the Court. This provision thus categorizes the offences in two compartments i.e. those which require a reference and those which do not. This distinction is also noticeable from sub Rule 2 of the Rule 22 which mandates that CO shall not dismiss a charge in respect of offences which require a reference to superior authority in terms of Section 120 (2) of the Act. Therefore in the instant case submission that the sentence appearing in Paragraph No.20 of the judgment of the High Court to the effect that only offences under Sections 34, 37 and 69 of the Act could be tried by an SCM is not correct. \t [Para 21,22]"

                "description": "Summary Court Martial - Exercise of powers by Commanding Officer (CO) - Held, Act confers drastic power upon CO - However, such powers must be exercised rarely and when it is absolutely imperative that immediate action is called for - Satisfaction in that behalf must either be articulated in writing or be available on record - Specially when the matter can be considered on merits by a tribunal, with coming into force of Armed Force Tribunals Act, 2007.\n\n\tSection 116 of the Army Act empowers the CO of any Corps, Department and Detachment of the regular Army to hold an SCM and specifically states that he alone shall constitute the Court. Sub-Section (2) then prescribes that the proceedings shall, however, be attended through-out by two other persons specified therein. However, such persons are not to be sworn or affirmed. Unlike Sections 113, 115 and 114, where composition of the concerned Court-Martial is prescribed to consist of atleast three officers, it is the CO alone who constitutes the Court under Section 116 in respect of SCM. Further, under Rules 39 and 40 of the Rules, CO of the accused, or of the Corps to which the accused belongs is specifically disqualified for serving on a GCM or DCM and composition of a GCM ought to compose of officers of different corps or departments. However no such restriction applies to SCMs and in fact the CO himself must constitute the Court. The Act has thus given drastic power to one single individual, namely, the CO who alone is to constitute the Court. No doubt, this power comes with restrictions insofar as the power to award sentence is concerned in terms of sub-Sections (4) &(5) of Section 120. However even with such restrictions the power is quite drastic. The reason for conferment of such power is obvious that in order to maintain discipline among the soldiers and units, the CO must have certain special powers, for it is the discipline which to a great extent binds the unit and makes it a co-hesive force. The High Court of Delhi was therefore completely correct in observing that such power must be exercised rarely and when it is absolutely imperative that immediate action is called for. The satisfaction in that behalf must either be articulated in writing or be available on record, specially when the matter can be considered on merits by a tribunal, with the coming into force of the Armed Forces Tribunals Act, 2007. \t [Para 19,20]"

[Para 96]\n\nThe questions as to whether the vessel in question was found in Indian sea waters, or outside Indian territory, whether the vessel was in distress and if so, for what reasons, what steps were taken by the crew members on the vessel to come out of the distress call given by them to the Indian authorities at Indian port and whether steps allegedly taken in that behalf were in conformity with the relevant clauses of UNCLOS which govern the subject, whether the accused persons were having any valid licenses and certificates issued by statutory authorities under the applicable laws so as to enable them to possess and carry with them the arms/ammunition including prohibited categories of arms/ammunition on the vessel, what was the nature of business in which the vessel was engaged and whether owner of the vessel was having a license to do that business which enabled them to possess and carry such arms/ammunition in huge quantity, why amount of 40476 US dollars (Rs. 20 lakhs in Indian currency ) was credited by the owner of the vessel (A-1 & A-2) from US to the accounts of some accused persons in their accounts in India (HDFC Bank, Chennai), whether such amount was used for purchase of diesel which was recovered from the deck of the vessel or it was used for doing some other illegal activity etc. These were some of the material questions, which had a bearing over the issues involved in the case. Admittedly, these factual questions could be answered one way or other on the basis of evidence to be adduced by the parties in the trial but not otherwise. In other words, none of the aforementioned questions were capable of being answered without the aid of evidence to be adduced by the parties, by mere reading of FIR, Final report, charge sheet, for the first time by the High Court in exercise of its inherent jurisdiction. Similarly, the High Court had no jurisdiction to appreciate the materials produced like an appellate court while hearing the petition under Section 482 of the Code or/and Revision Petition under Section 397 abid. The High Court went into the questions of fact, appreciated the materials produced in support of charge sheet, drawn inference on reading the statements of the accused, and applied the law, which according to the High Court, had application to the facts of the case and then came to a conclusion that no prima facie case had been made out against any of the accused for their prosecution under the Arms Act. This approach of the High Court while deciding petition under Section 482 of the Code was wholly illegal and erroneous. The High Court also committed another error when it recorded the finding that provisions of Arms Act is not applicable to the case in hand and in any event are otherwise not applicable by virtue of Section 45(a) and hence no accused person can be prosecuted for any of the offences punishable under the Arms Act.

It would not be for the accused to appear before the Court and contend that the proceedings against him should not be initiated, when the Court is yet undecided, as to whether such proceedings should be initiated or not. The reason why the first informant needs to be heard when a 'B' summary report is filed, is obvious. It is because the the report of the investigating agency is adverse to the claims and contentions of the first informant. Fairness, therefore, requires that he should be given an opportunity of being heard and to point out how the conclusion arrived at by the investigating agency is wrong. The case of the accused at that stage, would be totally different. The investigating agency having already come to a conclusion, which is in his favour, the contest would be between the investigating agency and the first informant. It is the first informant who is aggrieved by the decision of the investigating agency and it is therefore that he is required to be heard before the conclusion arrived at by the investigating agency, is accepted. The accused is not at all aggrieved by the filing of a 'B' summary report. Therefore, there would be no parity between him and the first informant. Merely because the first informant is required to be heard, at that stage, the accused cannot claim that he also should be heard. The position of the accused in such a case would be totally different from that of the first informant and therefore, on the view that since the first informant is to be heard, principles of natural justice require that the accused should also be heard, cannot be accepted.\n\nAIR 1963 SC 1430 Rel. on. \t    [Para 9]"

However, the order must show the grounds and the facts and circumstances which are the basis for formation of opinion by the authority. In this case in the affidavit filed it was stated that the petitioner had participated in a morcha to the police station but it was nobody's case that at the time of morcha revolver was used by the petitioner. Further, appeal against the order was dismissed by the State Government on altogether different ground. The order was confirmed stating that the petitioner did not require a revolver for his self-protection without giving any reason for forming such an opinion.

Explosive Substances Act, S.5.\n\nThe two panch witnesses PWs.4 and 5 who are Village Administrative Officer and Sarpanch stated that the Police called them to the police station and asked them to put their signatures on blank papers and their signatures are marked as Exs:P-4 and P-5 respectively. They denied the suggestion that M.Os.l to 7 were recovered in their presence and that they signed on the panchanama after knowing the contents. PW-2- Head Constable and PW-3-Police Constable stated that on 30-1-1999 at 3.40 p.m., they arrested the accused and seized M.Os.l to 6 and scooter M.O.7. They did not state that any fire-arms or explosive substances were seized from the possession of the accused. M.Os.1 to 6 are neither fire-arms nor explosives. Therefore, there is absolutely no corroboration to the evidence of PW-1 to the effect that fire-arms and explosives were seized from the possession of the accused.  [Para 11]\n\nFurther the fire-arms alleged to have been seized from the possession of the accused were not produced before the Court though the fire-arms expert report is marked. Even the Court Clerk is not examined to connect the fire-arms examined by the expert as the fire-arms alleged to have been seized from the possession of the accused. Therefore, there is absolutely no link between the fire-arms expert report and the alleged fire-arms seized from the possession of the accused. Even in respect of the grenades also, no such grenades were produced in the Court. Of course, it is stated that the explosives expert defused the grenades in the police station but the expert who defused the grenades in the police station is not examined. No panchanama was prepared at the time of defusing the grenades. There is absolutely no material to show that the grenades alleged to have been seized from the possession of the accused were the same grenades that were defused by the expert. PWs.2 to 5 did not state that the grenades were found in possession of the accused. Therefore, it is not at all desirable to place reliance on the self serving testimony of PW-1.  [Para 11]\n\nThe learned Trial Judge without scrutinizing the evidence on record simply recorded conviction against the accused for the serious offences on the simple ground that PWs.1 to 3 are the police personnel and they have no reason to give false evidence against the accused. The learned Trial Judge failed to note that PWs.2 to 5 did not state anything incriminating against the accused in respect of the charges framed against the accused.\t\t\t [Para 11]\n\nHeld, therefore, that the conviction and sentence passed by trial Judge are not sustainable in law and are liable to be set aside."

Sub-section (5) merely requires that for passing an order suspending or revoking a licence, the licensing authority shall record in writing the reasons thereof and furnish the same to the holder of the licence on his demand. Even this requirement can be dispensed with in a case where the licensing authority is of the opinion that it will not be in public interest to furnish such reasons. Thus, the Act or the Rules made thereunder do not contemplate any express provision of notice or an opportunity of being heard to be given to the licence holder before cancelling the licence of a licence holder. So far as the present case is concerned, there is no dispute that the reasons are recorded in the impugned order which has been communicated to the petitioner and thus there is no violation of any part of Section 17 of the Arms Act.\n\nThe entire scheme of Sections 17 and 18 clearly reflects that if the possession of arms by the licensee is likely to pose danger to the public peace and safety, then it can straight way cancel without holding any enquiry, after recording its satisfaction in writing. In such a situation, the person aggrieved shall have a right to ventilate his grievance only before the appellate authority and not before the authority cancelling licence.

What is surprising is that under the proviso the court may for any adequate and special reasons to be recorded in the judgment impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than one year.  This provision under section 25 of the Arms Act clearly goes to show that so far as the punishment is concerned, the minimum punishment shall be of imprisonment for one year and the maximum punishment of imprisonment may extend to three years.  The proviso further makes it clear that even in respect of minimum sentence for adequate and special reasons to be recorded in the judgment the court may impose a sentence of imprisonment for a term of less than one year.  It seems that the trial court has been very callous in inflicting the punishment and sentence of five years in the sense the trial court has awarded sentence without going into the provisions made in the Arms Act and more particularly the provisions contained in section 25 which is a section making provisions for punishment.  Therefore, the trial court has no doubt committed an error in awarding sentence.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 4]"

In other words, in case if the accused seeks to place reliance on Section 45(a) to avoid his prosecution under the Arms Act then it is necessary for him to prove that arms/ammunition stored on the vessel were \"forming part of the ordinary armament or equipment\" of the vessel. The qualifying words to seek exemption are \"forming part of the ordinary armament or equipment of the vessel.\" The question as to whether arms/ammunition form part of the ordinary armament or equipment of any vessel is a question of fact. The accused has to, therefore, satisfy that the arms/ammunition seized from the vessel are, in fact, part of the ordinary armament or equipment of their vessel and hence were exempted from the operation of the Arms Act by virtue of Section 45 (a). Thus, the object of Section 45(a) is to give exemption from applicability of the Arms Act to those arms/ammunition, which form part of any ordinary armament or equipment of the vessel and not to all arms/ammunition on the vessel. It cannot, therefore, be construed to mean that Section 45(a) enable every vessel to carry any number of arms/ammunition regardless of its purpose, necessity and requirement to carry such arms/ammunition on the vessel.

                "description": "License for possessing arms - Principles of grant - What constitutes \"good reasons\" as stipulated u/S.13(3)(b) - Meaning to be derived from S.14 - Threat to life or property of applicant is not criterion - Relevant factor is genuineness of need - Regarding that need, applicant's own perception is to be respected and considered - Further, grant of license is connected with one's right to protect himself u/Art.21 - Hence, grant of license should be rule and refusal an exception.\n\nThe clause (b) of Section 13(3) of the Arms Act makes it mandatory for the licensing authority to grant licence if the licensing authority is satisfied that the person by whom the licence is required has a good reason for obtaining the same. It can be noticed that this section does not say that only when there is a favourable recommendation by the police authority that the licence be granted. This section on the other hand lays down that the licence can be issued for any good reason. Now, what can be the good reason has not been clarified anywhere in the Act. An insight into what constitutes the good reason for grant of licence could be had by considering the provisions of section 14 of the Arms Act. \t [Para 7]\n\nIt is also worthwhile to note that under section 14, there is no such ground as absence of any threat to life or property of person, to refuse the grant of licence. It would then mean that presence or absence of threat to life or property of a person from the perspective of police authority, cannot be a good ground for refusal within the meaning of section 14. It would then follow that a police report saying there is no threat to life or property of a person is not relevant for either refusing or even granting licence under section 14 and section 13 respectively. Relevant rather a criterion would be the genuineness of the need of the person, examined from the individuals own perception and his security wants in the light of his mental and physical make up and factors serving as express disqualifications for a person to hold the licence under section 14 of the Arms Act. This is what constitutes the \"good reason\" for grant of licence under section 13(3)(b), Arms Act. The authority, however, must be wary of those needs which are fanciful or simply pretentious or purely fired by a desire to flaunt or parade in public the firearm as a fashion trend. This is not to say that a need felt by a person to possess a firearm is false only because police do not think it to be real. As said earlier, an individual's own feeling of insecurity is an important factor. So, it needs to be respected and considered on the touchstone of his own psyche, physical and mental make-up and other factors contained in section 14 of the Arms Act. After all, it is now a settled law that as possession of a non-prohibited firearm helps effectuate a person's right to protect himself, the right is considered as a part of fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, subject of course to reasonable restrictions. Therefore, generally speaking, granting a licence should be the rule and refusal an exception, for reasons be recorded in writing. \t [Para 8]\n\nThis view is consistent with the legislative intent discernible from section 14(2) of the Act. This provision of law creates an embargo upon the power of the authority to refuse grant of licence by laying down that it shall not refuse licence merely on the ground that such person does not possess sufficient property. The Legislature intends that possession of property would have no bearing on exercise of the power to refuse grant of licence. It would also then mean that absence of threat to the property is no criteria for refusal of the licence. So, if absence of threat to the property is not a criteria for refusal of licence, it can also be found inferentially that absence of threat to the person of the applicant would be no criteria for refusal of the licence.

The provisions of Arms Act with regard to suspension or cancellation of Arms licence cannot be invoked lightly in an arbitrary manner.

Protection to life, property of citizen is responsibility of the State. It is only when person apprehends that machinery of State would not come to his help for protection, he/she applies for licence under the Act. The provisions of Section 17 A of the Arms Act indicate that arms licence can be cancelled or suspended if the licensing authority finds it necessary for the security of public peace or public safety. Merely because a criminal case is pending, the provisions of Section 17 of the Arms Act would not be attracted. Such provisions would be attracted in case the licensing authority finds that continuance of licence is detrimental to public peace or public security and safety. But the authority concerned will have to record a finding that how and under what circumstances and in what manner possession of arms licence could be contrary to the provisions of Section 17 B of the Arms Act.

                ],
                "description": "Penal Code (1860), Ss.141, 149 - Terrorist activities - Unlawful assembly - Police received information about assemblage of extremists in a village with arms and ammunition looted from police station - Their plan was to attack their rivals and kill them - On seeing police raiding party, the assembled extremists started firing - Police apprehended some accused - Arms, ammunition, incriminating letters, were seized in search of house where accused assembled - Police official and 3 accused were killed in incident - Plea of accused is that they were not terrorists - Facts and circumstances of case establish common object of unlawful assembly - Plea of accused that assembly was formed for protection from attack by upper caste people not credible - It is evident that accused persons were well prepared to indulge in violent acts - Conviction of accused by trial court proper.\n\nMajor plea which was emphasized related to the question whether Section 149, IPC has any application for fastening the constructive liability on the basis of unlawful acts committed pursuant to the common object by any member of the acts which the members of the unlawful assembly knew to be likely to be committed which is the sine qua non for its operation. The emphasis is on the common object and not on common intention. Mere presence in an unlawful assembly cannot render a person liable unless there was a common object and he shared the same or was actuated by that common object and that object is one of those set out in Section 141. Where common object of an unlawful assembly is not proved, the accused persons cannot be convicted with the help of Section 149. The crucial question to determine is whether the assembly consisted of five or more persons and whether the said persons entertained one or more of the common objects, as specified in Section 141. It cannot be laid down as a general proposition of law that unless the commission of an overt act is proved against a person, who is alleged to be a member of unlawful assembly, it cannot be said that he is a member of an assembly. The only thing required is that he should have understood that the assembly was unlawful and was likely to commit any of   the acts which fall within the purview of Section 141. The word 'object' means the purpose or design and, in order to make it 'common', it must be shared by all. In other words, the object should be common to the persons, who compose the assembly, that is to say, they should all be aware of it and concur in it. A common object may be formed by express agreement after mutual consultation, but that is by no means always necessary. It may be formed at any stage by all or a few members of the assembly and the other members may just join and adopt it. Once formed, it need not continue to be the same. It may be modified or altered or abandoned at any stage. The expression 'in prosecution of common object' as appearing in Section 149 have to be strictly construed as equivalent to 'in order to attain the common object'. It must be immediately connected with the common object by virtue of the nature of the object. There must be community of object and the object may exist only up to a particular stage, and not thereafter. Members of an unlawful assembly may have community of object up to certain point beyond which they may differ in their  objects and the knowledge, possessed by each member of what is likely to be committed in prosecution of their common object may vary not only according to the information at his command, but also according to the extent to which he shares the community of object, and as a consequence of this the effect of Section 149, IPC  may also vary on different members of the same assembly.  [Para 11]\n\nWhen the factual scenario is considered in the background of the legal position enumerated above, the inevitable conclusion is that Section 149 has been rightly applied. The fact that the unlawful assembly's common object was to resist the enforcement of law, and to commit criminal offences and to overawe the authorities/public servants by use and show of criminal force stood firmly established on the evidence on record. Consequently, the criminal acts committed in furtherance of the common object, which acts were not only part of the common object of the unlawful assembly but also such which the members of the assembly knew reasonably well are such as are likely to be committed squarely attract Section 149 I.P.C. Certain salient factual aspects clearly establish prosecution version. Firstly, defence plea regarding alleged apprehended attack by higher caste people has been found to be of no substance. If really the accused persons had gathered for reaping singada as claimed, there was no reason for the call to be given to start shooting at the police and then actual firing. A person who apprehends attack from some other person would rather welcome the arrival of the police and bring to notice of the officials about the apprehended danger and not to start firing at the police officials knowing them to be police, with defiance adopting a violent posture. This itself is sufficient to discard the defence version about nature and object of assembly. Further, the materials seized show that the object of the assembly was preparation for commission of crime. The presence of huge quantity of arms and that too sophisticated arms unerringly shows the nature of the assembly was unlawful. One of the printed materials i.e., literatures seized clearly indicates their involvement in nature and type of activities which were envisaged in and covered by Section 3(1) of the TADA Act. The plea that place of occurrence was different and was near pond where singadas were grown is also without substance. The dead bodies of the 3 persons who fired at the police officials were found in the house said to belong to the acquitted accused and the dead body of the deceased was also nearby. The evidence of the injured police officials is also relevant, and there is no reason as to why they would falsely implicate the accused persons. It is not correct as submitted by the learned Counsel for the appellants that none of the persons who were arrested were carrying arms. In fact, some of the prosecution witnesses have stated that they were also carrying arms, and this evidence has not been successfully rebutted. \t [Para 15]"

                "description": "Misconduct - Exhaustive enumeration of acts that constitute misconduct is impossible task - Compulsory retirement order as appellant filed property returns after six years when prescribed period for filing returns was only six months - Held, High Court was justified in accepting stand of the respondent that conduct of appellant was most unbecoming of an officer of the Air Force.\n\nThe range of activities which may amount to acts which are inconsistent with the interest of public service and not befitting the status, position and dignity of a public servant are so varied that it would be impossible for the employer to exhaustively enumerate such acts and treat the categories of misconduct as closed. It has, therefore, to be noted that the word \"misconduct\" is not capable of precise definition. But at the same time though incapable of precise definition, the word \"misconduct\" on reflection receives its connotation from the context, the delinquency in performance and its effect on the discipline and the nature of the duty. The act complained of must bear a forbidden quality or character and its ambit has to be construed with reference to the subject-matter and the context wherein the term occurs, having regard to the scope of the statute and the public purpose it seeks to serve. Held, it was evident from record that the prescribed period for filing property return was six months and though appellant was aware of the requirement he did not choose to file any return, even during the course of enquiry no return was filed and ultimately after show cause notice was issued it was filed. That being so there was no merit in this appeal which was accordingly dismissed.  [Para 8,16]"

In the instant case, the suit filed by the petitioner delinquent is for annulment of his first marriage with the complainant which does not fall within the ambit of sub-clause (g) of Regulation 578. On the other hand, on the date of initiation of Court of Enquiry against the petitioner, there was sufficient material before the Authorities to presume that the petitioner had contracted plural marriage which is prohibited by law, and, therefore, Authorities were completely justified in initiating departmental action against the petitioner in view of sub-clause (f) of Regulation 578. Considering the scheme of the Regulation, the contention raised by the petitioner in this regard is devoid of any merit and, therefore, same is rejected.

Similarly, sub-rule (4) of Rule 16 of Air Force Rules, 1969 contemplates that when the Chief of Air staff after considering the reports on an Officer's misconduct is of the opinion that the trial of the Officer by a Court-martial is inexpedient or impracticable, but further retention of such Officer in the service is undesirable, he shall, so inform the Officer and subject to the provisions of sub-rule (5) furnish to the officer all reports adverse to him calling upon him to submit in writing within a reasonable period, to be specified, his explanation in defence and any reasons which he may wish to put forward against his dismissal or removal. The Chief of Air Staff, therefore, in view of sub-rule (4) is competent to proceed against the petitioner administratively and recommend to the Central Government in view of sub-rule (8) of Rule 16 that the petitioner may be compulsorily retired from service. The only requirement of sub-rule (4) of Rule 16 in order to comply with the principles of natural justice is that the petitioner should be given opportunity by the Chief of Air Staff before recommending his removal from service to the Central Government. In the instant case, the show-cause notice was issued on the directions of the Chief of Air Staff whereby petitioner was called upon to show cause as to why he should not be dismissed/removed from service under section 19 of the Air Force Act, 1950 read with Rule 16 of the Air Force Rules, 1969. All the relevant grounds are also mentioned in the said show-cause notice and petitioner was called upon to give reply, if any, in his defence against the proposed action within twenty-one days. Therefore, petitioner was given sufficient opportunity contemplated under the rule, to defend his case before Chief of Air Staff in regard to his mis-conduct."

This is the only just and reasonable interpretation of the above certificate. Any other interpretation will be contrary to the clear terms of the certificate. In any event, the above No demand certificate cannot be construed to mean discharge of the contract by accord and satisfaction, because it is required to be furnished along with the claim and even before it is scrutinised by the respondent. The question of receipt in full and final settlement can arise only after an offer is made of a specified amount by the other side in full and final settlement of the claim. It is only at that stage that one can apply his mind and accept the payment in full and final settlement if he is satisfied with the same and only in such a case the acceptance can be termed as voluntary and unconditional. The No demand certificate issued in this case, in our view, can never be construed as accord and satisfaction and the same cannot constitute sufficient cause for refusing to refer a dispute to the arbitration.

It was the responsibility of the respondent to make all arrangements for transportation of the bales from Rajasthan to Bombay. All expenses necessary for that purpose were to be borne by the respondent. The Petitioner was to make payment only of the actual fright and Rs. 60/- per bale for covering other expenses. Therefore, loading charges which were required to be paid for loading the bales into transport from transporting them to Rajasthan to Bombay would be included in other expenses against which Rs. 60/- per bale was to be paid by the Petitioner to the Respondent. Similarly, insuring the goods during the transport was also part of the expenses required to be incurred in the course of transportation of the goods. Therefore, the charges payable for insuring the goods during their transport from Rajasthan to Bombay would also be included in Rs. 60/- per bale payable by the Petitioner to the Respondent. Reading of clauses 7 & 8 leaves one in no manner of doubt that making arrangement for transportation of the goods was entirely the responsibility of the Respondent and all that he was entitled to against the work of transportation was the actual freight that is paid by him and Rs. 60/- per bale for other expenses. Payment of insurance charges during the transportation would be included in the expenses necessary for transportation of the goods. In the circumstances arbitrators could not award amount towards these charges. Since the liability of the Petitioner to pay the loading charges and transit insurance charges does not flow from the agreement between the parties, the arbitrators could not get jurisdiction to make the award in that regard relying on any trade practice.

                "description": "Scope - Arbitration Clause empowering particular officer to appoint arbitrator - Inspite of notice that officer not appointing arbitrator - Application under S.20 - Court is competent to appoint arbitrator.\n\nFrom the plain language of Section 4, it does appear that once the agreement is filed, a choice lies in the party not to agree upon a particular arbitrator. The words \"arbitrator appointed by the parties\" may mean the arbitrator who is agreed to be appointed by any designated person in terms of Section 4. However, the further clause \"or where the parties cannot agree upon an arbitrator\" does provide discretion to the parties at that stage not to agree upon an arbitrator contemplated by the contract agreement and in the event of such disagreement, the Court would have all the discretion to appoint an arbitrator of its own. In short, the disagreement or a difference between the parties prior to approaching of the Court is the key-factor which would make available the two courses to the parties - the first via section 8 and the second via Section 20.  [Para 8]\n\nThe arbitration agreement in the instant case empowered the Engineer-in-Chief to appoint an arbitrator in case any dispute arose between the parties. A notice to appoint an arbitrator was given by contractor and nothing was done by the Engineer-in-Chief for about 1 year and a half who was empowered to appoint an arbitrator. It was because of this inaction on the part of the Engineer-in-Chief that the party proceeded to file an application under Section 20. It was only after the notice was given on this application that the Engineer-in-Chief proceeded to appoint an arbitrator of his choice. The appointment of arbitrator so made by the Engineer in-Chief could not be said to be a good appointment for then the words \"where the parties cannot agree upon an arbitrator\" would be rendered meaningless. Here the differences have arisen in respect of the matters to which the contract agreement applies. The party has not stopped there but has also given a 15 days' notice for the appointment of an arbitrator. However, even that notice has been ignored completely for a period of almost one year and 8 months and it is then that the party has approached the Court via application under Section 20. To say then that still the appointing authority would retain its power to appoint an arbitrator of its choice would be a sheer injustice. Further to say that the Court would have no choice but to simply appoint an arbitrator strictly in terms of the arbitration agreement would also render the further clause as a mere legislative surplusage. The correct interpretation, therefore, would be that under such circumstances where the party is required to proceed under section 20 and where the opposing party cannot give any sufficient cause for not filing the agreement in the Court, there lies a discretion in the party not to agree upon an arbitrator whether named in the agreement or otherwise. It does not mean that the party cannot agree on the named arbitrator in the agreement. It may in the given case still be prepared for an arbitrator named in the agreement or it may still be prepared to get an arbitrator appointed by the mode agreed to in the agreement, It would be certainly a matter of the choice of such party but where there is no agreement upon an arbitrator, the Court would have the power to appoint any arbitrator of its choice or at least it would not be bound to appoint an arbitrator named in the agreement.   [Para 8]\n\nIt has to be borne in mind that in the matters of arbitration, the agreement between the parties is of essence. In the absence of any agreement, the whole concept of arbitration suffers substantially. Therefore, where the differences arise and the parties to a contract ignore the agreement, the Court-intervention would be the only possible result.  [Para 9]"

He is a tribunal selected by the parties to decide their disputes according to law and so he is bound to follow and apply the law, and if he does not, he can be set right by Courts provided his error appears on the face of the award. It is equally well-settled that where it is apparent not by construction of the contract but by merely looking at the contract that the arbitrator travelled outside the permissible territory and thus exceeded his jurisdiction in making the award, it is an error going to the root of his jurisdiction.  [Para 6]\n\nIt is equally well-settled that if the arbitrator adjudicates a claim with reference to the clauses of the agreement itself, the agreement gets engrafted into the award and it is open to the Court to examine those clauses of the agreement and find out the correctness of the conclusion of the arbitrator with reference to those clauses. In the instant case, clause 75 is quite clear and unambiguous and not open to diverse meanings. There is no scope of interpreting the same.

The Award is a speaking Award. The reasonableness of the reasons given by the Arbitrator cannot be challenged and the appreciation of evidence by the Arbitrator is never a matter which the Court questions and considers. The Arbitrator was a sole judge of the quality as well as the quantity of evidence and it is not for the Court to take upon itself the task of being a judge on the evidence before the Arbitrator. Since there has been no dispute as to the contract between the parties, the interpretation of that contract was a matter for the Arbitrator on which this Court is not to substitute its own decision. On a view taken of the contract, the decision of the Arbitrator on the amount awarded is a possible view though perhaps not the only correct view, the said Award cannot be examined by this Court. The parties had led evidence before the Arbitrator which has been considered by the Arbitrator. Even though the claim made by the Petitioners against the Respondents in the Arbitration proceedings was for substantially large amount, merely because the Arbitrator has awarded only a sum of Rs.6 lakhs to the Petitioners, it cannot be said that the said Award made by the Arbitrator is scandalous. No case of the Arbitrator having bias against the Petitioners has been made out. No case of the approach of the Arbitrator in the matter being unfair or unjust has been made out by the petitioners. No case of predetermination of the Arbitrator in awarding the amount awarded to the Petitioners or of misconduct on the part of the Arbitrator or the proceedings before him has been made out by the Petitioners. The appointment of the Arbitrator was with the consent of the Petitioners and the reference to arbitration was also made with the consent of the Petitioners. There is no error of law apparent on the face of the said Award. The Arbitrator has followed the principles of natural justice while proceeding with the said reference and the said Award is not beyond the scope of the reference before the Arbitrator. The Allegation that the Arbitrator is guilty of non application of mind is devoid of any merit. In the facts of the case, the challenge to the said Award being not within the scope and ambit of S.30  the Petition fails. Hence, the Petition is dismissed.  [Para 6,7]"

The scope for interference by the Court with an award passed by the arbitrator is undoubtedly limited. [Para 7]\n\nThe decision of the arbitrator on a question of law specifically referred, right or wrong, is final and binding on the parties.  Such specific question of law referred must be either by agreement or by compulsion.  If, on the other hand, no specific question of law is referred, the decision of the arbitrator is not final, however much it may be within his jurisdiction, and indeed essential for him to decide the question incidentally.  By question of law specifically referred what is meant and understood is separate question expressly referred.  In the light of the facts of the present case, particularly with reference to the notice of intention and request for arbitration it can safely be held that no specific question of law was referred to the arbitrators or for that matter to the Umpire by the parties either under agreement or by compulsion nor did the parties desire a decision on a specific question of law.  Where no specific question of law is referred for adjudication by the arbitrator it cannot be said that specific question of law was referred. [Para 10,15,16]\n\nIt is well established that all clauses of the agreement must be read together and given due meaning to find out the intention of the parties.  One clause in a contract cannot and should not be read in isolation to other clauses of the contract.  The contract must be construed as a whole and effect must be given to all the terms and endeavour must be made to reconcile inconsistencies by the rules of construction.  In the instant case, the Umpire though noted various clauses of the contract yet refused to construe various clauses and give due consideration to them in the right perspective to find out whether it was the intention of the parties that ONGC would reimburse the tax liability which Sumitomo's sub contractor may have to incur.  On the face of the various clauses of the contract it is apparent and clear that ONGC could not have been made liable for reimbursement of the tax liability which Sumitomo's subcontractor had to incur and Sumitomo had to reimburse to their subcontractor.

The High Court also commented on the fact that summary proceedings were not envisaged under the Arbitration Act. The trial Court has, however, noted that both sides led evidence before the arbitrator and tendered documents which were considered by the arbitrator before giving his award. The trial Court has noted that on behalf of the respondents oral evidence of their architect Shri Bhagat and their Director Shri N. G. Bhave was adduced along with documentary evidence. On behalf of the appellants, no oral evidence was led but documentary evidence consisting of letters and other documents was produced. The respondents did not, at any time, protest before the arbitrator against the documents being taken on  record with a formal proof as envisaged under the Evidence Act. Documents on both sides have been taken on record by the arbitrator. The arbitrator had also before him joint measurements taken by the architect of the respondents in respect of the work done by the appellants. The arbitrator himself visited the site and inspected the construction of the building. On the basis of this evidence before him the arbitrator gave the award in question. This does not show any legal misconduct on the part of the arbitrator.\n\n The High Court could not have come to the conclusion that there is any legal misconduct on the part of the arbitrator in giving the award.

The question of inferring any consent from the conduct of the Respondents would arise only in case the notice which is initially issued is a proper and valid notice. In the present case, at no point of time the Respondents were called upon as required by provisions of section 8 to concur in the appointment of the sole arbitrator appointed by the claimant. In the absence of a proper notice being given to the Respondents, no inference can be drawn from their conduct. It is clear that if a valid notice under section 8 has been given then an inference can certainly be drawn from the conduct of the Respondents after receiving notice. In the present case, it is further to be seen here that despite the fact that no proper notice was ever given by the claimant, the Respondents have raised a specific objection to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator to conduct the arbitration proceedings. In the present case, it appears that both the parties to some extent were under misapprehension of law and therefore the conduct of the parties which is under misapprehension of law, cannot be deemed to constitute either waiver or estoppel.

The submission that the arbitrator cannot have jurisdiction to award interest for the period prior to the date of his appointment or entering into reference which alone confers him power is too stale and technical to be countenanced in our hands, for the simple reason that in every case the appointment of an arbitrator or even resort to Court to vindicate rights could be only after disputes have cropped up between the parties and continue to subsist unresolved and that if the arbitrator has the power to deal with and decide disputes which cropped up at a point of time and for the period prior to the appointment of an arbitrator, it is beyond comprehension as to why and for what reason and with what justification the arbitrator should be denied only the power to award interest for the pre-reference period when such interest becomes payable and has to be awarded as an accessory or incidental to the sum awarded as due and payable, taking into account the deprivation of the use of such sum to the person lawfully entitled to the same. [Para 47]\n\nFor all the reasons stated above, we answer the reference by holding that the arbitrator appointed with or without the intervention of the Court, has jurisdiction to award interest, on the sums found due and payable, for the pre-reference period, in the absence of any specific stipulation or prohibition in the contract to claim or grant any such interest.\t\t\t [Para 48]\n\nThe decision in Jena's case (1988) I SCC 418 : (AIR 1988 SC 1520) taking a contra view does not lay down the correct position and stands overruled, prospectively, which means that this decision shall not entitle any party nor shall it empower any Court to reopen proceedings which have already become final, and apply only to any pending proceedings.\n\n(1958) 1 SCC 418 overruled.\t [Para 48]\n\nPer Pattanaik, J. (Contra):- The fact that the arbitrator has the power to deal with and decide disputes which cropped up at a point of time, would certainly not clothe the arbitrator with any power, which neither any law confers upon him nor there is any usage of trade having the force of law nor is there any agreement between the parties conferring that power. It is difficult for me to conceive that such power could be conferred upon an arbitrator for the pre-reference period on the supposition that he must be presumed to have the power to grant interest as an accessory or incidental to the sum awarded as due and payable. It is not the question of absence of any specific stipulation in the contract but the correct criteria should be whether there is a positive provision in the contract, conferring the power to the arbitrator to award interest for pre-reference period. I need not discuss any further in view of my concurrence with Brother Mohapatra, J.\t\t\t [Para 2]\n\nPer Mohapatra, J. (Contra) :- In Abhaduta Jenab case this court has emphasised the position that the claim for interest for pre-reference period can be made only if there is a firm basis giving the claimants a cause of action for claim of such interest and in the absence of such basis for such claim an arbitrator is not competent to award interest. The position is well-settled that arbitrator is a creature of agreement, between the parties. He is vested with the power of adjudication of disputes in terms of such agreement. He has to act in accordance with law. Though he discharges the functions of a Court while adjudicating the dispute raised by the parties he cannot be said to be substitute for the Court in all respects. An arbitrator is not bound to follow the strict procedure applicable in a case before the Court. In many cases the arbitrator, though nominated as a Judge by the parties, may not have the requisite experience in the field of law which a presiding officer of a Court possesses. Therefore, it is necessary that in judging the claim of interest for pre-reference period he should ascertain whether such claim is permitted under the terms of the contract between the parties or there is a usage of trade having force of law in support of such claim or there is any other provision of the substantive law enabling the award of such interest\t\t\t\t [Para 20]"

One party cannot usurp the jurisdiction of the Court and proceed to act unilaterally. A unilateral appointment and a unilateral reference - both will be illegal. It may make a difference if in respect of a unilateral appointment and reference the other party submits to the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator and waives its rights which it has under the agreement, then the Arbitrator may proceed with the reference and the party submitting to his jurisdiction and participating in the proceedings before him may later on be precluded and estopped from raising any objection in that regard.  [Para 12]\n\nIn the event of the appointment of an Arbitrator and reference of dispute to him being void ab initio as totally incompetent or invalid the award shall be void and liable to be set aside dehors the provisions of Section 30 of the Act, in any appropriate proceedings when sought to be enforced or acted upon.

Perusal of Section 16 shows that conduct of the Petitioner of participating in the proceedings, depositing arbitration fees will also not amount to waiver, because sub-section 2 of Section 16 enables a party who himself has made appointment of the arbitrator to object to the appointment of the same person as an arbitrator, provided the objection to the jurisdiction is raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence.  In terms of the provisions of the Act, an appointment of the sole arbitrator can be made by an agreement of the parties by one party issuing notice to the other party suggesting the name of the person who it wants to be appointed as an arbitrator and giving other party 30 days time to consider the proposal.  In the present case there is no notice issued by either party which complies with the  requirement of Section 11(5) of the Act.  Issuance of a notice which complies with the requirements of Section 11(5) is a condition precedent for brining about a valid appointment of a sole arbitrator by agreement of the parties.  Therefore, as both notices issued by the Respondent do not comply with the provisions of Section 11(5) of the Act, the appointment of an arbitrator can not be said to be valid.\t [Para 7]\n\nSub-section 5 of Section 11 operates on two things; (i) absence of agreement on procedure for appointment of the arbitrator and (ii) failure of the parties to reach the agreement within 30 days of one party giving notice to the other party.  The scheme of Section 11(5) is that if there is no agreement between the parties in relation to the procedure that is to be followed in the matter of appointment of the arbitrator, then either parties make appointment within 30 days of one party issuing notice by agreement, otherwise the power to make the appointment passes on to the Chief Justice and once the power gets vested in the Chief Justice, parties by conduct or agreement cannot divest the Chief Justice of that power.  In the present case, admittedly, the appointment of the sole arbitrator is not made by the Chief Justice, therefore, the sole arbitrator who made the award had no jurisdiction to make the award.  The award of the learned arbitrator therefore, rejecting the objection to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, therefore, is liable to be set aside.\t [Para 8]"

                "description": "Arbitration clause - Word 'final claim' - Interpretation - Claim should not be in a fluid state.\n\nThe arbitration clause laid down that contractor, after presenting his final claim has to demand in writing that disputes relating to those matters indicated in the final claim should be referred to arbitration by the authorities. In short, the final claims must be definite, certain and crystallised under diverse heads either flowing from the final bill or even earlier arising out of the working of the contract even when the final bill is still not prepared by the authorities. Therefore, instead of reading down the term 'final claims' on disputed matters as found in clause 63.1.1. to mean only 'final claims' arising out of final bills, it must be held that the term 'final claims' on disputed matters as employed by clause 63.1.1 would cover final claims on disputed matters either lodged during the currency or even after its termination or even after preparation and submission of final bills by the authorities. In all these cases, the final claims on disputed matters contemplated by clause 63.1.1 must be crystallised and firm final claims which are required to be considered by the authorities for giving their response. In other words, the claims should not be in a fluid state and the appellant-contractor should not consider them to be not final but tentative to be revised or reconsidered at his end in future for raising ultimate claims on the relevant heads of dispute. If the appellant-contractor himself treats these claims at an earlier stage to be in a fluid state and not final, neither he can expect the authorities to respond thereto nor can he treat the authorities to have failed to respond thereto so as to lose the benefit of the procedure of arbitration binding between the parties as per the contractual terms. Word 'final' cannot be treated as a surplusage.\n\nOn the facts of these cases, the appellant's claim for appointment of independent arbitrators is rightly rejected by the High Court. The aforesaid conclusion, in the light of the documentary evidence on record as seen by us earlier, requires us to hold that the appellant-contractor had not complied with the procedure to be followed within the time schedule laid down by clause 63.1.1 for raising demand for reference to arbitrators by the authorities and had not demanded in writing that the disputes mentioned in the final claim dated 6-3-1995 should be referred to arbitration by the respondent-authorities. Hence, it could not be said that the respondent-authorities have failed to carry out their corresponding contractual obligation under the very same clause and, therefore, had forfeited their right to resort to the machinery of arbitration under the terms of the contract and, consequently, it was open to the Court to appoint independent arbitrators.

Such a plea, as has been urged in this Court, was not taken by the respondents before the arbitrator. Even in the objections filed  in the Court, the validity of the award has not been specifically questioned on the ground of its having been given in breach of any obligation of arbitrator to give reasons as spelt out by the arbitration clause. The judgment of the learned single Judge does not show such a plea having been urged before him. In the objection petition there is a vague and general plea raised that rejecting the claims forming subject-matter of cross-objection and allowing the claim of the appellant without assigning any reason was bad. Such an omnibus and general plea cannot be read as submitting that the amendment dated 4-9-1986 applied to the contract between the parties and that in view of the amended arbitration clause the unreasoned award was bad. It appears that the plea was for the first time raised at the appellate stage before the Division Bench of the High Court. Unwittingly the Division Bench fell into the error of entertaining such a plea and disposing of the appeal by upholding the same though the plea was not even available to the respondents to be raised at that stage.

[Para 21,21A,22]\n\nThe general rule of interpretation is that the retrospective operation is not taken to be intended unless that intention is manifested by express words or necessary implications. Section 85(1) of the new Act speaks about the repeal of the old Act. Section 85(2)(a) in clear words provides that notwithstanding the repeal of the old Act, all the provisions of the old Act shall apply in relation to the arbitral proceedings which had commenced before the new Act had come into force, of course, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. It also provides that all the proceedings commenced on or after 25-1-1996 shall be governed by the new Act. Besides, the provisions of law contained in the new Act disclose the intention of the Legislature against retrospective operation of the new Act. It abundantly makes it clear that the old Act would apply to the pending proceedings unless there is specific agreement to the contrary between the parties.  [Para 19,20]\n\nIn the instant case, the agreement spoken of is not one contrary to the provisions of law in force at the time of execution of the agreement but one in consonance with the provisions of the law in force. The option given to the parties to agree to contrary to the rule of applicability of the provisions of the old Act to the pending proceedings is in relation to the stage after coming into force of the new Act. There is nothing in the said provision to suggest even remotely any option to the parties to agree for anti-dating the enforcement of the new Act in relation to the pending proceedings. Besides, the saving clause specifically saves the repealed enactment for the purpose of its applicability to the pending proceedings. The provisions of law contained in the new Act materially differ from those in the old Act in relation to various procedural matters. It cannot be disputed that prior to 25th January, 1996 the parties were legally entitled to enforce the arbitration agreement in terms of provisions of the old Act. Therefore, any agreement to be governed by some other law contrary to the provisions of law in force at the relevant time would have been certainly a void agreement besides being hit by the provisions of Section 28 of the Contract Act.

His award need not be a reasoned one or a learned judgment but he must deliver his award as any reasonable man applying his natural, judicial mind would do and he shall not be careless and he shall not neglect any material before him. Total want or lack of evidence would be fatal to the award. Vice of perversity would put a death knell on an award of an arbitrator. Even as a layman he has to apply his mind acting as a reasonable man to the facts and figures and material before him to base his conclusion. No elaborate reasons or judgments are expected from an arbitrator. A bare minimum expectation under the law is that the award must have the foundation of some cogent material required of a reasonable man to resolve the dispute referred to him as an arbitrator. Every award must withstand the scrutiny as such an award gets an imprint or seal of a court of law and the award becomes an executable and enforceable decree of a court of law. All such tests which are applied to a decree will also have to be applied to an award. The award cannot escape the ordeal of these tests, merely because it is an award under the Arbitration Act. It is the duty of the executing court to X-ray the award and to lift the veil to find out what material was available before the arbitrator to have come to his conclusions. Certainly it is not the duty of the executing the court to decide whether the award was right or wrong but it can certainly decide whether it was baseless and/or perverse and based on any evidence or material at all.  [Para 11,16]\n\nA grant of decree does not debar or estop an executing court from testing the validity and legality of the award. Even a decree which is confirmed upto the Supreme Court can be questioned when it is to be in execution and the executing court can go into the contentions which are open to it under the law. An award has a far greater sanctity and far reaching consequences of determination of the rights of the parties as it threatens to be an enforceable and executable decree against the judgment debtor. The present arbitration proceedings through out suffer from a total absence of material on which the award is purportedly based. Nothing is visible to a naked eye. I have deliberately used the word material and not evidence. To begin with, there are no terms of reference formal or informal. The arbitration agreement is classically vague in every respect. The parties have not been specified and identified. Names of persons and individuals are not given. There is absolutely no whisper about the nature of the transaction between the parties, on the basis of which crores/lakhs of rupees are demanded. In the arbitration agreement itself, it was the duty of the parties to have named such persons who are claiming their dues from the judgment debtor. Consequently the execution petition is liable to be dismissed.  [Para 14]"

Civil P.C. (1908), S.10.\n\nNo court shall proceed with the trial of any suit in which the matter in issue is also directly or substantially in issue in a previously instituted suit between the same parties. In case of proceedings before two public forum like two courts, the rule is the forum wherein the proceedings were filed first would hear it to the exclusion of other. This principle of general application has not undergone any change under the Arbitration Act. Section 8 contemplates that a judicial authority before which an action is brought in a matter which is subject of an arbitration clause shall, if a party so applies not later than it submitted his first statement on the substance of the dispute, refer the parties to arbitration. The Civil Court therefore would be required to refer the parties to arbitration when there is an arbitration agreement and one of the parties applies for the court to do so. Though section 8 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 does not provide for a stay of a suit like 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1940, in effect the suit would stand stayed and/or the court would not exercise the jurisdiction to hear the suit by referring the parties to arbitration. This also contemplates that only one forum could decide the matter. But when no application under section 8 is filed, the public forum of Civil Court would hear the dispute to the exclusion of a private forum of an arbitral tribunal. In the present case, the plaintiffs after having filed two arbitration petitions has chosen to file the suit. The decision of the arbitration proceedings and the suit would depend upon the decision of the very same issue. In the circumstances, the plaintiffs themselves have chosen to waive the jurisdiction of arbitral tribunal by choosing the public forum. The plaintiffs are therefore not entitled to any relief in the arbitration petitions.  (1987)1 SCC 496 - Rel. on.\t [Para 23]"

Disputes about the existence of a contract and as to the existence of facts to so hold must be determined by the Court and not by the Arbitrators.  Arbitrators cannot by their finding, clothes themselves with jurisdiction as it is the court under Section 33 which has to decide the question.  An Arbitrator would be guilty of legal misconduct if he clothes himself with jurisdiction which is not there.  If the finding as to existence of the arbitral clause is based on nonconsideration of material documents the Arbitrators would be clearly guilty of legal misconduct within the meaning of Section 30(a) of the Act of 1940.  There was dispute as to the very existence of the written contract.  The arbitrators in not considering this material have misconducted themselves.  If this material had been considered it would be clear that there were disputes between the parties as to the existence of the contract. [Para 5,7]"

One clause made it clear that the unit rates shall include the cost of all services required to be rendered. The mere fact that instead of stacking them, they were helped to be loaded on to the barges would not mean that this was beyond the terms of the contract of the price stipulated as even otherwise they would have to stack the said pipes which would require hooking for the purpose of unloading.

No doubt payment of income-tax by the subcontractor was direct result of change in law. However, that liability was transferred from the subcontractor to the Respondent not because of the provisions of the Income-tax Act, which were introduced by amendment, but because of a contract entered into between the Respondent and the subcontractor. There is nothing in the agreement between the parties, which made it obligatory on the part of the Respondent to take on liability of the subcontractor in this regard. Therefore, it is obvious that the Respondent was free not to take on this liability of the subcontractor while entering into the contract with the subcontractor. The liability of payment of income-tax. Which is required to be paid as a result of change in law by the subcontractor was a voluntary act on the part of the Respondent. Thus, the Respondent was required to incur extra costs of payment of income-tax, which the subcontractor was required to pay, because of the term of the agreement between the respondent and its subcontractor and therefore, in my opinion, the petitioner is liable for reimbursement of the amount paid by the Respondent to its subcontractor, as income-tax.

The learned Arbitrator found that the petitioner No. 1 continues to be the partner of the firm and as a partner of the firm, it was his right to claim dissolution of the firm and therefore, in my opinion, the question of dissolution of the firm was very much part of reference that was made to the learned Arbitrator.\n\n The petitioner No. 1 had filed the suit as a partner of the firm M/s V. H. Patel and Co. for enforcing some of his rights as a partner, Seeking dissolution of the firm is a right of a partner. Had the suit remained pending, it was possible for him to amend his plaint seeking an order for dissolution of the firm, the cause of action for seeking such relief would be the same on which his claim in the suit was based. Cause of action for a counter claim can be different than the cause of action for the suit. Therefore, if a counter claim which may be based on a different cause of action can be considered by the Arbitrator, it would not be possible to hold that a claim which is based on the same cause of action on which the claim in the suit is based, cannot be considered.\n\n An Arbitrator has jurisdiction to consider all questions raised before him by the parties which relate to the dispute referred to the Arbitrator, driving a party to a separate litigation for the relief which relates to the dispute referred to the Arbitrator would not be proper and valid. In my opinion therefore, in the present case also, it was open to the petitioner No. 1 to claim a decree for dissolution of the firm in exercise of his rights as a partner of the firm which he could have made by amending his pleadings in the civil suit which was capable of being made and therefore, it was within the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator to consider that question.

(1908), S.34.\n\nAn arbitrator has power to award interest pendente lite and, where the contract is silent as to the awarding of interest, the arbitrator has power to award interest for the pre-reference period if there is a substantive law which empowers him to do so, or if there is a usage of trade for payment which has the force of law. In the instant case, there is no usage of trade. The only substantive law which empowers the arbitrator to award interest is the Interest Act, 1978. It is not in dispute that the arbitration was after coming into force of the 1978 Act i.e. from the year 1981. Thus, the arbitrator had power to award interest in view of Section 3 of the Interest Act, 1978.  [Para 24,25]\n\nA person deprived of the use of money to which he is legitimately entitled has a right to be compensated for the deprivation, call it by any name. It may be called interest, compensation or damages. This basic consideration is as valid for the period the dispute is pending before the arbitrator as it is for the period prior to the arbitrator entering upon the reference. This is the principle of Section 34, Civil Procedure Code and there is no reason or principle to hold otherwise in the case of arbitrator.  [Para 22]\n\nHowever, S.3 of the Interest Act places an embargo upon the power of arbitrator by words \" not exceeding current rate of interest.\"  The maximum rate permitted by R.31 on public deposits during the relevant period was Rs.10%. Therefore, the award of interest in excess of 10% was beyond the power of the arbitrator and could not be sustained.  [Para 26,31]\n\nThus the direction in the award for payment of interest on the entire amount inclusive of interest as made in the award, is perfectly justified both in principle and on precedent.

(1999)4 SCC 423 Overruled.\n\nRight to prefer cross-objection partakes of the right to prefer an appeal. When the impugned decree or order is partly in favour of one party and partly in favour of the other, one party may rest contended by his partial success with a view to giving a quietus to the litigation. However, he may like to exercise his right of appeal if he finds that the other party was not interested in burying the hatchet and proposed to keep the lis alive by pursuing the same before the appellate forum. He too may in such circumstances exercise his right to file appeal by taking cross-objection. Thus taking any cross-objection to the decree or order impugned is the exercise of right of appeal though such right is exercised in the form of taking cross-objection. The substantive right is the right of appeal; the form of cross-objection is a matter of procedure.  [Para 15]\n\nRight to take a cross-objection is the exercise of substantive right of appeal conferred by a statute. Available grounds of challenge against the judgment, decree or order impugned remain the same whether it is an appeal or a cross-objection. The difference lies in the form and manner of exercising the right; the terminus a quo (the starting point) of limitation also differs.\t [Para 18]\n\nForm of cross-objection is procedural and is only a manner of exercising right of appeal which is substantive, as we have already stated. Secondly, it is not merely the procedure prescribed by the Code of Civil Procedure which has been made applicable to proceedings under the Arbitration Act by Section 41 (a) of the Act: the entire body of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 has been made applicable to all proceedings before the Court and to all appeals under the Arbitration Act, 1940. The provision is general and wide in its applicability which cannot be curtailed; the only exception being where the provisions of the Arbitration Act and/or of rules made thereunder may be inconsistent, with the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 in which case the applicability of the latter shall stand excluded but only to the extent of inconsistency. We may hasten to add that to the extent of our disagreement with the law laid down in B. Subba Reddy's case, the proposition appears to have been rather widely stated in that case. In fact the question before the Court in .B. Subba Reddy's case was Whether cross-objection seeking the relief of award of interest at a higher rate was maintainable though such an order did not fall within the purview of Section 39 (1) of the Act.\t [Para 19]\n\nThe subject-matter of cross-objection and the relief sought therein must conform to the requirement of Section 39(1). In other words, a cross-objection can be preferred if the applicant could have sought for the same relief by filing an appeal in conformity with the provisions of Section 39(1) of the Act. If the subject-matter of the cross-objection is to impugn such an order which does not fall within the purview of any of the categories contemplated by clauses (i) to (vi) of subsection (1) of Section 39 of the Act, the cross-objection shall not be maintainable.

(1912) ILR 34 ALL 140 and (1909) 4 IC 625 held not good law.\n\nWhat happens to cross-objections if the appeal itself is found to be incompetent or not maintainable? Sub-rule (4) of Order 22 of the CPC provides for only two situations in which the cross-objection may be heard in spite of the original appeal having not been heard on merits. These situations are two: (i) the original appeal being dismissed as withdrawn, (ii) the original appeal being dismissed for default (default in appearance or any other default). Just as the enabling provisions of cross-objection contained in sub-rule (1) of Order 22 of the CPC are applicable to appeals under Section 39 of the Act the disabling provision contained in sub-rule (4) too would apply to appeals under Section 39 of the Act in view of the generality of the provisions contained in Section 41 of the Act. To put it briefly, if the Appellate Court forms an opinion that the original appeal itself was incompetent or not maintainable as it was filed against an order not falling within one of the clauses (i) to (vi) of sub-section (1) of Section 39 then the cross-objection shall also fall to the ground and cannot be adjudicated upon on merits. It has to be remembered that law of limitation operates with all its rigour and equitable considerations are out of place in applying the law of limitation. The cross-objector ought to have filed appeal within the prescribed period of limitation calculated from the date of the order if he wished to do so. Having allowed that opportunity to lapse he gets another extended period of limitation commencing from the date of service of the notice of the appeal enabling him putting in issue for consideration of the Appellate Court the same grounds which he could have otherwise done by way of filing an appeal. This extended period of limitation commences from the date of service of the notice of appeal and such notice ought to be in a valid or competent appeal.\t [Para 21]\n\nIf the appeal cannot be heard on merits for the reason that it was no appeal in the eye of law, service of notice in such appeal would not furnish cause for commencement of a new period of limitation for filing appeal in the form of cross-objection. The only exception in which the cross-objection can still be heard is one where the memo of cross-objection can be said to have been filed within the period prescribed for filing an original appeal against the impugned order and the memo also independently satisfies all the requirements of a memo of appeal.\t [Para 22]\n\nThe original appeal filed by the respondents herein was found to be not maintainable as not covered by any of the clauses (i) to (vi) of sub-section (1) of Section 39 of the Act. It was dismissed as incompetent. The question of the memo of appeal filed in the High Court by the appellants herein being treated as cross-objection and being taken up for hearing on merits does not arise. Independently treated as an original appeal the same was held to be hopelessly barred by time as the delay was not explained satisfactorily. The appeal filed in the High Court by the appellants herein has been rightly held liable to be dismissed as time-barred and is not available to be heard and decided as cross-objection in view of the original appeal filed in the High Court by the respondents herein having failed as incompetent.\t [Para 24]"

It is further well-settled that justice should not only be done but manifestly seen to be done.\n\nActual bias would lead to an automatic disqualification where the decision-maker is shown to have an interest in the outcome of the case. Actual bias denotes an arbitrator who allows a decision to be influenced by partiality or prejudice and thereby deprives the litigant of the fundamental right to a fair trial by an impartial Tribunal.

The expression \"all the parties interested\" occurring in Section 21, does not mean necessarily all the parties to the suit but all the parties interested in any matter in difference between them which they intend to refer.  What is required under Section 21 is that all the parties interested in the subject matter of reference should have joined. This does not mean that there must be an agreement amongst all the parties in the suit for reference to arbitration.  The subject matter of reference in the present case pertains to cancellation of writing dated 01-02-1976 and division of the property left by late Vinayakrao.  The plaintiffs and defendants 1 to 6 were parties to the writing dated 01-02-1976 and are the legal heirs of deceased Vinayakrao.  Thus, they are the only parties interested in the subject matter of reference. The defendants 9 to 14, are purchasers of some of the flats from one of the legal heirs of Vinayakrao and they cannot be said to be parties interested in the subject matter of reference i.e. to the writing dated 01-02-1976 and declaration of respective shares in the plot of land left by late Vinayakrao.  If the argument of the counsel for appellants is accepted, that would effectively mean that under Section 21 the parties in the subject matter of the suit, shall be the parties interested which is not the correct legal position.  What Section 21 of Arbitration Act, 1940 requires is that all parties who are interested in the subject matter of reference must agree that matter in difference between them shall be referred to arbitration and not parties interested in the subject matter of the suit.  A party may be a necessary party to a suit without being interested party with regard to dispute between the parties to the reference.  Is in the nature of dispute between the parties to the reference, the flat purchasers are the parties interested in such dispute. The answer is, no.  The flat purchasers have no interest in the plot of land. (1999)1 SCC 533, (1994)4 SCC 665 and (1990)1 SCC 214 - Referred to.   [Para 7]"

The words \"application in a reference\" used in sub-section (4) should therefore, be related back to sub-sections (2) and (3) and all applications regarding the conduct of arbitration proceedings or arising out of such proceedings or in which the court has to decide questions regarding the validity, effect, or existence of an award or an arbitration agreement between the parties to the agreement, should be treated as \"application in a reference\". The very foundation for the jurisdiction of the court under Section 34 is the existence of an arbitration agreement. The applicant asserts that there is such an agreement, while the plaintiff either disputes the existence of such an agreement or pleads that it is invalid. Section 33 gives an independent right to a person who wishes to challenge the existence or validity of an arbitration agreement to anticipate the other side and to initiate proceedings to have these questions determined beforehand. Thus applications under Sections 33 and 34 both are fundamentally in the matter of arbitration proceedings and fall within the purview of Section 31(4) of the Arbitration Act, though the former is intended to make an arbitration agreement ineffective and the latter effective and neither leads to a reference.

An arbitrator was appointed by the Supreme Court while setting aside the said award particularly in view of the fact that construction of the contract was in question. Supreme Court did not and could not retain any control over the proceedings of the arbitrator. A distinction must be borne in mind in a case where Supreme Court had no control over the proceedings and the case in which control of proceedings of the arbitrator had been retained. In the former case, having regard to the definition of the term 'court' as contained in S.2(c) of the 1940 Act, award must be filed before a court which has the requisite jurisdiction thereover. Whenever a term has been defined under a statute, the same should ordinarily be given effect to. The interpretation clause being prefaced by words 'unless there is anything repugnant in the subject and context' may in given situations lead to opine that the legislature intended a different meaning. While determining such a question, the court ordinarily again must preserve the right of a party to prefer an appeal. A right of appeal is a valuable right and unless there exist cogent reasons, a litigant should not be deprived of the same. It is a statutory right. As question of jurisdiction of a Court is involved herein, by consent of the parties also, jurisdiction cannot be assumed by Supreme Court. Supreme Court has no jurisdiction to entertain these applications. Direction given to transfer the case to a court having appropriate jurisdiction.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 13,21,22]"

The Arbitrator awarded esclanation in price. Challenge to the award in High Court was dismissed. However, intra court appeal allowed. In further appeal, Supreme Court held, it must also be borne in mind that a court does not sit as one in appeal over the award of the arbitrator and if the view taken by the arbitrator is permissible, no interference is called for on the premise that a different view was also possible. It was open to the contractor to contend that it was liable to be compensated on account of the fact that delay had been occasioned on account of reasons attributable to Pawanhans. The clause 43(1) and (2) of the contract when read together clearly visualize escalation of price on account of reasons beyond the control of the contractor and attributable to the other side. It clearly provided that remedy under clause 43(1) would be in addition to such other remedy that may be open to the contractor under other provisions. It cannot, therefore, be said that the award of arbitrator was so unconscionable that it required interference.   [Para 3,8,11,12]"

The Arbitration award was in favour of contractor. Challenge to the award in High Court was dismissed. Intra court appeal allowed. In further appeal, Supreme Court referred extensively to correspondence from the contractor vide letters 11/07/1990 requesting Pawanhans to ensure a regular power supply, 27/07/1990 regarding statement of accounts submitted by it and request for payment as per the accounts which had been cleared by the Architect. These letters were written by contractor when work was in the process of completion. The contractor desperately wrote leter on 10/01/1991 recoding that repeated requests were made for payment of certified bills, a huge amount being blocked arbitrarily over a long period of time. The letter on 21/11/1991 was a reminder and that in case there was a dispute, the matter be referred to the arbitrator. The letter dated 09/12/1991 from Pawanhans to the contractor shows that payment could be considered provided the contractor submitted a \"No Claim Certificate\". It appears that such certificate was indeed issued but with no result on which the contractor in his letter dated 26/12/1991 in reply to the letter dated 09/12/1991, again submitted that payments of certified bills be released, in case of a dispute regarding other payments, they should be referred to arbitrator. Contractor wrote letters on 17/02/1992, 05/05/1992 and 08/06/1992. No steps taken, contractor issued a letter 02/02/1993 for payment of dues and if payment not made, dispute be referred to arbitrator. In response to this, Pawanhans in its letter dated 09/02/1993 replied that matter was under scrutiny, it would take about 2 months and contractor would be informed in due course. As no reply was received, a letter dated 21/05/1993 was addressed by contractor complaining that nothing had been done and on contrary on 08/06/1993 the claim for any payment was rejected by Pawanhans observing that as a 'No Dues Certificate' had been submitted by the contractor, the question of any balance payment being due did not arise. It is at this stage that the contractor had invoked the clause for arbitration. The correspondence show that contractor was compelled to issue a 'No Dues Certificate' and in this view of the matter, it could not be said that contractor was bound by what he had written. It is also clear that there is voluminous correspondence over a span of almost 2 years between the submission of the first final bill on 03/06/1991 and the second final bill dated 02/02/1993 and as such the claim towards escalation or the plea of the submission of a 'No Dues Certificate' under duress being an after thought is not acceptable. Appeal allowed with costs.   [Para 13,16]"

Where the Court grants such authority consequentially arbitration agreement shall cease to have effect with respect to the difference or dispute. It flows therefrom that there exists implied power vested in the court permitting a party to avail the remedy under Ss.5 and 12 to rescind the arbitration agreement. In all cases it is not a condition precedent that there should in the first instance be an order appointing an arbitrator or he should enter upon reference for adjudication. In given circumstances and the factual background the court may be justified to exercise the power under Ss. 5 and 12. The question then is under what circumstances such power would be exercised. It could be seen that the court has the power and jurisdiction under Ss. 5 and 12 to grant leave to the applicant in exceptional circumstances to revoke the contract of arbitration. The court should exercise the power sparingly, cautiously and with circumspection to permit a party to the contract of a arbitration voluntarily entered into to relieve the party from dispute or difference and to order that the arbitration agreement shall cease to have effect in respect of the dispute or difference. The instant case is clearly, and undoubtedly hopelessly barred claim as the petitioner by his conduct slept over his right for more than 10 years. Statutory arbitrations stand apart. In these circumstances it is an exceptional case and the courts below have-justifiably exercised their discretionary power and jurisdiction under Sections 5 and 12 (2)(b) to permit the respondent to rescind the arbitration agreement and declared that the arbitration agreement shall cease to have effect with respect to the difference or dispute referred to in the notice of the petitioner and relieved the parties from the arbitration agreement. The Special Leave Petitions are accordingly dismissed without costs.   [Para 5,6,17]"

Sub-section (2), employing non-obstante clause, says that notwithstanding any term in an arbitration agreement to the effect that no cause of action shall accrue in respect of any matter required by the agreement to be referred until an award is made under the agreement, a cause of action shall, for the purpose of limitation, be deemed to have accrued in respect of any such matter at the time when it would have accrued but for that term in the agreement. Sub-section (3) thereof states that for the purposes of this section and of the Indian Limitation Act, 1908 an arbitration shall be deemed to be commenced when one party to the arbitration agreement serves on the other party thereto a notice requiring the appointment of an arbitrator, or where the arbitration agreement provides that the reference shall be to a person named or designated in the agreement, requiring that the difference be submitted to the person so named or designated. Sub-sections (4) and (5) are omitted as being not material. It would, therefore, be clear that the provisions of the Limitation Act would apply to arbitrations and notwithstanding any term in the contract to the contrary, cause of arbitration for the purpose of limitation shall be deemed to have accrued to the party in respect of any such matter at the time when it should have accrued but for the contract. Cause of arbitration shall be deemed to have commenced when one party serves the notice on the other party requiring the appointment of an arbitrator. The question is when the cause of arbitration arises in the absence of issuance of a notice or omits to issue for long time or contract to the contrary? The period of limitation for the commencement of an arbitration runs from the date on which, had there been no arbitration clause, the cause of action would have accrued. Just as in the case of civil actions the claim is not to be brought after the expiration of a specified number of years from the date on which the cause of action accrued, so in the case of arbitrations, the claim is not to be put forward after the expiration of the specified number of years from the date when the claim accrued.

                "description": "Arbitration and Conciliation Act (1996) Ss.34, 37 - Bombay Court Fees Act (1959), Sch.I, Art.3, Sch.II, Art.13 - Payment of court fees - Arbitral award - Setting aside of - Held, so far as the provisions of Art.3 of Sch.I of the Bombay Court Fees Act is concerned, the grounds on which the court can set aside an Award is not relevant, because the subject matter of the provisions of Bombay Court Fees Act is payment of court fees on plaint, application, petition or memorandum of appeal and not the grounds on which the court can grant reliefs to the applicant, plaintiff, petitioner or appellant.\n\nA comparison of the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 34 of the 1996 Act with the provisions of section 30 of the 1940 Act shows that the grounds on which an award could be set aside by the Court under the 1940 Act are different than the ones on which an award can be set aside under sub-section (2) of section 34 of the 1996 Act. But, so far as the provisions of Article 3 of Schedule I of the Bombay Court Fees Act is concerned, the grounds on which the Court can set aside an Award is not relevant, because the subject matter of the provisions of Bombay Court Fees Act is payment of Court fees on plaint, application, petition or memorandum of appeal and not the grounds on which the Court can grant reliefs to the applicant, plaintiff, petitioner or appellant. Therefore, the only provision of the 1940 Act referred to in Article 3 of Schedule I of the Bombay Court Fees Act is the provisions of Section 33 of the 1940 Act and bare comparison of that provision with the provisions of sub-section (1) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act shows that the provision of section 33 of the 1940 Act is repealed and re-enacted in sub-section (1) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act with slight modification. Therefore, reference to the provisions of section 33 of the 1940 Act in Article 3 of Schedule-I of the Bombay Court fees Act has to be construed, in view of the provisions of Section 8 of the General Clauses Act, as reference to the provisions of Section 34 of the 1996 Act. So far as an appeal filed under Section 37 of the 1996 Act is concerned, perusal of section 37 shows that an appeal is provided to the appellate Court against an order setting aside the arbitral award or refusing to set aside an arbitral award under Section 34. Thus, the provisions of \"Article 3 of Schedule-I\" do not apply to an application or petition filed under section 34 of the 1996 Act, they will also not apply to the memorandum of appeal filed to set aside or modify an award made by the Arbitrator under the 1996 Act. In other words nothing contained in Article 3 of Schedule-I of the Bombay Court fees Act applies to an application, petition or memorandum of appeal to set aside or modify any Award made under the 1996 Act as it does not apply to an application or petition or memorandum of appeal to set aside or modify an Award made under the Arbitration Act, 1940. Perusal of the provisions of Section 8 of the General Clauses Act shows that \"references in any other enactment to a provision in a former enactment\" is to be construed as 'reference to re-enacted provision in the new enactment\" unless a different intention appears. The different intention may appear either in the new enactment or in the other enactment. [Para 11]"

Under Section 8(1)(b) read with Section 8(2) if a situation arises in which an arbitrator refuses to act, any party may serve the other parties or the arbitrators, as the case may be, with a written notice to concur in a fresh appointment, and if such appointment is not made within 15 clear days after service of notice, the Court steps in to appoint such fresh arbitrator who, by a deeming fiction, is to act as if he has been appointed by the consent of all parties. This can only be done where the arbitration agreement does not show that it was intended that the vacancy caused be not supplied. However, under Section 15(2) of 1996 Act, where the mandate of an arbitrator terminates, a substitute arbitrator \"shall\" be appointed. Had Section 15(2) ended there, it would be clear that in accordance with the object sought to be achieved by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 in all cases and for whatever reason the mandate of an arbitrator terminates, a substitute arbitrator is mandatorily to be appointed. Supreme Court, however, in its landmark judgments, has interpreted the latter part of the Section 15(2) as including a reference to the arbitration agreement or arbitration clause which would then be \"the rules\" applicable to the appointment of the arbitrator being replaced. It is in this manner that the scheme of the repealed Section 8 is resurrected while construing Section 15(2). The arbitration agreement between the parties has now to be seen, and it is for this reason that unless it is clear that an arbitration agreement on the facts of a particular case excludes either expressly or by necessary implication the substitution of an arbitrator, whether named or otherwise, such a substitution must take place. In fact, sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 15 also throw considerable light on the correct construction of sub-section (2). Under sub-section (3), when an arbitrator is replaced, any hearings previously held by the replaced arbitrator may or may not be repeated at the discretion of the newly appointed Tribunal, unless parties have agreed otherwise. Equally, orders or rulings of the earlier arbitral Tribunal are not to be invalid only because there has been a change in the composition of the earlier Tribunal, subject, of course, to a contrary agreement by parties. This also indicates that the object of speedy resolution of disputes by arbitration would best be sub-served by a substitute arbitrator continuing at the point at which the earlier arbitrator has left off.\n\n(2006) 6 SCC 204, (2009) 10 SCC 293, (2012) 7 SCC 71 Rel. on. [Para 20]\n\n Whenever parties agree for mediation, and even name a specific arbitrator with no specific provision for appointment of another arbitrator on the recusal/withdrawal of the said arbitrator, the said omission is made up by Section 15(2) of the Act and unless arbitration agreement between the parties provides a categorical prohibition or debarment in resolving a question or dispute or difference between the parties by a substitute arbitrator in case of death or the named arbitrator or non availability of the said arbitrator, Courts have the power to appoint substitute arbitrator, which power is given by Section 15(2) of the Act as this provision is to be given liberal interpretation so as to apply to all possible circumstances under which the mandate of the earlier arbitrator may be terminated.

Certain requirements had to be satisfied for a judicial authority to refer the parties to Arbitration under the Act of 1940. Firstly a party to the legal proceedings could at any time before the filing of written statement or taking another step in the proceedings, apply to the judicial authority for stay of the proceedings.  Consequently the Judicial authority had to be satisfied that there was no sufficient reason why matter should not be referred in accordance with arbitration agreement and that the applicant, was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration.  On being satisfied, such authority had to make an order staying the proceedings.  It is clear from the language of Section 34 that Judicial authority or court was not obliged or bound to refer the parties to arbitration. There was discretion in the court.  Even if the applicant satisfied the requirements, namely of applying before filing of written statement or taking any steps in the proceedings and also expressing intent or desire to be ready and willing to comply with all necessary things for the proper conduct of the arbitration, the court could refuse to stay the suit.  The language of Section 8 of the Act of 1996 is on the other hand mandatory.

It seems to have gone to the extent of permitting the State's counsel to file some documents in appeal.\n\n\tThe High Court then went on to examine the case on facts and eventually held that the arbitrator has travelled beyond clauses 26, 3 (1)(a) and 1.46 of the agreement and hence committed legal misconduct requiring the High Court to set aside the award such approach is wholly against the law laid down by Apex Court in the various decisions.\n\n\tIn the first place, the High Court did not apply the law laid down by this Court while deciding the appeal and hence committed a jurisdictional error; Secondly, the High Court acted like an appellate Court and virtually treated as if the appeal arose directly against the award and then proceeded to examine all factual findings of the arbitrator by appreciating the evidence. It was not permissible in law; Thirdly, the High Court should have confined its inquiry to find out as to whether any legal misconduct was committed by the arbitrator and, if so, how and in what manner. It was, however, not done; Fourthly, the High Court went into the factual question by referring to clause 26 of the agreement for holding that the arbitrator passed an award contrary to clause 26 and thereby traveled beyond the terms of agreement which constituted a legal misconduct on his part. This finding, in our view, is, on the face of it, untenable in law for the reason, inter alia, that this objection was neither raised before the arbitrator and nor before the Trial Court in the manner in which it was raised for the first time in the High Court. In any event, in the absence of any finding recorded by the arbitrator and the Trial Court, such issue could not have been gone into for the first time in appeal by the High Court. That apart, it has otherwise no substance on facts for the simple reason that it being a question of fact, the same could not be examined in appeal; Fifthly, the High Court failed to see that clause 26 only prohibits the appellant from assigning the agreement to any third person. Clause 26, therefore, had nothing to do with the claims filed by the appellants. It was an admitted fact that the appellant did not assign the agreement to any third person. If some work was got done by the appellant by employing some small contractor then it did not constitute a case of assignment of a whole agreement in favour of small contractors within the meaning of clause 26 so as to empower the State to cancel the agreement on such ground. The finding of the High Court that the award is rendered bad because it was passed in contravention of clause 26 of the agreement is, therefore, not legally sustainable in law; Sixthly, the High Court further failed to see that there was no error apparent on the face of the record in the findings recorded by the arbitrator; Seventhly, the High Court also failed to see that the Trial Court had elaborately gone into all the factual issues and rightly did not find any substance in the objections raised by the respondent; and lastly, the award being a reasoned one the reasoning of the arbitrator could not be said to be perverse to the extent that no man with ordinary prudence could take such view and nor any finding of the arbitrator was against any provision of law or in contravention of any of the clauses of the agreement so as to constitute a case of legal misconduct on the part of the arbitrator within the meaning of Section 30 of the Act for setting aside an award. \t\t\t\t [Para 34,35,36,37]"

This cannot be said to be observation of general application. Rather, it would depend upon the stipulation in the contract in each case whether power of Arbitrator to grant pendente lite interest is expressly taken away. If answer is 'yes' then Arbitrator would have no power to award pendente lite interest.\n\n\tThe decision in Madnani Construction Corporation 2010(1) ALL MR 460 (S.C.), has followed decision in Engineers-De-Space-Age (supra). Same is also required to be diluted to the extent that express stipulation under contract may debar the Arbitrator from awarding interest pendente lite. Grant of pendente lite interest may depend upon several factors such as phraseology used in the agreement, clauses conferring power relating to arbitration, nature of claim and dispute referred to Arbitrator and on what items power to award interest has been taken away and for which period.\n\n\tThus, if contract expressly bars award of interest pendente lite, the same cannot be awarded by the Arbitrator. It is also made clear that the bar to award interest on delayed payment by itself will not be readily inferred as express bar to award interest pendente lite by the Arbitral Tribunal, as ouster of power of Arbitrator has to be considered on various relevant aspects referred to in various decisions of Supreme Court. \t\t\t\t [Para 22,23,24]"

There is a distinction between disputes as to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator and the disputes as to in what way that jurisdiction should be exercised. The distinction has to be drawn between an error within the jurisdiction and an error in excess of jurisdiction. An award may be remitted or set aside on the ground that the arbitrator making it had exceeded his jurisdiction. An award can be set aside where there is error apparent on the face thereof, i.e. if there is any proposition of law which is apparent on the face thereof and is erroneous and made basis for it. The Court in dealing with the application to set aside an award is not to consider whether the view of the arbitrator on the evidence is justified. The arbitrator's adjudication is generally considered binding between the parties, for he is a tribunal selected by the parties and the power of the Court to set aside the award is restricted to cases set out in Section 30 of the act. Needless to say that the Court has no appellate jurisdiction in deciding the petition to set aside an award under Section 30 of the Act.  [Para 6]"

Loss suffered due to flooding. Surveyor appointed, submitted final report. Respondent protested for taking sum insured and delay tactics. Respondent under pressure signed and gave undated discharge voucher and payment was released by Appellant. Arbitrator appointed by High Court as dispute existed regarding discharge voucher and its signing voluntarily or under pressure or coercion. In further appeal, held, when a respondent contends that the dispute is not arbitrable on account of discharge of the contract under a settlement agreement or discharge voucher or no-claim certificate, and the claimant contends that it was obtained by fraud, coercion or under influence, the issue will have to be decided either by the Chief Justice/his designate in the proceedings under section 11 of the Act or by the arbitral Tribunal as directed by the order under section 11 of the Act. A claim for arbitration cannot be rejected merely or solely on ground that a settlement agreement or discharge voucher has been executed by claimant and if its validity is disputed by claimant. If the party who has executed discharge agreement or discharge voucher alleges that its execution was on account of fraud/coercion/undue influence practiced by other party and is able to establish same, then obviously discharge of contract by such agreement/voucher is rendered void and cannot be acted upon. Any dispute raised by such party would be arbitrable. Receipt is undated, containing irrelevant, inappropriate statements, claimants required to sign on dotted line. Vouchers insisted and taken mechanically without application of mind. When discharge voucher was signed and given by Respondent payment had not been made. It was made after receiving voucher. Therefore, at time of signing voucher by Respondent and at time of its delivery to Appellant, contents of voucher that amount had been received in full and final settlement of all claims, in consideration of such payment, insurer was absolved from any further liability are all false and not supported by consideration. High Court rightly found prima facie no accord and satisfaction or discharge of contract. Appeal dismissed. It is open to Appellant to lead evidence before Arbitrator to establish that there was valid and binding discharge of contract by way of accord and satisfaction.  [Para 2,18,28,29,30,31]"

It was submitted that section 37(3) was not argued before the learned arbitrators.  This is a dangerous ground to entertain while considering a challenge to an award.  It is not open to the court to draw an inference on the basis of circumstances extraneous to the award, as to what was argued or not argued before the arbitrators.  For instance, though this point was argued before us and Respondent No.1 has dealt with it in its written submission, the Appellants themselves have omitted to mention the same in their written submissions. Similarly, there are other aspects which though discussed in Court, do not find place in the written submissions.  Nor is it open to us to presume that the arbitrators did not consider any particular evidence or any legal provisions while arriving at their conclusions.  It may be a different matter where the question is whether a case was pleaded at all. This may entitle the Court to read the record before the arbitrators.  The Court is not concerned with such a case here. While it is necessary to plead facts and circumstances which save the bar of limitation, it is not necessary to plead that the claim is not barred by limitation if the facts pleaded show the same.  The letter dated 28.10.1987 was referred to in and annexed as Exhibit 24 to the statement of claim and was set out in extenso in the majority award.

The real question for consideration is whether such an award amounts to creation of or transfer of any fresh rights in movable or immovable properties so as to bring it within the ambit of Section 17 of the Registration Act? A perusal of the award shows that it is simply a case of distribution of assets of the dissolved firm amongst the partners themselves. A partnership firm is not an independent legal entity, the partners are the real owners of the assets of the partnership firm. Actually the firm name is only a compendious name given to the partnership for sake of convenience. The assets of the partnership belong to and are owned by the partners of the firm. So long as partnership continues each partner is interested in all the assets of the partnership firm as each partner is owner of the assets to the extent of his share in the partnership. On dissolution of the partnership firm, accounts are settled amongst the partners and the assets of the partnership are distributed amongst the partners as per their respective shares in the partnership firm. Thus, on dissolution of a partnership firm, the allotment of assets to individual partner is not a case of transfer of any assets of the firm. The assets which hereinbefore belonged to each partner, will after dissolution of the firm stand allotted to the partners individually. There is no transfer or assignment of ownership in any of the assets. This is the legal consequence of distribution of assets on dissolution of a partnership firm. The distribution of assets may be done either by way of an arbitration award or by mutual settlement between the partners themselves. The document which records the settlement in this case is an award which does not require registration under Section 17 of the Registration Act since the document does not transfer or assign interest in any asset.

Once such a notice is given it merely has to be accepted by the Government of India.  The moment it is accepted the retirement would become effective.  If any other view is taken it would lead to absurd results.  Such a view would mean that even though a member had given a notice for voluntary retirement, stopped attending office and/or gone away abroad and/or taken up some other employment after a number of years of absence the member could claim to come back into service because the Government, for some unforeseen reasons, had not communicated its acceptance.  Taken to its absurd length such a member could after superannuation claim that, as the services were not terminated, he was entitled to pension and gratuity on the basis that he had continued in service.  The requirement of communication of acceptance would only arise in cases where, even after giving of a notice of voluntary retirement the member continues to work/perform his duties.  In such cases the member would need to know from what date he can stop attending office.  In cases where the member has by his own conduct abandoned service the severance of the relationship of master and servant takes place immediately on acceptance of notice.  No provision or rule could be shown which requires such acceptance to be gazetted.  [Para 26]"

Admittedly, the petitioner joined the services on 26.6.1975 in the Department of Transport under the then Union territory of Goa and was promoted as Motor Vehicles Inspector in the year 1984. Since he was promoted as Assst. Director of Transport in the Transport Department of Goa on regular post on 15.1.1992, it is apparent that his services rendered prior to the appointed day i.e. 30th May, 1987 have been taken into consideration by the State of Goa. He has been continued in service by virtue of the above statutory provisions and unless and until it is demonstrated that his services have been governed after the appointed day by different set of rules which replace the CCS(CCA) Rules and Conduct Rules or modified or substituted them in some manner, one has to proceed on the basis that the Rules applicable to the petitioner continue to remain in force. That such Rules are not replaced or superseded by any Rules is also an admitted position. In such circumstances, the Central Rules which have been made pursuant to the Constitutional provision referred to in Chapter I of Part XIV of the Constitution of India, they cannot be said to be straight away inapplicable, the moment Goa State is established or the Goa Reorganisation Act is brought into effect or force. If such had been the Legislative intent, it would have expressed it in clearest terms. On the other hand, it is to the contrary. It does not provide that the Central Rules are inapplicable after the services of the petitioner have been made over to the State of Goa. In such circumstances, the inquiry which was initiated under the Central Rules is not null, void and totally without jurisdiction.  [Para 32]"

                "description": "Civil P.C. (1908), S.2 - Insolvency notice - Cannot be issued on basis of an arbitration award - Award is neither a decree nor an order for payment within meaning of S.9(2).\n\nIssuance of a notice under the Insolvency Act is fraught with serious consequences: it is intended to bring about a drastic change in the status of the person against whom a notice is issued viz. to declare him an insolvent with all the attendant disabilities.  Therefore, firstly, such a notice was intended to be issued only after a regularly constituted court, a component of judicial organ established for the dispensation of justice, has passed a decree or order for the payment of money.  Secondly, a notice under the Insolvency Act is not a mode of enforcing a debt; enforcement is done by taking steps for execution available under the CPC for realizing moneys.   [Para 56]\n\nThe words \"as if\" demonstrate that award and decree or order are two different things.  The legal fiction created is for the limited purpose of enforcement as a decree.  The fiction is not intended to make it a decree for all purposes under all statutes, whether State or Central.   [Para 57]\n\nHence following conclusions follow :-\n\ni)\t that no insolvency notice can be issued under Section 9(2) of the Presidency Towns Insolvency Act, 1909 on the basis of an Arbitration Award;\n\nii)\tthat execution proceedings in respect of the award cannot be proceeded with in view of the statutory stay under Section 22 of the SICA Act.  As such, no insolvency notice is liable to be issued against the appellant.\n\niii)\tInsolvency Notice cannot be issued on an Arbitration Award.\n\niv)\tAn arbitration award is neither a decree nor an Order for payment within the meaning of Section 9(2).  The expression \"decree\" in the Court Fees Act, 1870 is liable to be construed with reference to its definition in the CPC and held that there are essential conditions for a \"decree\".\n\n(a)\tthat the adjudication must be given in a suit.\n\n(b)\tThat the suit must start with a plaint and culminate in a decree, and\n\n(c)\tThat the adjudication must be formal and final and must be given by a civil or revenue Court.\n\nAn award does not satisfy any of the requirements of a decree.  It is not rendered in a suit nor is an arbitral proceeding commenced by the institution of a plaint.\n\n(v)\tA legal fiction ought not to be extended beyond its legitimate field.  As such, an award rendered under the provisions of the Arbitration Act, 1996 cannot be construed to be a \"decree\" for the purpose of Section 9(2) of the Insolvency Act.\n\n(vi)\tAn insolvency notice should be in strict compliance with the requirements in Section 9(3) and the Rules made thereunder.\n\n(vii)\tIt is a well established rule that a provision must be construed in a manner which would give effect to its purpose and to cure the mischief in the light of which it was enacted.  The object of Section 22, in protecting guarantors from legal proceedings pending a reference to BIFR of the principal debtor, is to ensure that a scheme for rehabilitation would not be defeated by isolated proceedings adopted against the guarantors of a sick company.  To achieve that purpose, it is imperative that the expression \"suit\" in Section 22 be given its plain meaning, namely any proceedings adopted for realization of a right vested in a party by law.  This would clearly include arbitration proceedings.\n\n(viii)\tIn any event, award which is incapable of execution cannot form the basis of an insolvency notice.\t [Para 58]"

                "description": "Arbitration Act (1940) - Arbitration proceedings - Will not come under expression \"other proceedings\" of S.69(3) of Partnership Act - The ban imposed u/S.69 can have no application to arbitral proceedings as well as arbitration award.\n\nA close reading of sub-Sections (1) and (2)of S.69 of Partnership Act therefore shows that while under sub-section (1) the ban is as against filing a suit in a Court by any person as a partner of an unregistered firm against the firm itself or any of its partner, under sub-section (2) such a ban in the same form of a suit in the Court will also operate against any third party at the instance of such an unregistered firm. The common feature in both the sub-sections are filing of a suit, in a Court for the enforcement of a right arising from a contract or conferred by the Partnership Act either on behalf of an unregistered firm or by the firm itself or by anyone representing as partners of such an unregistered firm. While under sub-section (1) the ban imposed would operate against the firm itself or any of its partners, under sub-section (2) the ban would operate against any third party. The question then arises is that by virtue of sub-section (3) whether the expression \"other proceedings\" contained therein will include Arbitral proceedings and can be equated to a suit filed in a Court and thereby the ban imposed against an unregistered firm can operate in the matter of arbitral proceedings. If sub-sections (1) and (2) are virtually lifted whole hog and incorporated in sub-section (3), it must be stated that it is not the mere ban that is imposed in sub-sections (1) and (2) that alone is contemplated for the application of sub-section (3). In other words, when the whole of the ingredients contained in sub-sections (1) and (2) are wholly incorporated in sub-section (3), the resultant position would be that the ban can operate in respect of an unregistered firm even relating to a set off or other proceedings only when such claim of set off or other proceedings are intrinsically connected with the suit that is pending in a Court. To be more precise, the condition precedent for the operation of ban under sub-section (3) is that the launching of a suit in a Court of law should be present and it should be by an unregistered firm or by a person claiming to be partner of an unregistered firm either to a claim for set off in the said suit or any other proceedings intrinsically connected with the said suit. In the event of the above ingredients set out under sub-sections (1), (2) and (3) being fulfilled then and then alone the ban prescribed against an unregistered firm under Section 69(1), (2) and (3) would operate and not otherwise.\n\n\tIn the instant case the contract between the parties contained an Arbitration Clause. The respondent invoked the said clause and an Arbitrator came to be appointed. After the respondent filed its statement of claim, the appellant filed its reply and also its counter claim dated 30.08.2003. Before the Arbitrator, in the course of oral arguments, a faint attempt was made contending that, the appellant-firm being an unregistered one, by virtue of Section 69 of the Partnership Act, the proceedings insofar as the counter claim was concerned, the same was not maintainable and should be rejected. The Arbitrator took the correct view that Section 69 has no application to the proceedings of the Arbitrator and held that the objection of the respondent was not sustainable. To sum up, held that Arbitral Proceedings will not come under the expression \"other proceedings\" of Section 69(3) of the Partnership Act, the ban imposed under the said Section 69 can have no application to Arbitral proceedings as well as the Arbitration Award.\n1964(8) SCR 50, (2000) 6 SCC 659 Rel. on.\t\t [Para 11,12,13,14,18,36]"

In summation, Section 41(1) of the Act of 1882 is a special law which in turn has constituted special Courts for adjudication of disputes specified therein between the licensor and licensee or a landlord and tenant. The effect of Section 41(2) of the Act of 1882 is only the suits or proceedings for recovery of possession of immovable property or of licence fee thereof, to which, the provisions of specified Acts or any other law for the time being in force apply, have been excepted from the application of non-obstante clause contained in Section 41(1) of the Act. The expression \"or any other law for the time being in force\" appearing in Section 41(2) will have to be construed to mean that such law should provide for resolution of disputes between licensor and licensee or a landlord and tenant in relation to immovable property or licence fee thereof, to which immovable property, the provisions of that Act are applicable. The Act of 1996 is not covered within the ambit of Section 41(2) in particular the expression \"or any other law for the time being in force\" contained therein. The question whether the exclusive jurisdiction of the Small Causes Court vested in terms of Section 41 of the Act of 1882 is ousted, if an agreement between the licensor and licensee contains a clause for arbitration, the same will have to be answered in the negative. For, Section 5 of the Act of 1996 in that sense is not an absolute non-obstante clause. Section 5 of the Act of 1996 cannot affect the laws for the time being in force by virtue of which certain disputes may not be submitted to arbitration, as stipulated in Section 2(3) of the Act of 1996. Section 41 of the Act of 1882 falls within the ambit of Section 2(3) of the Act of 1996. As a result of which, even if the Licence Agreement contains Arbitration Agreement, the exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts of Small Causes under Section 41 of the Act of 1882 is not affected in any manner. Whereas, Arbitration Agreement in such cases would be invalid and in-operative on the principle that it would be against public policy to allow the parties to contract out of the exclusive jurisdiction of the Small Causes Courts by virtue of Section 41 of the Act of 1882.\t [Para 39,40]\n\nInspite of Arbitration Agreement between the parties and non-obstante clause in Section 5 of the Act of 1996, the exclusive jurisdiction of the Small Causes Court to try and decide the dispute specified in Section 41 of the Act of 1882 is not ousted.

                "description": "Powers of Board - Suspending operation of arbitration award - Order can be passed by Board - Provisions of SICA would be applicable despite section 5 of 1996 Act.\n\nPer S. B. Sinha, J.:-\t\tThe Board exercises statutory functions.  It is a quasi judicial authority.  It exercises various powers under the Civil P.C.  For the purpose of the 1996 Act it is a judicial authority.  The expression 'judicial authority' must be interpreted having regard to the purport and object for which the 1996 Act was enacted.  The Board is a judicial authority within the meaning of Section 5 of the 1996 Act.  A power to pass an interim order, however, and that too directing disposal of the assets must be found out in the scheme of the statute itself.  Although the Courts of limited jurisdiction may also possess by necessary implication incidental power so as to enable it to direct preservation of property during the pendency of a proceeding before it, it is doubtful whether such incidental power can be exercised for sale of assets of the company.  [Para 27,28,31]\n\nWhen an award is made under 1996 Act, an application under S.34 is required to be filed questioning the validity thereof.  Once such an application is filed, it remains under suspension in the sense that it would not be enforceable.  Only upon expiry of the period specified in Section 34 to challenge an award or when such objection is refused, the same would become enforceable.  Section 36 merely specifies as to how such an award can be enforced by laying down that it can be enforced as if it were a decree.  The legal fiction created under Section 36 has limited application.  An award is to be treated to be decree even without intervention of Court only for purpose of its enforceability.  Thus, an order can be passed by the Board for suspending the operation of the award if any occasion arises therefor.  [Para 40,42]\n\nMoreover, a statutory distinction has been made by the Legislature as regards suspension of a proceeding, on the one hand, and initiation and/or continuance thereof, on the other.  Whereas in the former case the statutory impact would be automatic, in the latter the Court is required to apply its mind having regard to facts and circumstances of each case.  When an order is passed by the Board in exercise of its jurisdiction under sub-section (3) of Section 22 directing the parties not to continue the proceeding, an award or decree is not set aside thereby.  They are merely kept in abeyance so as to enable the Board to pass an appropriate order, inter alia, for revival of a sick company for the purpose of giving effect to the purport and object for which the laws relating to corporate insolvency have been enacted.  Section 5 also provides for a non-obstante clause.  It has, however, a limited application aiming at the extent of judicial intervention.  Its application would be attracted only when an order under sub-section (3) of Section 22 is required to be passed.  If the said provision is to be given effect to, the Board would not intervene in the matter of the implementation of the award.  It would merely suspend the operation of it.  It may even pass an order suspending the liabilities or obligations of the industrial company under the award. \t\t\t\t\t        [Para 50,67]\n\nSub-section (3) of Section 22, SICA provides for a specific power in the Board.  The said provision contemplates a larger public interest.  In the event an arbitral award is held to be outside the purview of sub-section (3) of Section 22 thereof, it may be difficult to frame a scheme or in a given case implement the same under SICA.  SICA provides for a time-frame for all the stages of proceedings.  Proviso appended thereto assumes significance in this behalf.  The Parliament presumed that the suspension of an award shall not be for a long period.  In a given case, a party to an award may face some hardships owing to its suspension; but in such an event, it would always be open to it to bring the same to the notice of the Board.  The Board under sub-section (3) of Section 22 of SICA may pass such an order or may not do so.  If an order is passed by the Board, an appeal lies thereagainst.  The provisions of SICA, it will bear repetition to state, have been made to seek to achieve a higher goal and, thus, the provisions of SICA would be applicable, despite Section 5 of the 1996 Act. \t [Para 69,70]\n\nPer P. K. Balasubramanyan, J.:-\tIf on its understanding of Section 22(3) of SICA, the High Court was of the view that the orders of restraint did not bar the BIFR from considering the prayer of the respondent, there was still the order of A.A.I.F.R. to maintain status quo regarding the assets of the respondent-Company.  Surely, that was an order under the SICA.  No reason is given by the High Court to hold that the order of A.A.I.F.R. is also not binding on B.I.F.R. or that B.I.F.R. could ignore it.  The High Court should have dealt with the question properly with reference to the nature of the relevant orders and the context in which they were made and if it was still of the view that the power vested in B.I.F.R. under Section 22(3) of SICA enabled it to override all those orders, it should have normally remitted the application made by the respondent to B.I.F.R. so as to enable it to take a decision on the prayer of the respondent in the context of the proceedings pending before B.I.F.R. and all elements relevant for the purpose of such a decision.  [Para 76]\n\nOccasions are not infrequent when not so scrupulous debtors approach B.I.F.R. to stall the proceedings and to keep their creditors at bay.  The delay before the B.I.F.R. is sought to be taken advantage of.  The Parliament has apparently taken note of this and has repealed SICA by the Sick Industrial Companies (Special Provisions) Repeal Act, 2003.  The vacuum, thus created has been filled by an amendment to the Companies Act.  But, so far, the provisions of the Amending Act and the Companies Act introduced, have not been brought into force.  It appears to be time to consider whether these enactments should not be notified.  [Para 77]"

The cross-examination of the witnesses/ deponents of the petitioners would, therefore aid the Court in arriving at a conclusion whether the reasons mentioned by the petitioners in their applications under Section 149/151 of the C.P.C. commend acceptance. It is also required to be borne in mind that the deficit court fee is in respect of the applications filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 for which the limitation is prescribed by the Arbitration Act, 1996 itself. Hence, having regard to the principles governing the exercise of jurisdiction under Section 149 of the C.P.C., and considering the fact that the issue of deficit court fees has arisen in respect of the applications filed under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996, it cannot be said that the said issue is only between the petitioners and the Government. Therefore, the Court, whilst adjudicating upon the applications filed by the petitioners under Section 149/151 of the C.P.C., is required to consider as to whether on the touchstone of the reasons mentioned by the petitioners, discretion is required to be exercised in favour of the petitioners. The impugned order permitting the cross-examination of the witnesses/ deponents of the petitioners cannot be found fault with. The same can only aid the Court in arriving at a decision as to whether to exercise discretion in favour of the petitioners or not.      [Para 11]"

In this regard, it would be worthwhile to note that under section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, Parliament has limited the challenges to an award on the grounds stated therein.\n\nIt is clear from section 34 that the legal misconduct is not one of the grounds provided by that section for setting aside an award. Having regard to the policy of law of making an award immune from challenge on that ground, it would not be open for the Court while executing a decree or considering an objection to its execution to entertain a challenge to the decree on grounds not provided for in the Act, barring something in the nature of fraud or nullity which goes to the foundation of the award or decree.  [Para 16]\n\nIt is well-known that the award under the Act of 1940 could be set aside, vide section 30 thereof, inter alia, on the ground that the Arbitrator has misconducted himself or the proceedings.

Work was awarded to petitioner under agreement with respondent. Disputes were referred to arbitration and award was passed. Petitioner filed Arbitration petition under S.34 challenging directions given in operative part of award before Original Side of this Court. Respondents also filed Arbitration Petition invoking identical powers in relation to same award at Thane District Court.\n\nWhether under old Act or new Act term 'Court' is defined to mean Civil Court. Applications under S.34 of Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 are 'Proceedings' before Civil Court. They are instituted in Court subordinate to this Court. It is not disputed that Applications before Thane District Court filed by Respondents are on footing that according to them that is Court within meaning of S.2(e) of Arbitration and Conciliation Act. If that is case then S.24 of CPC is fully applicable in this case. Court can transfer applications pending before District Court, Thane provided it is satisfied that simultaneous trial will result in conflicting orders and equally parties would be inconvenienced if they have to proceed and argue more or less similar issues twice over.\n\nS.34 of 1996 Act falling in Chapter VII provides for application for setting aside arbitral award.

These provisions in 1996 Act do not rule out applicability of S.24 of CPC.\n\nOnce SC holds that term 'proceedings' is used in widest and comprehensive term and would include every adjudication before Court, then, it is clear that proceedings under S.34 of 1996 Act being filed in Civil Court, power to transfer them are vested in terms of S.24 of CPC in District Court or High Court. There is nothing in 1996 Act which would rule out applicability of S.24 of CPC. On other hand in order to avoid conflicting Judgments and Orders, when same parties challenged same Award but in different Civil Courts, power of transfer will only further object of resolution of disputes by recourse to arbitration.\n\nAIR 1966 SC 1888 Rel. on. \t\t\t\t\t\t   [Para 20,25,26]"

Having provided for an appeal, the forum of appeal is left \"to the Court authorized by law to hear appeals from such orders\".

Thus, a lawful agreement to refer the matter to arbitration can be made a condition precedent before going to courts and it does not violate S.28. No cause of action then accrues until the Arbitrator has made the award and the only amount awarded in such arbitration is recoverable in respect of the dispute so referred.\n\nS.31(7)(a) of the 1996 Act which allows parties to waive any claim to interest including pendente lite and the power of the Arbitrator to grant interest is subject to the agreement of the parties. Interest payments are governed in general by the Interest Act, 1978 in addition to the specific statutes that govern an impugned matter. The provisions of S.3(3) of the Interest Act, 1978 explicitly allows the parties to waive their claim to an interest by virtue of an agreement. S.3(3)(a)(ii) states that the Interest Act will not apply to situations where the payment of interest is \u201cbarred by virtue of an express agreement\u201d. Thus, when there is an express statutory permission for the parties to contract out of receiving interest and they have done so without any vitiation of free consent, it is not open for the Arbitrator to grant pendent lite interest.

In the said proceedings the arbitrator added another bank as a party. Said newly added bank was a registered mortgagee in respect of the immovable properties of borrower. Both the disputant bank and the newly added bank were claimants in respect of properties of borrower. The arbitrator framed specific issues with regard to the charge claimed by such newly added bank and held that disputant bank is entitled to share with newly added bank the sale proceeds of immovable properties of borrower.\n\nKeeping in view the limited scope of arbitration proceedings under S.84 of MSCS Act High Court held, no third person or party can be permitted to proceed against in such proceedings. The Arbitrator has no jurisdiction to entertain and consider the claim of disputant bank as against some other bank which is not the member of disputant bank. The scope of jurisdiction under Section 84, is quite limited and cannot be extended in such fashion against the party who is not the member. Therefore, there was no question of passing and/or giving any declarative award in respect of the charges. The Arbitrator just cannot go beyond the definite jurisdiction under the MSCS Act, basically against the person who is not the member of the Disputant Bank.\n\n2008(1) ALL MR 232 Ref. to. \t\t\t\t\t\t            [Para 9,10]"

To insist appellants to pay higher court fee in order to prosecute appeal under S.37 of said Act would amount to impairing right of appeal by imposing more onerous and stringent conditions. Provision of S.3A of Bombay Court Fees Act cannot be construed to operate retrospectively in absence of any specific intention of Legislature to that effect so as to require appellants to pay court fee in terms thereof. Provision will operate prospectively to all such cases where applications under S.34 of said Act have been filed after 1-9-2009. Applications in question under S.34 of said Act were filed on 14-3-2005 and hence provision of S.3A of Bombay Court Fees Act is not at all attracted in this case.

In relation to goods, the seller must ship goods of contract description on board a ship bound to the contract destination. If there is a late shipment or the seller has put goods on board a ship not bound to the contract destination as stipulated, the logical inference that must necessarily follow is that the seller has not put on board goods conforming to a contract destination. In this case the sellers breached the terms of the contract at the very threshold by late shipment of goods and by loading on board the vessel which was no longer to reach the port of Novorossiysk as the first port of discharge. The sellers having breached the terms of the C.I.F. contract at the threshold, it is very difficult to hold that property in the goods got transferred out and out to the buyers on shipment of the goods or when the shipping documents were handed over to the bank for negotiations of Letter of Credit. In a case such as this one, the sellers' failure to discharge the primary obligation under the contract regarding the shipment of goods can be held to have resulted in postponement of transfer of title in goods to the buyers. There is no merit in the case set up by the sellers that their liability ceased to exist on shipment of the goods or in any case when the shipping documents were handed over through the banking channels on negotiations of Letter of Credit. In the present case, the sellers were in breach at the threshold, it is immaterial whether or not the buyers had a right of action against the insurers or carrier. \t\t\t\t     [Para 21,24]\n\nThe stipulation for reimbursement is not in the nature of penalty; the clause is not in terrorem. It is neither punitive nor vindictive. Moreover, what has been provided in the contract is the reimbursement of the price of the goods paid by the buyers to the sellers. The clause of reimbursement or repayment in the event of delayed delivery/arrival or non-delivery is not to be regarded as damages. Even in the absence of such clause, where the seller has breached his obligations at threshold, the buyer is entitled to the return of the price paid and for damages. There is no reason why the sellers should not be bound by it and the court should not enforce such term. No way the clause is in the nature of threat held over the sellers in terror.\t\t\t\t\t    [Para 29]\n\nHaving regard to the subject matter of the contract, the clause for reimbursement or repayment in the circumstances provided therein is neither unreasonable nor unjust; far from being extravagant or unconscionable. It is the precise sum which the sellers are required to reimburse to the buyers, which they had received for the goods, in case of the non-arrival of the goods within the prescribed time. More so, the fact of the matter is that goods never arrived at the port of discharge. The Arbitral Tribunal has only awarded reimbursement of half the price paid by the buyers to the sellers and, therefore, the award cannot be held to be unjust, unreasonable or unconscionable or contrary to the public policy of India. \t\t\t\t\t\t    [Para 31]"

[Para 24]\n\nIt is thus clear that the law governing an application to set aside an award is the law governing the arbitration agreement i.e. the proper law of the arbitration agreement. It is clear from the contract in the instant case that the arbitration agreement is contained in one of the clauses of the contract and not a separate agreement. The governing law of the contract being the English Law, it is that system of law which must necessarily govern the arbitration agreement and its enforcement in the absence of any indication of the contrary. In the instant case, thus the proper law of the arbitration agreement is the same as the proper law of the underlying contract, which, as mentioned above, is the English Law. \n2002(4) SCC 105 Rel. on.  [Para 28,31]\n\nIn view of the provisions of the English Arbitration Act set out in Paragraph 32 and 33 above and the seat of the arbitration in the case herein being admittedly in England, the award made can only be challenged before the courts in England according to the applicable English Law, namely, the English Arbitration Act, 1996. The Indian Law, namely, Part 1 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 clearly stands excluded so far as challenge to an arbitration award is concerned. Once the parties to the contract incorporate a clause to the effect that any dispute arising out of the contract shall be referred to the Refined Sugar Association, such dispute must be settled in accordance with the Rules relating to Arbitration and English Arbitration Act, 1996. Therefore even on this analysis it is clear that this Court does not have jurisdiction to entertain the present Petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.  [Para 34,36]"

The departure is made in the present Act clearly with a view that spokes should not be put in passing the Arbitral Award by raising such pleas.  Those sections are clear in that respect.  There is no provision like Section 5 of the Act of 1940, in the present Act of 1996.  Further Section 12,13 and 16 fall in part I and Section  5 of the 1996 Act. mandates that no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided by that  part.  [Para 9]\n\nThe effect of the conjoint reading of these 2 section his that if such a plea of bias is not raised as per Section 13, then party cannot raise it later on for challenging the award under Section 34.  If it is raised, rejected and arbitral award is passed against that party then it can challenge it under Section 34.\n\nPerusal of section 16 also shows the same type of anxiety on the part of the legislature that the party to the proceedings should not delay the same. Section 16 dealing with competence of arbitral tribunal has to rule on its jurisdiction and power is given to it.  If the arbitral tribunal comes to the conclusion that it has jurisdiction to decide it, then it is to proceed for the award.  Under section 16(6) an aggrieved party is given a right to challenge award on that ground, in accordance with Section 34.  If such a plea of jurisdiction is not raised at this stage then it cannot be raised under Section 34.  However both under Section 13 and 16, a party cannot file such a petition unless the procedure contemplated thereby is followed.  It can also be noted that if the arbitral tribunal accepts the plea about lack of its jurisdiction or that certain dispute is beyond the scope of its authority, an appeal lies from such order to court under Section 37 (2(a).

Unlike Section 8 which provides that the application shall be moved not later than when submitting the first statement of the substance of the dispute, under Section 45 there is no such limitation.  All that Section 45 says is that when a judicial authority is seized of an action in a matter in respect of which parties had made an agreement for arbitration the judicial authority at the request of one of the parties or any person claiming through them or under him refer the parties to arbitration, unless it finds that the said agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.  Prima-facie, therefore, there seems to be no time limit within which such an application can be made.  A further aspect of the matter is that even if Section 45 is invoked, the Civil Court would continue to have jurisdiction until it decides whether the arbitration agreement is void, inoperative or unlawful.  It is only after recording such a finding will the issue of jurisdiction be answered.   [Para 6]\n\nConsidering the language of Section 45 which uses the expression at the request of one of the parties, would mean that the attention of the Court is invited to the arbitral clause with a request to direct the parties to arbitration.  This would mean that a formal application is made to the Court so that the other side and the Court knows why the request under Section 45 is made.  [Para 6]\n\nThe plaintiff had filed a suit for declaration that the agreements between the parties and arbitration agreements therein are illegal, null and void ab initio or inoperative and/or incapable of being performed. During pendency of the suit the defendants filed an application claiming that arbitration proceedings between the parties had culminated in passing of an Award and therefore the remedy of the plaintiff lies in opposing enforcement of the Award, and the Civil Court had ceased to have jurisdiction in the matter. There was really no application for interim relief in terms of the provisions of the Code of Civil Procedure.  The petitioner defendant also did not apply to the Court for framing of issue as to jurisdiction and to get the same decided as that can be done on pleading being completed and issues being framed.  In the instant case based on the pleadings in the application the trial Court was called upon not to proceed with the suit or hear any interim application restraining enforcement of the arbitration award and attachment before judgment considering that an award has been passed and hence it ceased to have jurisdiction.  The trial Court was therefore, justified in rejecting the application, since the defendants had not moved application under S.45 for referring the dispute to arbitration.  The Civil Court inspite of an arbitration agreement continues to have jurisdiction and that jurisdiction can only be ousted in a manner provided under Section 8 in the case of a domestic arbitration and in the manner provided under Section 45 or Section 54 in case of an international commercial arbitration, depending upon whether it is bound by the New York Convention or Geneva Convention.  The ultimate order of the trial Court, therefore, that it has jurisdiction cannot be faulted.\t [Para 6]"

Section 9(ii)(b), provides for an interim measure of protection for securing the amount in dispute in the arbitration. Sort of clarification it also provides that the court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose of and in relation to any proceeding before it.  Such provision as enacted in Section 9 is a provision that enables a party to apply for interim protection if action of the other party to the agreement providing for arbitration is either in breach of the terms of the agreement or is inequitable, unfair or in breach of natural justice.  The order under section 9(ii)(b) is in the nature of interim protection order.  In a special provision of the nature like section 9(ii)(b), exercise of power cannot be restricted by importing the provisions of Order 38 rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure as it is.  The obstructive conduct of the opposite party may be one of the relevant considerations for the court to consider the application under section 9(ii)(b).  The party seeking protection order under Section 9(ii)(b) ordinarily must place some material before the Court, besides the merits of the claim that order under section 9(ii)(b) is eminently needed to be passed as there is likelihood or an attempt to defeat the award, though as indicated above, the provisions of Order 38, Rule 5 C.P.C. are not required to be satisfied.  The statutory discretion given to the Court under Section 9(ii)(b) must be exercised judicially in accordance with established legal principles and having regard only to relevant considerations.\t [Para 10]"

The power conferred upon the Superintending Engineer of the Circle was in the nature of a departmental dispute resolution mechanism and was meant for expeditious sorting out of problems which could crop up during execution of the work. Since the Superintending Engineer was made overall in-charge of all works to be executed under the contract, he was considered by the parties to be the best person who could provide immediate resolution of any controversy relating to specifications, designs, drawings, quality of workmanship or material used, etc. It was felt that if all this was left to be decided by the regular civil Courts, the object of expeditious execution of work of the project would be frustrated. This is the primary reason why the Superintending Engineer of the Circle was entrusted with the task of taking decision on various matters.\n\nHeld the power conferred on superintending engineer did not involve adjudication of any dispute or lis between the State Government and the contractor. It would have been extremely anomalous to appoint him as Arbitrator to decide any dispute or difference between the parties and pass an award. How could he pass an award on any of the issues already decided by him? Suppose, he was to decline approval to the designs, drawings etc. or was to object to the quality of materials etc. and the contractor had a grievance against his decision, the task of deciding the dispute could not have been assigned to the Superintending Engineer. He could not be expected to make adjudication with an un-biased mind. Even if he may not be actually biased, the contractor will always have a lurking apprehension that his decision will not be free from bias. Therefore, there is an inherent danger in treating the Superintending Engineer as an Arbitrator. The High Court had rightly held that Clause 30 of B-I Agreement was not an Arbitration Agreement and the trial Court was not right in appointing the Chief Engineer as an Arbitrator.\n\n(1980) 2 SCC 341, 1998(2) ALL MR 667 (S.C.), (1999) 2 SCC 166 Rel. on.

If the Chief Justice is merely to direct the appointing authority to appoint the arbitrator/arbitrators in accordance with the procedure agreed upon by the parties, there would be no occasion to have regard to the considerations set out in sub-section (8) of Section 11 of the Act.

For this purpose the primary document is the Bill of Lading into which the arbitration clause in the Charter Party Agreement is to be read in the manner provided in the incorporation clause of the Bill of Lading. While ascertaining the intention of the parties attempt should be made to give meaning to the incorporation clause and to give effect to the same and not to invalidate or frustrate it giving a literal, pedantic and technical reading of the clause. If on a construction of the arbitration clause of the Charter Party Agreement as incorporated in the Bill of Lading it does not lead to inconsistency or insensibility or absurdity then effect should be given to the intention of the parties and the arbitration clause as agreed should be made binding on parties to the Bill of Lading. If the parties to the Bill of Lading being aware of the arbitration clause in the Charter Party Agreement have specifically incorporated the same in the conditions of the Bill of Lading then the intention of the parties to abide by the arbitration clause is clear. Whether a particular dispute arising between the parties comes within the purview of the arbitration clause as incorporated in the Bill of Lading is a matter to be decided by the arbitrator or the Court. But that does not mean that despite incorporation of the arbitration clause in the Bill of Lading by specific reference the parties had not intended that the disputes arising on the Bill of Lading should be resolved by arbitrator.\n\n(1977) 1 SCR 483, (1987) 1 SCC 615, AIR 1951, Cal 10 Ref.\t\t [Para 19]"

                "description": "Bye-laws of The Bombay Stock Exchange, Bye-laws, 248(a), 282 - Arbitration under any other enactment - Dispute between member and non-member - Incidental or connected claim against another member - Dispute can be referred for arbitration under bye-law 248 - Deprivation of an appeal would not be determinative factor in such a case.\n\nIf the scheme of the Bye-laws is to be construed in such a manner that dispute between member and non-member can only be referred to arbitration under Bye-law 248 and dispute between member and member can only be referred for arbitration under Bye-law 282, it would mean that if a member has a dispute with a non-member and a member, the member would necessarily have to split the claim and that part of the claim which would be against a non-member would be referred for arbitration under Bye-law 248 and that part which is against the member could be referred for arbitration under Bye-law 282.  Where, however, a member has some claim and seek a satisfaction of the claim jointly or severally against a member and a non-member the same would not be referable to arbitration either under Bye-law 248 or Bye-law 282.  Mr. Samdani, learned Counsel next submitted that if it is held that a claim against the member such as a Petitioner can be referred to arbitration under Bye-law 248 and decided in accordance therewith and not under Bye-law 282, it deprives the member of a right of an appeal.  That is clearly an inescapable consequence of holding that a member may be proceeded against under Bye-law 248(a).  It must, however, be remembered that it is the right of the Claimant to avail of one out of two or several remedies that may be available to him.  Where the Claimant elects to avail of a remedy under Bye-law 248 against the member and fails, he would be equally deprived of the two appeals which would be available had the reference been made under Bye-law 282.  The difficulty  that is posed namely the deprivation of an appeal in my mind would not be determinative factor in such a case.  What would determine the construction of the Bye-law in question would be whether the construction achieves the purpose for which it was designed.  If, in a dispute between a member and non-member an incidental or connected claim against another member cannot be referred for arbitration under Bye-law 248 and the Claimant is compelled to resort to two proceedings before different fora then the possibility of multiciplity of finding at variance in each other by different two fora cannot be ruled out.  In my view it would be most undesirable to adopt a construction which would bring about the possibility of two fora reaching different conclusion where the cause of action is based on same set of facts.  As noted above, the two fora are differently constituted and such a possibility cannot be ruled out.  In the circumstances, I am of the view that a claim against the member can be entertained under Bye-law 248 where the said claim is incidental to or connected to a claim against a non-member.

                "description": "Composition of Arbitral Tribunal - Number of arbitrators - Section 10 providing that number of arbitrators shall not be an even number is a derogable provision - If objection is not taken within time prescribed under S.16 there will be deemed waiver under S.4 - Composition of tribunal having been decided by consent of parties award cannot be set aside under S.34(2)(a)(v).\n\nArbitration is a creature of an agreement. There can be no arbitration unless there is an arbitration agreement in writing between the parties. \t\t [Para 14]\n\nIt is no longer open to contend that, under Section 16, a party cannot challenge the composition of the arbitral tribunal before the arbitral tribunal itself. Such a challenge must be taken, under Section 16(2), not later than the submission of the statement of defence. Section 16 (2) makes it clear that such a challenge can be taken even though the party may have participated in the appointment of the arbitrator and/or may have himself appointed the arbitrator. Needless to state a party would be free, if he so chooses, not to raise such a challenge. Thus a conjoint reading of Sections 10 and 16 shows that an objection to the composition of the arbitral tribunal is a matter which is derogable. It is derogable because a party is free not to object within the time prescribed in Section 16(2). If a party chooses not to so object there will be a deemed waiver under Section 4. Thus, we are unable to accept the submission that Section 10 is a non-derogable provision. In our view Section 10 has to be read along with Section 16 and is, therefore, a derogable provision. 2002(2) ALL MR 232 (S.C.) Followed.\t [Para 16]\n\nThere would no waste of time, money and expense if a party, with open eyes, agrees to go to Arbitration of two persons and then participates in the proceedings. On the contrary there would be waste of time, money and energy if such a party is allowed to resile because the Award is not of his liking. Allowing such a party to resile would not be in furtherance of any public policy and would be most inequitable.\t\t [Para 17]\n\nSection 34(2)(a)(v) only applies if \"the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement of the parties\". These opening words make it very clear that if the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure is in accordance with the agreement of the parties, as in this case, then there can be no challenge under this provision. The question of \"unless such agreement was in conflict with the provisions of this Act\" would only arise if the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure is not in accordance with the agreement of the parties. When the composition or the procedure is not in accordance with the agreement of the parties then the parties get a right to challenge the award. But even in such a case the right to challenge the award is restricted. The challenge can only be provided the agreement of the parties is in conflict with a provision of Part I which the parties cannot derogate. In other words, even if the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure is not in accordance with the agreement of the parties but if such composition or procedure is in accordance with the provisions of the said Act. then the party cannot challenge the award. The words \"failing such agreement\" have reference to an agreement providing for the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure. They would come into play only if there is no agreement providing for the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure. If there is no agreement providing for the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure and the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with Part I of the said Act then also a challenge to the award would be available. Thus so long as the composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure are in accordance with the agreement of the parties. Section 34 does not permit challenge to an award merely on the ground that the composition of the arbitral tribunal was in conflict with the provisions of Part I of the said Act. This also indicates that Section 10 is a derogable provision.  [Para 19]"

The proviso in Section 34(3) is very much analogous to Sec.5 of the Limitation Act and in the said discretion of condonation of delay, Section 5 does not put any limitation with regard to the period of the Court's power to condone the delay in the interest of justice.  On the contrary, under Section 34(3) such a discretion has been given to the Court to condone the delay for a sufficient cause, but that discretion cannot be beyond the period of 30 days, which is made explicitly clear by use of the words \"but not thereafter\" in the proviso thereto.  Therefore, I do not find any substance in Mr. Narulla's first contention that Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963 ought to prevail over the proviso to sub-section (3) of Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.

(1908), O.39, Rr.1 & 2.\n\nIn the instant case the contention of the Petitioner before the Court has not been that the invocation of the Bank Guarantee is either fraudulent or that it would result in irretrievable injustice. The contention of the Petitioner is that the letter of invocation dated 11th September 2002 was not in terms of the Bank Guarantee. That being the position, in my view, even if the subsequent letter of invocation dated 25th September 2002 was addressed to the Bank with a view to obviate a contention in regard to the alleged deficiency in the first letter of invocation that was sought to be urged, there was in my view absolutely no prohibition on the First Respondent doing so. Court has already come to the conclusion that there is no merit in the contention that the original letter of invocation dated 11th September 2002 was not in accordance with the terms of the guarantee but, even assuming that there was any defect in the invocation, that would not operate to prevent the First Respondent from addressing an appropriate letter of invocation to the Bank strictly in compliance with the terms of the Bank Guarantee. The Bank Guarantee did not exhaust itself immediately upon the making of a demand thereunder and if the demand is found not to be strictly in accordance with the condition of the Bank Guarantee that does not bring the contract of Guarantee to an end. The reasons for the furnishing of the Bank Guarantee may still continue to subsist and so long as the period of validity of the Bank Guarantee has not expired and the Guarantee continues to remain effective, it would be open to the beneficiary to submit a fresh letter of invocation. Of course, in such a case, the party at whose behest the guarantee has been issued, is entitled to challenge the subsequent invocation and in a given case, the contention may well be that the subsequent invocation is colourable and fraudulent. That is not the case here and in fact, no ground of fraud is urged in the submissions of Counsel. I am of the view that as a matter of principle there was no prohibition on the invocation of the Bank Guarantee by the First Respondent on 25th September 2002 and even if there were to be merit in the contention of the petitioner that the first invocation dated 11th September 2002 was not in accordance with the terms of the Guarantee, that would not prevent the First Respondent from thereafter invoking the Bank Guarantee in terms of the conditions of the Guarantee. The terms of the second letter of invocation are also in accordance with the terms of the guarantee.\n\nIt is not the submission of the Learned Counsel appearing on behalf of the Petitioner that there is any case of fraud or of irretrievable injustice. The underlying disputes between the Petitioner and the Respondent, if any, cannot be a reason to injunct the invocation of the Bank Guarantee. (1999) 8 SCC 436 and AIR 1980 Delhi 174 - Referred to.

Patil,JJ.) :-\n\nAs long as there is nothing in the arbitration agreement to exclude the jurisdiction of the arbitrator to entertain a claim for interest on the amounts due under the contract, or any prohibition to claim interest on the amounts due and become payable under the contract, the jurisdiction of the arbitrator to consider and award interest in respect of all periods subject only to Section 29 of the Arbitration Act, 1940 and that too the powers of the Court thereunder, has to be upheld. The submission that the arbitrator cannot have jurisdiction to award interest for the period prior to the date of his appointment or entering into reference which alone confers him power is too stale and technical to be countenanced in our hands, for the simple reason that in every case the appointment of an arbitrator or even resort to Court to vindicate rights could be only after disputes have cropped up between the parties and continue to subsist unresolved and that if the arbitrator has the power to deal with and decide disputes which cropped up at a point of time and for the period prior to the appointment of an arbitrator, it is beyond comprehension as to why and for what reason and with what justification the arbitrator should be denied only the power to award interest for the pre-reference period when such interest becomes payable and has to be awarded as an accessory or incidental to the sum awarded as due and payable, taking into account the deprivation of the use of such sum to the person lawfully entitled to the same. [Para 47]\n\nFor all the reasons stated above, we answer the reference by holding that the arbitrator appointed with or without the intervention of the Court, has jurisdiction to award interest, on the sums found due and payable, for the pre-reference period, in the absence of any specific stipulation or prohibition in the contract to claim or grant any such interest.\t\t\t [Para 48]\n\nThe decision in Jena's case (1988) I SCC 418 : (AIR 1988 SC 1520) taking a contra view does not lay down the correct position and stands overruled, prospectively, which means that this decision shall not entitle any party nor shall it empower any Court to reopen proceedings which have already become final, and apply only to any pending proceedings.\n\n(1958) 1 SCC 418 overruled.\t [Para 48]\n\nPer Pattanaik, J. (Contra):- The fact that the arbitrator has the power to deal with and decide disputes which cropped up at a point of time, would certainly not clothe the arbitrator with any power, which neither any law confers upon him nor there is any usage of trade having the force of law nor is there any agreement between the parties conferring that power. It is difficult for me to conceive that such power could be conferred upon an arbitrator for the pre-reference period on the supposition that he must be presumed to have the power to grant interest as an accessory or incidental to the sum awarded as due and payable. It is not the question of absence of any specific stipulation in the contract but the correct criteria should be whether there is a positive provision in the contract, conferring the power to the arbitrator to award interest for pre-reference period. I need not discuss any further in view of my concurrence with Brother Mohapatra, J.\t\t\t [Para 2]\n\nPer Mohapatra, J. (Contra) :- In Abhaduta Jenab case this court has emphasised the position that the claim for interest for pre-reference period can be made only if there is a firm basis giving the claimants a cause of action for claim of such interest and in the absence of such basis for such claim an arbitrator is not competent to award interest. The position is well-settled that arbitrator is a creature of agreement, between the parties. He is vested with the power of adjudication of disputes in terms of such agreement. He has to act in accordance with law. Though he discharges the functions of a Court while adjudicating the dispute raised by the parties he cannot be said to be substitute for the Court in all respects. An arbitrator is not bound to follow the strict procedure applicable in a case before the Court. In many cases the arbitrator, though nominated as a Judge by the parties, may not have the requisite experience in the field of law which a presiding officer of a Court possesses. Therefore, it is necessary that in judging the claim of interest for pre-reference period he should ascertain whether such claim is permitted under the terms of the contract between the parties or there is a usage of trade having force of law in support of such claim or there is any other provision of the substantive law enabling the award of such interest\t\t\t\t [Para 20]"

By the very nature of the plea, whether the proceedings before the Arbitrator should be stayed or not cannot be the subject-matter of a final arbitral award.  Therefore, having regard to section 31(6), a decision on such a question cannot be an interim award either.  It must be simply a decision under section 16 of the Act which empowers to rule on its own jurisdiction specifically under section 16 of the Act and that section clearly contemplates such a ruling at an interim stage of the arbitration also.  Only a challenge to it is postponed to a stage after the award is made.   [Para 4]\n\nThough the word \"jurisdiction\" is a verbal cast of many colours as observed by the Supreme Court in M.L.

The policy behind this is to enable the court to find whether the tribunal has exceeded its jurisdiction or has acted without jurisdiction. The language of the Act itself is clear that the Tribunal must state reasons. If the normal meaning is given to the word \"shall\" in Section 31(3) it would be mandatory. It is only in a case where the parties agree that the reasons need not be recorded or when the tribunal has been dispensed from giving reasons that no reasons need be given. In all other cases, reasons must be given. That is because if Section 28 is considered, the tribunal is bound to pass the Award according to substantive law of India and has to bear in mind the terms of the contract. In the instant case, admittedly the Award of the Tribunal does not disclose any reasons. The Tribunal in refusing to give reasons has acted contrary to the provisions of the Act of 1996. In other words, the Award suffers from arbitrariness. When the Tribunal constituted under law is bound to give reasons or to follow the substantive law of India. It can not bypass the said provisions. Hence, the award passed would be contrary to the provisions of the Act and consequently any Award passed would be rendered arbitrary and contrary to public policy of India.

                "description": "Jurisdiction of Tribunal - S.16 provides for competence of Arbitral Tribunal to decide its jurisdiction - Order passed by Arbitrator regarding jurisdiction is subject to judicial scrutiny - Said right is not available to aggrieved party at penultimate stage - Challenge can be made only after final award is made by Arbitrator - If no appeal is provided against such an order, it cannot be said that the provision is ultravires or unconstitutional.\n\nThe Legislature thought it fit to grant right of appeal in certain cases by reserving right in the authority to decide about its own jurisdiction.  Such a provision, cannot be held ultra vires.  As observed by the Supreme court in Chaube Jagdish Prasad & Anr. Vs. Ganga Prasad Chaturvedi,AIR 1959 SC 492, and by a Division Bench of this Court in BASF Styrenics Private Limited Vs. Offshore Industrial Construction Pvt. Ltd. & Anr., (2002)4 Bom CR 661, there are two classes of cases coming before an authority or Tribunal constituted under an Act of Parliament : Firstly, where the Legislature entrusts a Tribunal with a jurisdiction, including jurisdiction to determine whether the preliminary state of facts on which exercise of its jurisdiction depends exists; and secondly, where the Legislature confers jurisdiction on such Tribunals to proceed in a case where a certain state of facts exists or is shown to exist.  The difference between the two lies in that whereas in the former case, the Tribunal has power to determine the facts giving it jurisdiction, in the latter case, it has only to see whether a certain state of facts exists. Keeping in view the phraseology used in Section 16 of the Act, it cannot be gainsaid that the Arbitral Tribunal has been granted jurisdiction to determine whether the preliminary state of facts on which its exercise of jurisdiction depends exists, and it has power to proceed in accordance with law. If no appeal is provided against such an order, it cannot be said that the provision is ultra vires or unconstitutional. Court is also not impressed by an argument that in cases where it has been held by the Arbitral Tribunal that it has no jurisdiction, an appeal is provided, and thus, there is discrimination.  The two classes of aggrieved persons cannot be said to be on par with each other.  As to the persons who are aggrieved by the order passed by the Arbitral Tribunal that it has no jurisdiction, the proceedings would come to an end.  Thereafter it is not open to the Arbitral Tribunal to proceed with the case any more.  The matter would be over.  Obviously, therefore, the Legislature thought it proper to grant a right of appeal.  Regarding other cases, however, the judicial scrutiny of the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal as well as the merits of the matter is merely delayed till the conclusion of the proceedings.  After the final award, it is open to the aggrieved party to raise all contentions, including an objection as to jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal.  Hence, it cannot be successfully contended that the persons similarly situated had been shown different treatment and Section 37(2)(a) of the Act should be held discriminatory and violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.

Section 16 of the Act of 1996 provides that the Arbitral Tribunal shall have jurisdiction to decide on its own jurisdiction and so also rule on any objection with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement.  The Arbitral Tribunal not only has competence to adjudicate on the legality, propriety and validity of its constitution but also to decide any objection that may be raised about existence of enforceable or valid arbitration agreement.  Thus all facets and aspects touching arbitration agreement from its existence, enforceability and validity to constitution of Arbitral Tribunal (legality, propriety and validity thereof) have to be adjudicated by the Arbitral Tribunal once reference is made to it.  In a situation like this where the petitioner has adequate, efficacious and appropriate remedy of raising all contentious issues as aforenoted before Arbitral Tribunal, where invocation of extra ordinary jurisdiction should be permitted.  It is now well settled that powers of the High Court under Article 226 of the Constitution of India are discretionary and the resort to the extra ordinary jurisdiction is not intended as an alternative remedy for relief which may be obtained by the mode provided in the statute.  Where it is open to the aggrieved person to move before the Arbitral Tribunal itself in respect of its constitution or existence or validity of the agreement the machinery provided under section 16 ordinarily does not deserve to be bypassed.  Power of judicial review under Article 226 is Constitutional power available to the superior Court and being discretionary power, no fetters or limits can be placed upon the discretion but the discretion must be exercised along recognized lines lest it may degenerate into caprice and in the light of the process available to the aggrieved party to raise all contentious issues relating to the challenge to the constitution of Arbitral Tribunal and existence and legality of the arbitration agreement before the Arbitral Tribunal, it would not be sound exercise of discretion under Article 226 to entertain the petition challenging the order of the Chief Justice or designated Judge under section 11 of the Act of 1996 whereby the Arbitral Tribunal is constituted.  2003 AIR SCW 3429 and AIR 2000 SC 2821 - Followed.

Constitution of India, Arts.226, 227.\n\nThe Arbitral Tribunal has to decide upon the challenge unless it withdraws or the other party accepts the challenge.  If it negatives the challenge, it has to continue the arbitration proceedings and make an award and such award can then be challenged under section 34.  Same is the position even if challenge to the jurisdiction of Tribunal is rejected.  Thus, the court cannot be approached against interlocutory orders and the Tribunal has to make an award, which can be challenged, under section 34.  [Para 6]\n\nA party to arbitration filed application under section 14(2) contending that on account of \"Bias\" and also on account of the fact that there is no dispute between parties now for adjudication, Arbitrator has become de jure & de facto unable to perform his functions and hence the arbitration proceedings pending before him, should be closed.  It was also alleged that the property in dispute had changed hands.  The arbitrator rejected the application.  His decision could be challenged under S.34 and no interference is called for in writ proceedings.  [Para 2]\n\nIt is clear that remedy under section 14 is not available to petitioner.  Further, act of transfer of property by any of the parties during pendency of arbitration proceedings cannot render the Arbitrator de jure or de facto unable to perform his functions.  Section 14(1)(a) is not applicable in situations where either party to the arbitration takes step in order to defeat the end result of arbitration proceedings.  Such an interpretation will defeat the very purpose of the Act. Disqualification envisaged by this provision is personal to the Arbitrator and emerges because of his own voluntary or involuntary participation in the facts constituting it.  It contemplates a situation in which Arbitrator enters a state that renders him incapable of adjudicating the dispute within the four corners of the law either generally or qua that particular dispute.  His mandate is terminated because the dispute between the parties still survives & requires appointment of another Arbitrator for its resolution.  The case of assignment as pleaded by petitioner can not be a valid ground to invoke section 14(1)(a) as indirectly what is being contended is that the dispute is rendered infructuous by act of one of the parties to it.  Such an act of any party will not create any disqualification in the Arbitrator.\t [Para 7]"

However, in the instant case in view of Article 23.1 read with Art 22.1 of Distributorship agreement it is clear that the parties had agreed that the disputes arising out of the Agreement between them would be finally settled by the arbitration in Seoul, Korea. Not only that, but the rules of arbitration to be made applicable were the Rules of International Chamber of Commerce. This gives the prima facie impression that the seat of arbitration was only in Seoul, South Korea. However, because of the bracketed portion which is to the effect \"or such other place as the parties may agree in writing\", the seat could be elsewhere also. The bracketed portion is meant only for the convenience of the arbitral Tribunal and/or the parties for conducting the proceedings of the arbitration, but the bracketed portion does not, in any manner, change the seat of arbitration, which is only Seoul, Korea. The language is clearly indicative of the express exclusion of Part-I of the Act.   [Para 8,12]\n\nThus, a clear language of Articles 22 and 23 of the Distributorship Agreement between the parties in this case spell out a clear agreement between the parties excluding Part-I of the Act. Since the interpretation of Article 23.1 suggests that the law governing the arbitration will be Korean law and the seat of arbitration will be Seoul in Korea, there will be no question of applicability of Section 11(6) of the Act and the appointment of Arbitrator in terms of that provision.

The decision in S.B.P. & Co. Vs. Patel Engineering Ltd. does not bar such a writ petition. The observations of this Court in SBP that against an order under section 11 of the Act, only an appeal under Article 136 of the Constitution would lie, is with reference to orders made by the Chief Justice of a High Court or by the designate Judge of that High Court. The said observations do not apply to a subordinate court functioning as Designate of the Chief Justice. This Court has repeatedly stressed that Article 136 is not intended to permit direct access to this Court where other equally efficacious remedy is available and the question involved is not of any public importance; and that this Court will not ordinarily exercise its jurisdiction under Article 136, unless the appellant has exhausted all other remedies open to him. Therefore the contention that the order of the Civil Judge, Sr. Division rejecting a petition under section 11 of the Act could only be challenged, by recourse to Article 136 is untenable.

Where the dispute raised by the claimant with regard to validity of the discharge voucher or no-claim certificate or settlement agreement, prima facie, appears to be lacking in credibility, there may not be necessity to refer the dispute for arbitration at all. It cannot be overlooked that the cost of arbitration is quite huge - most of the time, it runs in six and seven figures. It may not be proper to burden a party, who contends that the dispute is not arbitrable on account of discharge of contract, with huge cost of arbitration merely because plea of fraud, coercion, duress or undue influence has been taken by the claimant.

                "description": "Arbitral proceedings - Right to be heard - Right of hearing includes right to be represented by legal practitioner - In arbitration proceedings, parties are entitled to be represented by a legal practitioner, if they so desire unless they have agreed in writing that none of the parties shall be represented by a lawyer.\n\nParties have a right to be heard by the arbitral tribunal.  The right of being heard is specifically conferred on the parties under section 24 of the Act.  It is true that the right of hearing per se may not include and does not necessarily include the right of hearing through a legal practitioner.  In administrative matters, the right of hearing may be restricted to personal hearing by self or through an authorised representative in case of persons with disability, like illiteracy.  It is however, settled position that the arbitral proceedings are not administrative in nature.  They are judicial at least quasi-judicial.  Normally in judicial proceedings, the right of hearing includes the right to be represented by a legal practitioner, though in some case such right is partly restricted.  However, the right to be so represented is required to be specifically excluded by the statute.  Even where the statute excludes or limits the right of hearing through the legal practitioner, Courts have often permitted representation through a legal practitioner.\n\nIn the present case the arbitral tribunal appears to have declined the request of the petitioner to be represented by a legal practitioner on the principal ground that allowing of advocate's presence would result in delay and protraction of the proceedings.  The advocates and lawyers delay the proceedings is myth.  Sooner the myth is exploded the better it is.  May be on stray occasions, a litigant and sometimes even a Judge may feel that a particular proceeding could be disposed of quickly without the assistance of legal practitioners of either side on account of trivility of the dispute otherwise.  But, that is an exception.  By and large, advocates and lawyers assist the Courts and Tribunals in limiting the scope of enquiry to the relevant overlooking the irrelevant, separating grain from the chaff and focussing on the real relevant issues.  Generalisation that advocates and lawyers delay the proceedings is incorrect.  Every Court and Tribunal which is endowed with the duty to act judicially or to determine any issues affecting the rights of the parties in a judicial or quasi judicial enquiry must, in the absence of a statutory provision to the contrary, allow the party before it, if it so wishes to be represented by his authorised representative-including a legal practitioner.  Enforcement of section 30 (which incidently has not yet been brought into force) of the Advocates Act is not necessary for this purpose.  Section 30 of the Advocates Act speaks of the right of Advocates to practise.  But, what about the rights of a litigant, who wants to be represented by a person having knowledge of law.  Duty to act fairly is inherent in every Court, Tribunal and Authority which has a right and duty to decide upon the rights for the citizens.  Giving of a fair opportunity to defend (or to put up his case) to every party is a part of duty to act fairly.  Grant of a permission to a party to be represented by a person of his choice, including a legal practitioner, except where statute prohibits it or the Tribunal feels it to be against the public policy (like in some sensitive matter involving security of the State) is a part of the duty of the Tribunal to act fairly.\n\nIn arbitration proceedings, parties are entitled to be represented by a legal practitioner if they so desire unless they have agreed in writing that none of the parties shall be represented by a lawyer.

The statement of objects and reasons of this enactment makes it abundantly clear that the enactment is comprehensive piece of Legislation covering international arbitration and conciliation as also domestic arbitration and conciliation.  The whole purpose is to make provision for arbitration procedure which is fair, efficient and capable of application in all specific arbitration.  The enactment is aimed at encouraging parties to settle their disputes by taking recourse to Arbitration and Conciliation.  At the same time, it minimises the role, which is supervisory, of the Court in arbitration process.  If the purpose of this enactment is to be achieved, then the interpretation of Section 8 as suggested cannot be accepted.  Advisedly, when the Legislature has covered actions before Civil Court in Section 8(1) then it is not permissible to whittle down or dilute the same.  The term \"Action\" must be and needs to be construed broadly to fulfil the above mentioned legislative intent.  If summary suits are left out of the purview of Section 8(1) then the purpose of enacting a comprehensive Legislation such as Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, cannot be achieved.  Section 8 would cover suits under Order XXXVII of CPC and it is not permissible to leave them out of it's purview. AIR 2000 SC 1886 - Refd.  [Para 10,11]"

Perusal of Section 16 shows that conduct of the Petitioner of participating in the proceedings, depositing arbitration fees will also not amount to waiver, because sub-section 2 of Section 16 enables a party who himself has made appointment of the arbitrator to object to the appointment of the same person as an arbitrator, provided the objection to the jurisdiction is raised not later than the submission of the statement of defence.  In terms of the provisions of the Act, an appointment of the sole arbitrator can be made by an agreement of the parties by one party issuing notice to the other party suggesting the name of the person who it wants to be appointed as an arbitrator and giving other party 30 days time to consider the proposal.  In the present case there is no notice issued by either party which complies with the  requirement of Section 11(5) of the Act.  Issuance of a notice which complies with the requirements of Section 11(5) is a condition precedent for brining about a valid appointment of a sole arbitrator by agreement of the parties.  Therefore, as both notices issued by the Respondent do not comply with the provisions of Section 11(5) of the Act, the appointment of an arbitrator can not be said to be valid.\t [Para 7]\n\nSub-section 5 of Section 11 operates on two things; (i) absence of agreement on procedure for appointment of the arbitrator and (ii) failure of the parties to reach the agreement within 30 days of one party giving notice to the other party.  The scheme of Section 11(5) is that if there is no agreement between the parties in relation to the procedure that is to be followed in the matter of appointment of the arbitrator, then either parties make appointment within 30 days of one party issuing notice by agreement, otherwise the power to make the appointment passes on to the Chief Justice and once the power gets vested in the Chief Justice, parties by conduct or agreement cannot divest the Chief Justice of that power.  In the present case, admittedly, the appointment of the sole arbitrator is not made by the Chief Justice, therefore, the sole arbitrator who made the award had no jurisdiction to make the award.  The award of the learned arbitrator therefore, rejecting the objection to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator, therefore, is liable to be set aside.\t [Para 8]"

The grant of an interim prohibitory injunction or an interim mandatory injunction are governed by well known rules and it is difficult to imagine that the legislature while enacting Section 9 of the Act intended to make a provision which was dehors the accepted principles that governed the grant of an interim injunction. Same is the position regarding the appointment of a receiver since the Section itself brings in, the concept of 'just and convenient' while speaking of passing any interim measure of protection. The concluding words of the Section, \"and the court shall have the same power for making orders as it has for the purpose and in relation to any proceedings before it\" also suggest that the normal rules that govern the court in the grant of interim orders is not sought to be jettisoned by the provision. Moreover, when a party is given a right to approach an ordinary court of the country without providing a special procedure or a special set of rules in that behalf, the ordinary rules followed by that court would govern the exercise of power conferred by the Act. On that basis also, it is not possible to keep out the concept of balance of convenience, prima facie case, irreparable injury and the concept of just and convenient while passing interim measures under Section 9 of the Act.\t\t\t\t\t\t  [Para 10]\n\nWhen the grant of relief by way of injunction is, in general, governed by the Specific Relief Act, and S.9 provides for an approach to the Court for an interim injunction, the relevant provisions of the Specific Relief Act cannot be kept out of consideration.  For, the grant of that interim injunction has necessarily to be based on the principles governing its grant emanating out of the relevant provisions of the Specific Relief Act and the law bearing on the subject.  Under S.28 of the Act of 1996, even the Arbitral Tribunal is enjoined to decide the dispute submitted to it, in accordance with the substantive law for the time being in force in India, if it is not an international commercial arbitration. So, it cannot certainly be inferred that S.9 keeps out the substantive law relating to interim reliefs.  AIR 1999 MP 57 Overruled.\t [Para 14]"

Appellant had filed his claim before the arbitrator.  The Arbitrator held that he had no jurisdiction to proceed with the matter as there existed earlier award passed by the Superintending Engineer, a nominated arbitrator.  Appeal filed was rejected by High Court holding that it had no jurisdiction to hear the appeal as in terms of sub-section (2) of section 37, the appeal lay before the District Court as it does not exercise any original civil jurisdiction.  In appeal Supreme Court held, if the Arbitrator opines that he has no jurisdiction to hear the matter, an appeal lies before the court as defined in S.2(1)(e) of the Act.  The \"court\" means the Principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction in a district and included High Court which exercises the original civil jurisdiction.  If a High Court does not exercise the original civil jurisdiction, it would not be a 'court' within the meaning of the said provision.  An appeal in terms of sub-section (2) of section 377 is a statutory appeal prescribed to a court.  There is no reason as to why having regard to its plain language, the definition of \"court\" shall not be put into service.  It may be true that the interpretation clause provides for \"unless the context otherwise requires\".  If application of the interpretation clause contained in the Act shall lead to anomalous and absurd results, one may not stick to the definition but no such case has been made out.  Section 42 of the 1996 Act refers to applications and not to appeals and the section in the instant case, has no application.  An order passed under 11(6) may be a judicial order but the same does not take away the effect of the appellate jurisdiction to be exercised by a court under sub-section (2) of section 37 of the 1996 Act.  There is a distinction between an appeal and an application.  Whereas S.42 of the Act provides for an application, S.37(2) provides for a statutory appeal.  A forum of an appellate court must be determined with reference to the definition thereof contained in the Act.  Appeal dismissed. \t\t [Para 6,23,24,25,33]"

The reasons given are that the Company has suffered huge losses and cannot be revived.  It is really very difficult to comprehend as to how a Company which has suffered losses worth more than its own worth could offer a bank guarantee.  It is a matter of common knowledge that no bank would stand guarantee for a company which has run into losses and is under shadow of being wound up.  The bank would expect that a company for which the guarantee is to be offered has a business potential and would be in a position to repay, if for any reason the guarantee is required to be encashed.  In such case, the Company will have to deposit atleast 10% of the amount of guarantee in the bank.  Since the production has ceased the company has no source of income at all.  It cannot therefore, have even a capacity to deposit that much amount.  It would not be in a position to offer security to bank without which bank will certainly in turn not offer guarantee.

In the absence of the parties agreeing to the procedure it will be open to the Tribunal to consider the provisions of S.19 and to lay down a procedure for the Tribunal to be followed while deciding the arbitral proceedings.  Therefore, in a case where the petitioner sought for a mandamus or a direction to the Tribunal to follow a particular procedure or to do any act under the extra ordinary jurisdiction of the writ court, it was held that, if the party is aggrieved by the procedure followed and the procedure followed has denied to the party a fair opportunity of participating in the Arbitral proceedings or was unable to present her case the award can be challenged under S.34 of the Act.  There is always a power of procedural review inherent in court and Tribunal to do justice.  1981 Lab.I.C. 155 - Foll.  [Para 5]"

K. Mathur, J. :- An appeal under sub-section (2) of Section 37 only lies \"if their is an order passed under Section 16(2) & (3) of the Act. Section 16(2) & (3) deals with the exercise of jurisdiction. The plea of jurisdiction was not taken by the appellant. It was taken by the respondent in order to meet their counter-claim. But it was not in the context of the fact that the Tribunal had no jurisdiction, it was in the context that this question of counter-claim was no more open to be decided for the simple reason that all the issues which had been raised in counter-claim Nos.1 to 10 had already been settled in the minutes of meeting dated 6th/7th April, 2000 and it was recorded that no other issues to be resolved in 1st and 3rd contracts. Therefore, the question of jurisdiction was not involved in the matter. In fact it was in the context of the fact that the entire counter-claims have already been satisfied and settled in the meeting that it was concluded that no further issues remained to be settled. In this context, the counter-claims filed by the appellant was opposed. If any grievance was there, that should have been by the respondent and not by the appellant. It is only the finding of fact recorded by the Tribunal after considering the counter-claim vis-a-vis the minutes of the meeting dated 6th/7th April, 2000. Therefore, there was no question of jurisdiction involved in the matter so as to enable the appellant to approach the High Court directly.  [Para 6]\n\nPer P. K. Balasubramanyan, J. :- Where a counter-claim is referred to and dealt with and a plea that the counter-claim does not survive in view of the settlement of disputes between the parties earlier arrived at is accepted, it could not be held to be a case of refusal to exercise jurisdiction by the Arbitral Tribunal. Same is the position when an Arbitral Tribunal finds that a claim was dead and was not available to be made at the relevant time or that the claim was not maintainable for other valid reasons or that the claim was barred by limitation. They are all adjudications by the Tribunal on the merits of the claim and in such a case the aggrieved party can have recourse only to Section 34 of the Act and will have to succeed on establishing any of the grounds available under that provision. It would not be open to that party to take up the position that by refusing to go into the merits of his claim, the Arbitral Tribunal had upheld a plea that it does not have jurisdiction to entertain the claim and hence the award or order made by it, comes within the purview of Section 16(2) of the Act and consequently is appealable under Section 37(2)(a) of the Act.\n\nIn the case on hand, what the Tribunal has found is that in view of the M.O.M. wherein the various claims of either party were thrashed out and settled, N.T.P.C. could not pursue most of the claims set out in the counter-claim. This is a finding on the merits of the claim of N.T.P.C. It is not a decision by the Arbitral Tribunal either under Section 16(2) or Section 16(3) of the Act. Consequently, the High Court was right in holding that the appeal filed by N.T.P.C. under Section 37(2)(a) was not maintainable.\t    [Para 14,15]"

                "description": "Expression \"public policy of India\" - Meaning of.\n\nThe expression \"public policy of India\" must include all such fundamental principles as providing a basis for administration of justice and enforcement of law in this country. Without meaning to exhaustively enumerate the purport of the expression \"Fundamental Policy of Indian Law\", we may refer to three distinct and fundamental juristic principles that must necessarily be understood as a part and parcel of the Fundamental Policy of Indian law. The first and foremost is the principle that in every determination whether by a Court or other authority that affects the rights of a citizen or leads to any civil consequences, the Court or authority concerned is bound to adopt what is in legal parlance called a 'judicial approach' in the matter. The duty to adopt a judicial approach arises from the very nature of the power exercised by the Court or the authority does not have to be separately or additionally enjoined upon the fora concerned. The importance of Judicial approach in judicial and quasi judicial determination lies in the fact so long as the Court, Tribunal or the authority exercising powers that affect the rights or obligations of the parties before them shows fidelity to judicial approach, they cannot act in an arbitrary, capricious or whimsical manner. Judicial approach ensures that the authority acts bonafide and deals with the subject in a fair, reasonable and objective manner and that its decision is not actuated by any extraneous consideration. Judicial approach in that sense acts as a check against flaws and faults that can render the decision of a Court, Tribunal or Authority vulnerable to challenge.\n\nEqually important and indeed fundamental to the policy of Indian law is the principle that a Court and so also a quasi-judicial authority must, while determining the rights and obligations of parties before it, do so in accordance with the principles of natural justice. Besides the celebrated 'audi alteram partem' rule one of the facets of the principles of natural justice is that the Court/authority deciding the matter must apply its mind to the attendant facts and circumstances while taking a view one way or the other. Non-application of mind is a defect that is fatal to any adjudication. Application of mind is best demonstrated by disclosure of the mind and disclosure of mind is best done by recording reasons in support of the decision which the Court or authority is taking. The requirement that an adjudicatory authority must apply its mind is, in that view, so deeply embedded in our jurisprudence that it can be described as a fundamental policy of Indian Law.\n\nNo less important is the principle now recognised as a salutary juristic fundamental in administrative law that a decision which is perverse or so irrational that no reasonable person would have arrived at the same will not be sustained in a Court of law. Perversity or irrationality of decisions is tested on the touchstone of Wednesbury's principle of reasonableness. Decisions that fall short of the standards of reasonableness are open to challenge in a Court of law often in writ jurisdiction of the Superior courts but no less in statutory processes where ever the same are available.

Held expression \"at any time\" expresses a time when an event takes place expressing a particular state or condition that is when the dispute or difference arises.

It is true that in the arbitration agreement there is no specific provision authorizing the Managing Director to appoint a substitute arbitrator if the original appointment terminates or if the originally appointed arbitrator withdraws from the arbitration. But, this so called omission in the arbitration agreement is made up by the specific provision contained in Section 15(2) of the Act. The withdrawal of an arbitrator from the office for any reason is within the purview of Section 15(1)(a) of the Act. Obviously, therefore Section 15(2) would be attracted and a substitute arbitrator has to be appointed according to the rules that are applicable for the appointment of the arbitrator to be replaced. Therefore, what Section 15(2) contemplates is an appointment of the substituted arbitrator or the replacing of the arbitrator by another according to the rules that were applicable to the appointment of the original arbitrator who was being replaced. The term \"rules\" in Section 15(2) obviously referred to the provision for appointment, contained in the arbitration agreement or any Rules of any Institution under which the disputes were referred to arbitration. There was no failure on the part of the concerned party as per the arbitration agreement, to fulfil his obligation in terms of Section 11 of the Act so as to attract the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice under Section 11(6) of the Act for appointing a substitute arbitrator. Obviously, Section 11(6) of the Act has application only when a party or the concerned person had failed to act in terms of the arbitration agreement. When Section 15(2) says that a substitute arbitrator can be appointed according to the rules that were applicable for the appointment of the arbitrator originally, it is not confined to an appointment under any statutory rule or rule framed under the Act or under the Scheme. It only means that the appointment of the substitute arbitrator must be done according to the original agreement or provision applicable to the appointment of the arbitrator at the initial stage.\t [Para 4]"

There is a fundamental difference between a domestic award under Part-I and a foreign award under Part-II. Under section 2(7), an award made under Part-I of the Act is considered as a domestic award. \n\nA domestic award is enforceable under the Code of Civil Procedure as if it were a decree of the Court, without anything more subject to the time for making an application to set aside the award having expired or such application, if made, having been refused. In other words, it is not necessary for a party seeking enforcement of the award to obtain any further orders from the Court before enforcing the same.\n\nHowever, a party must apply for the enforcement of a foreign award. The other party is entitled to oppose the application for enforcement of the foreign award on the grounds mentioned therein. The Court is entitled to refuse the enforcement of a foreign award on the grounds mentioned in section 48. The doubt, if any, in this regard is set at rest by section 49 which provides that it is only where the Court is satisfied that the foreign award is enforceable under Chapter I of Part-II that the award shall be enforceable as a decree of that Court. Thus, a foreign award is not enforceable as a decree till the Court, in an application for the enforcement of the foreign award, holds that it is enforceable under Chapter I of Part-II of the Act.\n\nSection 48 negates the contention that a foreign award is enforceable merely because it has become final between the parties. Section 48(e) read with the other provisions in section 48 and also read with section 49 draws a distinction between an award becoming binding between the parties under the law of which that award was made and the enforceability of the award in India. Even if a foreign award has become binding between the parties under the law of which that award was made, it does not follow that the award is enforceable in India. The power of the Court to refuse enforcement of a foreign award under sections 47 and 48 is not annulled merely because an award has become final between the parties. The term \"or\" before each of the clauses (b) to (e) of sub-section (1) of section 48 indicates that the Court may refuse enforcement of a foreign award on any of the grounds mentioned in clauses (a) to (e) of section 48(1). The power of the Court under section 48(1)(e) to refuse enforcement of a foreign award which has not become final is only one such independent ground. It is axiomatic, therefore, that the Court may refuse enforcement of a foreign award even if it has become binding on the parties under the law of which that award was made, on the grounds mentioned in clauses (a) to (d).\n\nThis view is fortified by sub-section (2) of section 48. The word \"also\" therein makes it clear that the enforcement of a foreign award may be refused on the grounds mentioned in section 48(2) even if the grounds under section 48(1) are not established by the party against whom the award was made.\n2002(3) Bom C.R. 554 Rel. on.

In this case, the learned Arbitrator took note of the fact that the escalation was payable and in fact admittedly paid.  Moreover, the contractor had to spend on the purchase of cement bags from the open market since the appellant failed to supply the said bags.  It is having regard to this circumstance, that the Arbitrator awarded interest at the rate of 12% p.a. on those items.  The rate of interest cannot be said to be awarded arbitrarily.  Moreover, the period for which the interest is awarded is also rational.  The interest is awarded for the period, after the building was ready, and in normal course, the contractor would have been entitled to receive payment, had the appellants prepared the final bill.  The other terminus of the period is the date of realisation.  It is difficult to find anything wrong with the award of interest at the rate of 12% in these circumstances.  Further the interest awarded on the other sum that is compensatory claim, appears to be reasonable also.  2005(5) ALL MR (S.C.) 515 and 2005(5) ALL MR (S.C.) 606 - Ref. to.\t  [Para 8]"

When an award is induced or affected by fraud or corruption, the same will fall within the aforesaid grounds of excess of jurisdiction and a lack of due process. Therefore, if we may say so, the explanation to Section 34 of ABC is like 'a stable man in the saddle' on the unruly horse of public policy.  \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 46]\n\nThe expression 'fraud in the making of the award' cannot be narrowly construed. Court cannot do so primarily because fraud being of 'infinite variety' may take many forms, and secondly, the expression 'the making of the award' will have to be read in conjunction with whether the award 'was induced or affected by fraud'. On such conjoint reading, Court is unable to accept the contention that facts which surfaced subsequent to the making of the award, but have a nexus with the facts constituting the award, are not relevant to demonstrate that there has been fraud in the making of the award. Concealment of relevant and material facts, which should have been disclosed before the arbitrator, is an act of fraud. Concealed facts in the very nature of things surface subsequently. Such a construction would defeat the principle of due process and would be opposed to the concept of public policy incorporated in the explanation.   [Para 51,52]\n\nThe facts concealed must have a causative link. And if the concealed facts, disclosed after the passing of the award, have a causative link with the facts constituting or inducing the award, such facts are relevant in a setting aside proceeding and award may be set aside as affected or induced by fraud.

The terms of this turnkey contract were reduced into writing by the \"wrap-around agreement\" of 10-5-2000.  Under the \"wrap-around agreement\", the Appellant had the right to encash any or all of the guarantees for any breach in any of the terms of the four contracts.  An appraisal of the terms of the contract leads to the conclusion that the bank guarantees were intended for both purposes : for securing the advances paid to the First Respondent and also for securing due performance of the contract.  It is no function of the Second Respondent-Bank, nor of the Court, to enquire as to whether due performance had actually happened when, under the terms of the guarantee, the Second Respondent-Bank was obliged to make payment irrespective of any contractual dispute.  Bank must pay according to the tenor of its guarantee, on demand, without proof or condition.  There are, however, two exceptions to this rule.  The first is when there is a clear fraud of which the bank has notice and a fraud of the beneficiary from which it seeks to benefit.  The fraud must be of an egregious nature as to vitiate the entire underlying transaction.  The second exception to the general rule of non-intervention is when there are \"special equities\" in favour of injunction, such as when \"irretrievable injury\" or \"irretrievable injustice\" would occur if such an injunction were not granted.  The First Respondent has not brought the case under any of these exceptions.  The general rule and its exceptions have been reiterated in so many judgments that in U. P. State Sugar Corporation Vs. Sumac International Ltd. the Supreme Court correctly declared that the law was \"settled\".  Whatever may be the law, as to the encashment of bank guarantees in other jurisdictions, when the law in India is clear, settled and without any deviation whatsoever, there is no occasion to rely upon foreign case law.

                "description": "Appointment of arbitrator - Agreement between parties not containing provision for appointment of substitute arbitrator - Hence, appointment of third Arbitrator and refusal of arbitrator appointed by one party to arbitrate in the matter, was invalid.\n\nIn the instant case Clause 19 of piece work agreement, provides for appointment of two arbitrators, one by each party, with liberty to the arbitrators to appoint an Umpire, in case of difference or their failure to reach an agreement within one month of their appointment. The award made by two arbitrators or Umpire, as the case may be, is treated as final, conclusive and binding on the parties. This clause also specifies the consequence of failure of either party to the difference or dispute to appoint an arbitrator within 30 calendar days counted from the date of notice in writing given by the other side or refusal of the arbitrator appointed by either party to accept such appointment or act upon the same. In that event, the arbitrator appointed by the other party becomes entitled to proceed with the reference as the Sole Arbitrator and make an award. There is nothing in Clause 19 from which it can be inferred that in the event of refusal of an arbitrator to accept the appointment or arbitrate in the matter, the party appointing such arbitrator has an implicit right to appoint a substitute arbitrator. Section 15(2) of the Act does not per se apply to a case where an arbitrator appointed by a party to the agreement declines to accept the appointment or refuses to arbitrate in the matter. Of course in a given case, refusal to act on the arbitrator's part can be inferred after he has entered upon arbitration by giving consent to the nomination made by either party to the agreement. [Para 20,23]\n\nInsofar as this case is concerned, that the arbitrator appointed by respondent No.1, declined to accept the appointment/arbitrate in the matter on the ground that in his capacity as Superintending Engineer and Chief Engineer, he was associated with Koyna Hydel Project implying thereby that he may not be able to objectively examine the claims of the parties or the other party may question his impartiality. To put it differently, the appointed arbitrator did not enter upon the arbitration. Therefore, there was no question of his withdrawing from the office of arbitrator so as to enable respondent No.1 to appoint a substitute arbitrator. In any case, in the absence of a clear stipulation to that effect in the agreements, respondent No.1 could not have appointed a substitute arbitrator and the designated Judge gravely erred in appointing the third arbitrator by presuming that the appointment of said arbitrator was in accordance with law.   [Para 24,26,27]\n\nAlso, designated Judge appointed the third arbitrator because he was of the view that in terms of Section 15(2), a substitute arbitrator could be appointed where the mandate of an already appointed arbitrator terminates. In taking that view, the designated Judge failed to notice that Section 15(1) provides for termination of the mandate of arbitrator where he withdraws from office for any reason or by or pursuant to agreement of the parties and not where the arbitrator appointed by either party declines to accept the appointment or refuses to act as such and that the term 'rules' appearing in Section 15(2) takes within its fold not only the statutory rules, but also the terms of agreement entered into between the parties.

Such a suit filed by the landlord against the tenant for recovery of possession, therefore, cannot be referred under Section 8 of the 1996 Act to arbitration. In fact, subsection (3) of Section 2 of the 1996 Act expressly provides that Part-I which relates to 'arbitration' where the place of arbitration is in India shall not affect any other law for the time being in force by virtue of which certain disputes may not be submitted to arbitration. Section 6 of the Tenancy Act is one such law which clearly bars arbitration in a dispute relating to recovery of possession of premises by the landlord from the tenant. Since the suit filed by the appellants was for eviction, it was a suit for recovery of possession and could not be referred to arbitration because of a statutory provision in Section 6 of the Tenancy Act. \n\n(1981) 1 SCC 523 Rel.on.

The Chief Engineer or the Designated Officer is not an independent authority or person, who has no connection or control over the work. As a matter of fact, he is having over all supervision and charge of the execution of the work. He is not required to hear the parties or to take evidence, oral or documentary. He is not invested with the power to adjudicate upon the rights of the parties to the dispute or difference and his decision is subject to the right of the aggrieved party to seek relief in a Court of Law. The decision of the Chief Engineer or the Designated Officer is treated as binding on the contractor subject to his right to avail remedy before an appropriate Court. The use of the expression 'in the first place' unmistakably shows that non-adjudicatory decision of the Chief Engineer is subject to the right of the aggrieved party to seek remedy. Therefore, Clause 29 which is subject matter of consideration in most of the appeals and similar clauses cannot be treated as an Arbitration Clause.\n\n(1980) 2 SCC 341, (1996) 2 SCC 216, (1999) 2 SCC 166, 1998(2) ALL MR 667 (S.C.)

Such arbitration proceedings are governed by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for short, the Arbitration Act).\n\nUnder the Arbitration Act as well as, the MSCS Act there is no provision, whereby the Arbitrator can issue such directions against any employer with regard to the dues of the employees (the Petitioner); there is also no provision whereby, the Arbitrator is permitted to direct to recover the debt as arrears of land revenue from the employer personally in case of default of the employees, except following the due procedure of enforcement of the award. This is totally beyond the jurisdiction and is impermissible. The appointment of Receiver in such fashion, at this stage, and such directions while passing the award under Order XL, Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure (for short, CPC) is also impermissible. The Manager of Recovery Department of the bank cannot be directed to recover the amount or execute the award in such fashion.\n\n The Arbitration Act and all the applicable provisions are applicable under Section 84(3) of MSCS Act. The Arbitration Act provides special provisions for execution of the award. The Award can be enforced only when the award attains finality as per Section 34 read with 37 of the Arbitration Act and not otherwise. In view of clear provisions, there is no question of appointment of Receiver at this stage, in such fashion to enforce the award and/or to sale the properties, as done in the present case. It is impermissible under both the Acts.\n\nThe power of attachment as contemplated under Section 96 of the MSCS Act cannot be equated with the power of Receiver under Order XL Rule 1 of the CPC to implement the award as done in the present case. However, as per clause 5, there is a power to attach the property pending the reference under Section 84 of the MSCS Act, if the Arbitrator found that pending the arbitration the party/disputant with intent to defeat or delay the execution of any decision and/or there is a material to show that he is likely to remove the whole or any part of the property from its existing precincts, the Arbitrator can ask for adequate security and/or direct conditional attachment but not once the award is passed. Section 96(2) of the MSCS Act only provides that the attachment order shall be executed by a Civil Court having jurisdiction. Therefore, the order passed by the Arbitrator directing the Manager of DisputantBank to attach the hypothecated Stocks and Books Debts and LIC Polices and other personal properties and further to sell the same in public auction and adjust the sale proceeds of the same towards the awarded amount, is illegal and without jurisdiction.\n\nIn absence of any specific provisions, even under the MSCS Act, the Arbitrator is not empower to pass the order as done in the present case i.e. clauses 3, 4, 5 as reproduced in para 2. It is beyond jurisdiction. It is necessary to note that once the Arbitration Act is made applicable and the parties appeared before the Arbitrator, they are bound and governed by the provisions of Arbitration Act and not by MSCS Act for execution of the award. It is settled that the intention and object of the MSCS Act needs to be respected. In this regard, there is no conflict against the award so passed under Section 84 of the MSCS Act. There is no specific Appeal and/or Review available for the disputants under the MSCS Act. However, the aggrieved party has remedy under the Arbitration Act as contemplated under Sections 34 and 37 of the Arbitration Act. The enforcement provisions as available is only after the award attains finality under the Arbitration Act.\n2010 (1) B.C.R.908 - Ref.    [Para 3,4,6,8]"

It does not make the decision of the Superintending Engineer final on any dispute, other than the claim for increase in rates for non-tendered items. It operates in a limited sphere, that is, where in regard to a non-tendered additional work executed by the contractor, if the contractor is not satisfied with the unilateral determination of the rate therefor by the Engineer-in-Charge the rate for such work will be finally determined by the Superintending Engineer. It is a provision made with the intention to avoid future disputes regarding rates for non-tendered item. It is not a provision for reference of future disputes or settlement of future disputes. The decision of superintending Engineer is not a judicial determination, but decision of one party which is open to challenge by the other party in a court of law. The said clause can by no stretch of imagination be considered to be an arbitration agreement. 2003 (7) SCC418 Rel.on.   [Para 15]"

(1908), S.20 - Jurisdiction clause in arbitration agreement - Words such as \"done\", \"only\", \"exclusive\" or \"exclusive jurisdiction\" are not decisive - Clause in a agreement providing that courts at Kolkata shall have jurisdiction - It excludes all other courts.\n\nIn this case clause in the agreement provides that the agreement shall be subject to jurisdiction of the courts at Kolkata. It is a fact that whilst providing for jurisdiction clause in the agreement the words like 'alone', 'only', 'exclusive' or 'exclusive jurisdiction' have not been used but this, is not decisive and does not make any material difference. The intention of the parties - by having such a clause in the agreement - is clear and unambiguous that the courts at Kolkata shall have jurisdiction which means that the courts at Kolkata alone shall have jurisdiction. It is so because for construction of jurisdiction clause, the maxim expressio unius est exclusio alterius comes into play as there is nothing to indicate to the contrary. This legal maxim means that expression of one is the exclusion of another. By making a provision that the agreement is subject to the jurisdiction of the courts at Kolkata, the parties have impliedly excluded the jurisdiction of other courts. Where the contract specifies the jurisdiction of the courts at a particular place and such courts have jurisdiction to deal with the matter, an inference may be drawn that parties intended to exclude all other courts. A clause like this is not hit by Section 23 of the Contract Act at all. Such clause is neither forbidden by law nor it is against the public policy. It does not offend Section 28 of the Contract Act in any manner.\n\n(1971) 1 SCC 286, (1989) 2 SCC 163, (1993) 2 SCC 130, (1995) 4 SCC 153, (2002) 9 SCC 613, 2004(5) ALL MR 534 (S.C.), 2009 ALL SCR 2604 Rel. on. \t     [Para 31,38,62]"

The claimant / Respondent No.1 herein has made serious allegations in respect of maintenance of accounts by the managing partners. The arbitral tribunal consists of two Chartered Accountants. All the three members of the arbitral tribunal have unanimously decided to appoint an independent auditor for the purposes of verification of the accounts of the firm. The tribunal is expected to acquaint themselves with all the details in respect of functioning of the firm including financial statements and other necessary details. In order to elicit information and collect data with a view to pass final award in the matter, the tribunal is justified in making appointment of an independent auditor. The order passed by the Tribunal directing appointment of an independent arbitrator is a step-in-aid in determining the issues raised before the Tribunal. In order to effectively and correctly decide issues raised by the parties before the Tribunal, it is necessary for the Tribunal to get acquainted with all true and correct facts in respect of financial matters of the firm. The tribunal, which consists of two Chartered Accountants, in order to acquaint themselves with the true and correct facts and with a view to verify the statements placed on record by the appellants herein, have deemed it appropriate to take help of an expert i.e. an independent auditor. The directions, as issued by the Tribunal, therefore, can be construed to be a step-in-aid for determining the issues pending before the tribunal and the tribunal is within its bound in issuing such directions, which are contemplated by Section 26 of the Act.\n\nAIR 2004 SC 1344 - Ref. to.

Hence, when are of her partners had made serious allegations against the respondents other partners alleging them to commit malpractices in the account books and manipulate the finances of the partnership firm, which, cannot be properly dealt with by the Arbitrator. As such, the High Court was justified in dismissing the petition to refer the matter to an Arbitrator. Thus, when the case relates to allegations of fraud and serious malpractices on the part of the respondents, such a situation can only be settled in court through furtherance of detailed evidence by either parties and such a situation can not be properly gone into by the Arbitrator.

The plain meaning of the aforesaid clause would tend to show that even on the termination of the agreement/contract, the arbitration agreement would still survive. Section 16(1)(a) presumes the existence of a valid arbitration clause and mandates the same to be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. By virtue of Section 16(1)(b), it continues to be enforceable notwithstanding a declaration of the contract being null and void. In view of the provisions contained in Section 16(1) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, it would not be possible to accept the submission that with the termination of the MOU on 31st December, 2007, the arbitration clause would also cease to exist. The disputes that have arisen between the parties clearly relate to the subject matter of the relationship between the parties which came into existence through the MOU. Clearly, therefore, the disputes raised by the petitioner needs to be referred to arbitration. Under the arbitration clause, a reference was to be made that the disputes were to be referred to a single arbitrator. Since the parties have failed to appoint an arbitrator under the agreed procedure, it is necessary for Court to appoint the Arbitrator.\n\n(2008) 16 SCC 774 Rel. on.  [Para 33,34]"

The said provision has to be read in conjunction with Section 5 of the Commercial Courts Act.\n\nThe aforesaid provision clearly lays down that a forum is created, i.e., Commercial Appellate Division. Section 50(1)(b) of the 1996 Act provides for an appeal. Section 50(1)(b) has not been amended by the Act that has come into force on 23.10.2015. Thus, an appeal under Section 50(1)(b) of the 1996 Act before the Division Bench is maintainable.\n\nIn the instant case impugned judgment of the learned Single Judge under Section 50(1)(b) of the 1996 Act is passed in the original side of the High Court. Be that as it may, under Section 13 of the Act, the single Judge has taken the decision. Section 13 bars an appeal under Letters Patent unless an appeal is provided under the 1996 Act. Such an appeal is provided under Section 5 of the Act. The Letters Patent Appeal could not have been invoked if Section 50 of the 1996 Act would not have provided for an appeal. But it does provide for an appeal. A conspectus reading of Sections 5 and 13 of the Act and Section 50 of the 1996 Act which has remained unamended leads to the irresistible conclusion that a Letters Patent Appeal is maintainable before the Division Bench. It has to be treated as an appeal under Section 50(1)(b) of the 1996 Act and has to be adjudicated within the said parameters.  \t [Para 12,13,22,23,24]"

                "description": "Court - Place of arbitration - Dispute relating to construction of Mumbra byepass in Thane District - Both High Court on Original Side and District Court at Thane having jurisdiction in respect of subject matter - Appellant State initiating proceedings in District Court, Thane and on the same day respondent company initiated proceedings before Ordinary Original Civil Side of the High Court - Held, choice under the Act has to be exercised in favour of the High Court of Bombay.\n\nUnder the scheme of the provisions of the Arbitration Act, if the choice is between the High Court (in exercise of its \"ordinary original civil jurisdiction\") on the one hand, and the \"principal civil court of original jurisdiction\" in the District i.e. the District Judge on the other; Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act has made the choice in favour of the High Court. This in fact impliedly discloses a legislative intent. It makes no difference, if the \"principal civil court of original jurisdiction\", is in the same district over which the High Court exercises original jurisdiction, or some other district. In case an option is to be exercised between a High Court (under its \"ordinary original civil jurisdiction\") on the one hand, and a District Court (as \"principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction\") on the other, the choice under the Arbitration Act has to be exercised in favour of the High Court.    [Para 25]\n\nUnder the Arbitration Act, the legislature has clearly expressed a legislative intent, different from the one expressed in Section 15 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The respondent had chosen to initiate proceedings within the area of Greater Mumbai, it could have done so only before the High Court of Bombay. There was no other court within the jurisdiction of Greater Mumbai, where the respondent could have raised their challenge. Consequently, the respondent by initiating proceedings under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, before the original side of the High Court of Bombay, had not violated the mandate of Section 2(1)(e) of the Arbitration Act.     [Para 18]\n\nThe controversy between the parties does not pertain to recovery of immovable property, partition of immoveable property, foreclosure sale or redemption of immoveable property, determination of any other right to immovable property, for determination of compensation for wrong to immoveable property and/or for the recovery of moveable property under distraint or attachment. It is only in the aforesaid exigencies that Section 16 of the Code of Civil Procedure could have been invoked. The construction of the Mumbra byepass, would only entitle Atlanta Limited to payments contemplated under the contract , and no more. A brief description of the reliefs sought by the rival parties, in the separate proceedings initiated by them, does not indicate that either of the parties were claiming any right to or interest in any immovable property. Since none of the above exigencies contemplated in Section 16 prevail in the dispute between the rival parties, reliance on Section 16 of the Code of Civil Procedure is clearly misplaced.     [Para 19]\n\nThe answer to the jurisdictional question, arising out in the facts and circumstances the instant case, will  not emerge from Section 42 of the Arbitration Act. All the same it is imperative to give effect to the legislative intent recorded under Section 42 aforementioned, namely, that all disputes arising out of a common arbitration agreement, arbitral proceeding or arbitral award, would lie only before one court.

Section 11 (4) would come into play only if the two arbitrators \"fail to agree\" on the third arbitrator within 30 days from the date of their appointment. The expression \"fail to agree\" indicates a disagreement between the arbitrators on the name of the third arbitrator. There can be a failure to agree between the two arbitrators about the appointment of a third arbitrator only if and when the third arbitrator is named/identified by one of the arbitrators. In the absence thereof, there is nothing for them to agree to conversely nothing for them to fail to agree about. In the present case neither of the arbitrators proposed the name of a third arbitrator. The question of the said arbitrators having failed to agree on the appointment of the third arbitrator therefore does not arise. \n\nThe Legislature was obviously conscious of the same and has used these expressions deliberately not only in different sections of the said Act but in section 11 itself in different circumstances. The clearest and most important indication of this is that these expressions have been used in subsection (4) itself. \n\nSub-section (4) (a) pertains to a case where a party \"fails to appoint\" an arbitrator within thirty days whereas clause (b) pertains to a case where the two appointed arbitrators \"fail to agree\" on the third arbitrator within thirty days. If the Legislature intended withdrawing the power of the two appointed arbitrators to appoint the third arbitrator in the event of their having failed to appoint him within thirty days it would have so provided. In other words in that event instead of the words \"fail to agree on\" in section 11 (4) (b) would have been the words \"fail to appoint\".\n\n2007 ALL SCR 1766 - Ref.      [Para 11,12]"

Sub-section (8) does not provide that even if parties have failed to abide by the agreement prescribing the procedure for appointment of an Arbitrator, yet the Chief Justice or the person designated by him should appoint the Arbitrator as per the agreed procedure. At the same time, Chief Justice or the person designated by him is required to bear in mind the qualifications of the arbitrator as required under the arbitration agreement as required under the arbitration agreement and also to secure independent and impartial arbitrator who can do justice between the parties.

The crucial words in Section 4 of the 1963 Act are 'prescribed period'. What is the meaning of these words? Section 2(j) of the 1963 Act defines 'period of limitation' which means the period of limitation prescribed for any suit, appeal or application by the Schedule, and 'prescribed period' means the period of limitation computed in accordance with the provisions of this Act. Section 2(j) of the 1963 Act when read in the context of Section 34(3) of the 1996 Act, it becomes amply clear that the prescribed period for making an application for setting aside arbitral award is three months. The period of 30 days mentioned in proviso that follows sub-section (3) of Section 34 of the 1996 Act is not the 'period of limitation' and, therefore, not 'prescribed period' for the purposes of making the application for setting aside the arbitral award.

It is a common sight that the officers who are awfully busy in their other routine functions, because of their status and position, are made arbitrators. For them, discharge of their other duties assumes more importance (and naturally so) and their role as the arbitrators takes a back seat. This kind of behaviour showing casual approach in arbitration cases is anathema to the very genesis of arbitration. Therefore, where the Government assumes the authority and power to itself, in one sided arbitration clause, to appoint the arbitrators in the case of disputes, it should be more vigilant and more responsible in choosing the arbitrators who are in a position to conduct the arbitral proceedings in an efficient manner, without compromising with their other duties. Time has come when the appointing authorities have to take call on such aspects failing which (as in the instant case), Courts are not powerless to remedy such situations by springing into action and exercising their powers as contained in Section 11 of the Act to constitute an Arbitral Tribunal, so that interest of the other side is equally protected. \t\t\t\t\t    [Para 22]"

If the bank guarantee is unconditional and irrevocable the exceptions in the bank not honouring its obligations under the bank guarantee are firstly a fraud of which the bank has a clear notice. Such a fraud must be of an egregious nature so as to vitiate in its entirety the underlying transaction. The nature of the fraud should be such that the beneficiary of the bank guarantee is seeking to be benefited from such fraud. The second exception are the 'special equities' such as an irretrievable injury or irretrievable injustice which would be caused to the party at whose instance the bank guarantee is issued and if an injunction at the relevant time is not granted the party can never be compensated for such an injury.\t [Para 11]\n\nIt is not in dispute that the defects are noticed by the respondent no.1 and that the bank guarantee postulates its invocation if such defects are noticed by the respondent no.1.

However, it is the duty of the Court to construe correspondence with a view to arrive at the conclusion whether there was any meeting of mind between the parties which could create a binding contract between them. It is necessary for the Court to find out from the correspondence as to whether the parties were ad idem to the terms of contract. While construing an arbitration agreement or arbitration clause, the Courts have to adopt a pragmatic and not technical approach.\n\nAn arbitration agreement even though in writing need not be signed by the parties if the record of agreement is provided by exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or other means of telecommunication. Section 7(4)(c) provides there can be an arbitration agreement in the exchange of statements of claims and defence in which the existence of the agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by the other. If it can be prima facie shown that the parties are at ad idem, then mere fact of one party not signing the agreement cannot absolve himself from the liability under the agreement. In the present day of E-commerce, in cases of internet purchases, tele purchases, ticket booking on internet and in standard forms of contract, terms and conditions are agreed upon. In such agreements, if the identity of the parties is established, and there is a record of agreement it becomes an arbitration agreement if there is an arbitration clause showing ad idem between the parties. Therefore, signature is not a formal requirement under Section 7(4)(b) or 7(4)(c) or under 7(5) of the Act. \n\nA commercial document having arbitration clause has to be interpreted in such a manner as to give effect to agreement rather than invalidate it.

Application u/S.9 was filed by the petitioner before the Bombay HC only on the basis of respondent's bank account lying there. Fact remains that the office and other assets of respondent were situated only in Hyderabad i.e. within jurisdiction of the Andhra Pradesh High Court. Jurisdiction of the Bombay HC to entertain said application u/S.9 was challenged by respondent on ground that \"court\" u/S.9 would mean a \"court\" as defined u/S.2(1)(e)(ii) of the Act. Meaning, application u/S.9 has to be filed only before that High Court which has jurisdiction to decide the subject matter of Arbitration. Thus a contention was raised that it is only the Andhra Pradesh High Court and not the Bombay HC which can entertain application u/S.9 of the Act.\n\n\tRejecting said contention and looking to the object of the 2015 Amendment which allowed invocation of S.9 even in case of international arbitration and also in view of the opening words of S.2 which permit contextual interpretation, held, S.9 would not contemplate \"court\" as defined in S.2(1)(e) of the Act. Rather, in the context of international arbitration, S.9 would refer to a \"court\" as defined under Explanation to S.47 of the Act. Hence, even if the Bombay HC has no jurisdiction to decide subject matter, it can very well provide interim protection u/S.9 in respect of assets/money of respondent lying within its jurisdiction.\n\n2012 ALL SCR 2831, (2012) 2 Mh.L.J. 242, 2012(2) ALL MR 790, 2017 SCC Online Bom 631, 1995 Supp(2) SCC 280, (1998) 8 SCC 1, (2009)16 SCC 659 Ref. to.

In legal profession it very often happens that on a given day a law firm will brief counsel for one client and on the very next day, or perhaps later that very day, will brief another counsel against the first. At no point in their regular practice do counsels appear 'for' the law firm that briefs them, leaving aside cases where the briefing lawyer or law firm is itself the litigant. In house counsel or counsel who receives a fee-paid general retainer or salary from a law firm stands on a different footing. Independent counsel, those in profession who in course of their daily practice receive briefs from many attorneys, law firms or individual practitioners. This is a remnant of the 'dual system', now abolished, and a central feature of that system, one that continues to this day in practice, is the independence of counsel. They accept briefs from multiple attorneys (often on the same day at the same time in different courts). They are not always briefed at every stage of the case, nor is there any rule that they perform the same functions at every stage: a counsel may lead at one stage, and at another may take second chair to a senior. None of this is backed by statute, but hinges on traditions of long standing. This independence manifests itself in different ways. Counsel withdraws sometimes in court itself - because their clients give them fresh instructions contrary to previous ones conveyed to court. In Mumbai at least, counsel from the same chambers often oppose each other in court and there is never a doubt raised about their professional independence. In this city an acceptance of a junior counsel being briefed against the senior whose chamber he or she has joined. No one sees this as anything but the fiercest independence; indeed, seniors consider it a badge of honour to be opposed (the more vigorously the better) by their own juniors, for there is perhaps no better indicator of briefing attorney's confidence in the capability, integrity and independence of a junior counsel than to field him against his own senior.\n\n\tIndependence, therefore, as used in the statute means nothing more than deciding for oneself. Impartiality is lack of bias: the ability to decide without tilting to one side on considerations other than the merits of the case. Arbitral independence and impartiality is precisely this: to decide 'without fear or favour, affection or ill-will', words familiar to us all.\n\n\tTherefore, counsel having accepted a brief from a particular attorney, advocate-on-record or lawyer for some other client is not per se a disqualification or ineligibility. The disqualification connection must be between the arbitrator-counsel and the litigant. That this is of the essence is obvious from Item 3 of the two schedules - in a given case, where the law firm or lawyer is itself or himself the client, the arbitrator cannot function as such in an arbitration where that very law firm or lawyer is also engaged, though for some other party; for the arbitrator in question would then have before him a party for whom he is engaged. \t\t\t\t [Para 26,28,30]"

For this purpose the Conciliator is vested with wide powers to decide the procedure to be followed by him untrammeled by the procedural laws like the Code of Civil Procedure or the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. When the parties are able to resolve the dispute between them by mutual agreement and it appears to the Conciliator that there exists an element of settlement which may be acceptable to the parties he is to proceed in accordance with the procedure laid down in Section 73, formulate the terms of a settlement and make it over to the parties for their observations; and the ultimate step to be taken by a Conciliator is to draw up a settlement in the light of the observations made by the parties to the terms formulated by him. The settlement takes shape only when the parties draw up the settlement agreement or request the Conciliator to prepare the same and affix their signatures to it. Under sub-section (3) of Section 73 the settlement agreement signed by the parties is final and binding on the parties and persons claiming under them. It follows, therefore, that a successful conciliation proceeding comes to an end only when the settlement agreement signed by the parties comes into existence. It is such an agreement which has the status and effect of legal sanctity of an arbitral award under Section 74.  [Para 19]\n\nIn the present case no such procedure  as prescribed under Part III of the Act has been followed by the Conciliator. The Conciliator appears to have held some meetings with the parties in which there was discussion and thereafter drew up the so-called settlement agreement by himself in secrecy and sent the same to the Court in a sealed cover. Naturally the so-called settlement agreement drawn up by the Conciliator does not bear the signatures of the parties. As the impugned order shows the said settlement has been given a status higher than an arbitral award inasmuch as the Court has refused to even entertain any objection against the said settlement agreement reiterating the position that the settlement arrived at by the Conciliator will be binding on the parties.  Held the learned Judge in passing the impugned order failed to notice the apparent illegalities committed by the Conciliator in drawing up the so-called settlement agreement, keeping it secret from the parties and sending it to the Court without obtaining their signature on the same. The position is well settled that if the statute prescribes a procedure for doing a thing, a thing has to be done according to that procedure. Thus the order passed by the High Court confirming the settlement agreement received from the Conciliator is wholly unsupportable.\n\nOrder dt. 6-10-1999 in Civil Appln. No. 7117 /1999 (Bom.)

[Para 21,21A,22]\n\nThe general rule of interpretation is that the retrospective operation is not taken to be intended unless that intention is manifested by express words or necessary implications. Section 85(1) of the new Act speaks about the repeal of the old Act. Section 85(2)(a) in clear words provides that notwithstanding the repeal of the old Act, all the provisions of the old Act shall apply in relation to the arbitral proceedings which had commenced before the new Act had come into force, of course, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. It also provides that all the proceedings commenced on or after 25-1-1996 shall be governed by the new Act. Besides, the provisions of law contained in the new Act disclose the intention of the Legislature against retrospective operation of the new Act. It abundantly makes it clear that the old Act would apply to the pending proceedings unless there is specific agreement to the contrary between the parties.  [Para 19,20]\n\nIn the instant case, the agreement spoken of is not one contrary to the provisions of law in force at the time of execution of the agreement but one in consonance with the provisions of the law in force. The option given to the parties to agree to contrary to the rule of applicability of the provisions of the old Act to the pending proceedings is in relation to the stage after coming into force of the new Act. There is nothing in the said provision to suggest even remotely any option to the parties to agree for anti-dating the enforcement of the new Act in relation to the pending proceedings. Besides, the saving clause specifically saves the repealed enactment for the purpose of its applicability to the pending proceedings. The provisions of law contained in the new Act materially differ from those in the old Act in relation to various procedural matters. It cannot be disputed that prior to 25th January, 1996 the parties were legally entitled to enforce the arbitration agreement in terms of provisions of the old Act. Therefore, any agreement to be governed by some other law contrary to the provisions of law in force at the relevant time would have been certainly a void agreement besides being hit by the provisions of Section 28 of the Contract Act.

It must be signed by both the parties.  The other categories of agreements in writing contemplated by sub-section (4) i.e. letters, telex, telegrams or other means of telecommunication which provide a record of the agreement or a statement of claim and defence clearly contemplate that such documents would be arbitration agreements in writing only when they are exchanged between the parties.  The purpose is clear enough.  The exchange signifies an active assent by both parties and a demonstrable meeting of minds of both parties as to the arbitration agreement.  Having regard to this context, in clause (a) when Parliament says \"document signed by the parties\" it intends a document signed by both the parties.  Though the acceptance of promises and obligations by conduct of parties is known to law, in cases where one party signs the documents and delivers it to the other party and the other party does not refute it but acts on it; it would be difficult to apply such a method of acceptance to a unilaterally signed separate arbitration agreement.  It would not be possible to know whether the other party who has received such an agreement has accepted and acted on it untill the very invocation of arbitration clause.  Moreover, if such unilaterally signed arbitration agreement is accepted as valid, it could enable a party to unilaterally sign an arbitration agreement after having decided on its scope and the terms of submissions to arbitration bind the other party.  The provision in question has been enacted to eliminate all such controversy regarding the existence of an arbitration agreement between the parties.  In order to achieve that purpose, Parliament has clearly intended by saying so in clear words that the agreement would be an agreement in writing if it is contained in a document signed by the parties.  Parliament did not use the words in plural accidentally.  It did so deliberately.  Having come to the conclusion that the word \"parties\" was used with the specific intention to mean both the parties, it would be of no avail to resort to section 13 of the General Clauses Act, 1897.

In situations where the relevant clause made reference to the applicability of \"the provisions of the Indian Arbitration Act and Rules made thereunder\" on the strength of Section 85(2)(a) the governing provisions in respect of arbitral proceedings which had not commenced before 1996 had come into force would be those of 1996 Act alone. On the same reasoning even if an arbitration agreement entered into after 1996 Act had come into force were to make a reference to the applicable provisions of those under Indian Arbitration Act or 1940 Act, such stipulation would be of no consequence and the matter must be governed under provisions of 1996 Act. An incorrect reference or recital regarding applicability of 1940 Act would not render the entire arbitration agreement invalid. Such stipulation will have to be read in the light of Section 85 of 1996 Act and principles governing such relationship have to be under and in tune with 1996 Act.

I of Stamp Act, is not liable for stamp duty - Hence, fact that foreign award is unstamped, would not render it unenforceable.\n\n\tOn a reading of the relevant provisions of Stamp Act (1899), it becomes clear that the only \"award\" that is referred to in the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 is an award that is made in the territory of British India provided that such award is not made pursuant to a reference made by an order of the Court in the course of a suit. At this point in time, it is important to note that there were several princely states in India governed by sovereign rulers which had their own laws. Arbitration laws, if any, in the aforesaid princely states, if they were to culminate in awards, would not be ''awards'' under either the Civil Procedure Code, 1882 or the Indian Arbitration Act, 1899. They would therefore be foreign awards insofar as British India is concerned. An award made in a princely state, or in a foreign country, if enforced by means of a suit in British India, would not be covered by the expression \"award\" contained in Item 12 of Schedule I of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. Only awards which are decisions in writing by an arbitrator or umpire, made in British India, on a reference made otherwise than by an order of the Court in the course of a suit would be included.\n\n\tIt will thus be seen that \"award\" under Item 12 of Schedule I of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 has remained unchanged till date. In 1899, this \"award\" would refer only to a decision in writing by an arbitrator or umpire in a reference not made by an order of the Court in the course of a suit. This would apply only to such award made at the time in British India, and today, after the amendment of Section 1(2) of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 by Act 43 of 1955, to awards made in the whole of India except the State of Jammu and Kashmir. This being the case, the expression \"award\" has never included a foreign award from the very inception till date. Consequently, a foreign award not being includible in Schedule I of the Indian Stamp Act, 1899, is not liable for stamp duty.\n\n\tTherefore, fact that a foreign award has not borne stamp duty under the Indian Stamp Act, 1899 would not render it unenforceable.\n\n(2013) 2 MP LJ 252 Ref. to.

                "description": "Invocation of arbitration clause - Pre-requisites for - Dispute primarily raised before Municipal Commissioner but remained unresolved - Party 'A' then invoked arbitration Clause i.e. Clause 97 of the contract - Contention that contractor cannot raise claims by invoking arbitration clause without raising it before Municipal Commissioner or invoking Clause 96 - Clause 96 states that if contractor is not satisfied with decision of Municipal Commissioner or the Commissioner fails to give his decision within period of 90 days - Then the dispute may be referred to arbitration - However, nothing in Clause 97 to suggest that arbitration can be invoked only in respect of disputes of differences raised u/Cl.96 - Therefore, invocation of Clause 96 is not a must for invoking Clause 97.\n\n\tIn the instant case Hence Clause 96 of the General conditions of the contract postulates that any doubt, dispute or difference arises or happens between the Engineer or any other officer on the one hand and the Contractor on the other hand, touching or concerning the said works or any of them, or relating to the various matters mentioned therein i.e. in Clause 96 or touching or concerning any certificate, order, or reward which have been made or in any way whatsoever relating to the interests of the Municipal Corporation or of the Contractor in the premises, every such doubt, dispute and difference shall from time to time be referred to the Municipal Commissioner who shall give his decision within a period of 90 days and if the contractor is not satisfied with the decision of the Municipal Commissioner or the Municipal Commissioner fails to give the decision within the period of 90 days, such dispute may be referred to arbitration as per Condition No.97.\n\n\tA reading of Clause 97 discloses that all disputes or differences whatsoever which shall at any time arise between the parties i.e. the Contractor and the Municipal Corporation and not merely between the Engineer and the Contractor as in Clause 96, regarding the matters mentioned in Clause 97 or to the rights or liabilities of the parties or arising out of or in relation thereto whether during or after completion of the contract or whether before or after determination, foreclosure or breach of the contract, excluding the matters mentioned in the said Clause 97, shall after written notice by either party to the contract to the other of them specify the nature of such dispute or difference and call for the point or points at issue.\n\n\tThe said Clause 97 thereafter provides the mechanism for appointment of the arbitrator, the law under which the arbitration is to be conducted, the person who can be appointed as arbitrator, the replacement of the arbitrator, the manner in which the arbitrator would proceed and how the costs of the arbitrator were to be fixed.\n\n\tA reading of Clause 97 therefore discloses that the said Clause is worded in a different manner than Clause 96. The said clause encompasses all the disputes or differences touching the works under the contract awarded. The defining aspect of Clause 97 is that the rights and liabilities of the parties arising out of and in relation to the contract before or after determination, foreclosure or breach of the contract can be referred to arbitration. Hence Clause 97 is the arbitration clause in so far as the contract is concerned. \t\n\n\tHence a conjoint reading of Clause 96 and Clause 97 indicates that the parties have provided themselves a dual mechanism i.e. Clause 96 providing for doubts, disputes and differences arising at the time of the execution of the works, being resolved in a particular manner, and then Clause 97 which is an arbitration clause which can be said to be all encompassing. Significantly in Clause 97 there is no reference to Clause 96 which can be said to be a defining feature of the agreement, in so far as the present works contract is concerned. Hence Clause 97 can be said to be a stand alone arbitration clause whose invocation is not contingent upon invocation of Clause 96. Further, Clause 96 and Clause 97 are worded differently and though it is mentioned in Clause 96 that if the contractor is not satisfied with the decision of the Commissioner or the Commissioner fails to give his decision within the period of 90 days, then the dispute may be referred to arbitration as per Clause 97, in the instant case, there is nothing in Clause 97 to suggest that it is only in respect of the disputes or differences raised under Clause 96, that the arbitration can be invoked under Clause 97. In our view, Clause 97 being widely worded, the disputes which have arisen under Clause 96 and their reference to arbitration can only be one of the facets of Clause 97, but not the only facet. In our view, therefore invocation of Clause 96 is not a must for invoking Clause 97 and that a claim for the first time can be made before the arbitrator by following the procedure laid down in Clause 97.\n\n2006 (2) Bom.

Such a proceeding is not dependent upon the pendency of any other proceedings such as any suit or appeal. As a matter of fact, Section 9 itself makes it clear that an application seeking interim measure, as provided therein, may be made even before any arbitral proceedings are commenced. In other words, even before commencement of arbitral proceedings, an application under Section 9 can be filed and such application, being original in nature, would stand on the same footing as the proceedings within the meaning of Section 141 of the CPC. As observed earlier that no special procedure is prescribed by the Act for dealing with an application for interim measure/order under Section 9 thereof and further when power is conferred under a special statue on a Civil court without laying down any special condition for exercise of that power, the general rules that governed the Court while considering the grant of interim measure/order at the threshold are attracted. Thus, when an application under Section 9 is made and during pendency of such application, an ex parte ad interim order becomes imperative, in the facts and circumstances of the case, it is open to the Court to pass an ad interim ex parte order based on well recognized principles contemplated by the provisions of Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2 of the CPC governing the grant of interim injunctions and/or other orders of interim protection or the appointment of a Receiver. The power to grant an ex parte interim order is derived by a Court under the principle that every Court has the power to pass an order, which it must pass so as to ensure that the application, made before it, does not become infructuous merely because of the fact that no specific provision has been made dispensing, in an emergent situation, the necessity to pass an ex parte order. In other words, the Court cannot be stated to be completely helpless in the matter of an ad-interim order/measure otherwise the entire purpose of the application under Section 9 of the Act would stand defeated, if ultimately the party approaching the Court under Section 9 succeeds in the Arbitration proceedings. It is difficult to conceive that the Legislature, so intended while providing the remedy to a party to approach the Court under section 9 of the Act. In short, when any power is expressly granted by a statute, there is impliedly included in the grant, even without special mention, every power and every control, the denial of which would render the grant itself ineffective. The Court as defined under Section 2(e) of the Act, is undoubtedly entitled to dispose of the application filed under Section 9 of the Act even before initiation of arbitral proceedings under Section 21 of the Act. The Court, however, cannot dispose of such application ex parte without giving notice to the respondents, but Court can pass ex parte ad interim order pending the application filed under Section 9 of the Act.\t  [Para 18,19]"

                "description": "Appointment of arbitrator - Question whether claim is barred by res judicata cannot be gone into in proceedings under S.11.\n\nThe question whether a claim is barred by res judicata, does not arise for consideration in a proceedings under section 11 of the Act. Such an issue will have to be examined by the arbitral tribunal. A decision on res judicata requires consideration of the pleadings as also the claims/issues/points and the award in the first round of arbitration, in juxtaposition with the pleadings and the issues/points/claims in the second arbitration. The limited scope of section 11 of the Act does not permit such examination of the maintainability or tenability of a claim either on facts or in law. It is for the arbitral tribunal to examine and decide whether the claim was barred by res judicata. There can be no threshold consideration and rejection of a claim on the ground of res judicata, while considering an application under section 11 of the Act.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 13]\n\nTo find out whether a claim is barred by res judicata, or whether a claim is \"mala fide\", it will be necessary to examine the facts and relevant documents. What is to be decided in an application under section 11 of the Act is whether there is an arbitration agreement between parties. The Chief Justice or his designate is not expected to go into the merits of the claim or examine the tenability of the claim, in an application under section 11 of the Act. The Chief Justice or his Designate may however choose to decide whether the claim is a dead (long-barred) claim or whether the parties have, by recording satisfaction, exhausted all rights, obligations and remedies under the contract, so that neither the contract nor the arbitration agreement survived. When it is said that the Chief Justice or his Designate may choose to decide whether the claim is a dead claim, it is implied that he will do so only when the claim is evidently and patently a long time barred claim and there is no need for any detailed consideration of evidence.   [Para 11]\n\nThus, an application under section 11 of the Act is expected to contain pleadings about the existence of a dispute and the existence of an arbitration agreement to decide such dispute. The applicant is not expected to justify the claim or plead exhaustively in regard to limitation or produce documents to demonstrate that the claim is within time in a proceedings under section 11 of the Act. That issue should normally be left to the Arbitral Tribunal.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 12]\n\nIn the instant case on a perusal of the order of the Designate, it is clear that the Designate has clearly exceeded his limited jurisdiction under section 11 of the Act, by deciding that the claim for extra cost, though covered by the arbitration agreement was barred by limitation and by the principle of res judiata. He was also not justified in terming the application under section 11 of the Act as 'misconceived and malafide'. Nor could he attribute 'mala fides' to the appellant, a public sector company, in filing an application under section 11 of the Act, without any material to substantiate it. The Designate should have avoided the risks and dangers involved in deciding an issue relating to the tenability of the claim without necessary pleadings and documents, in a proceeding relating to the limited issue of appointing an Arbitrator. It is clear that the Designate committed a jurisdictional error in dismissing the application filed by the appellant under section 11 of the Act, on the ground that the claim for extra cost was barred by res judicata and by limitation. Consideration of an application under section 11 of the Act, does not extend to consideration of the merits of the claim or the chances of success of the claim.   [Para 18,19]"

(i) Fraud committed in the notice of the bank which would vitiate the very foundation of guarantee; (ii) injustice of the kind which would make it impossible for the guarantor to reimburse himself.

                ],
                "description": "Arbitrability of award - Production sharing contracts between three petroleum companies - Proceedings were to be held by arbitrators in London - Disputes between Reliance Industries Limited (RIL) and Union of India referred to arbitration - In partial award tribunal holding that claims of royalties, cess, service tax and audit were arbitrable - Union of India challenging award before Delhi High Court u/S.34 - Maintainability - Held, petition was not maintainable - Remedy was to approach Tribunal in London and courts there will decide issue by applying Indian law as principles of public policy etc.\n\nOnce the parties had consciously agreed that the juridical seat of the arbitration would be London and that the arbitration agreement will be governed by the laws of England, it was no longer open to them to contend that the provisions of Part I of the Arbitration Act would also be applicable to the arbitration agreement. The provisions of Part I of the Arbitration Act 1996 (Indian) are necessarily excluded; being wholly inconsistent with the arbitration agreement which provides \"that arbitration agreement shall be governed by English law.\" Thus the remedy of the respondent to challenge any award rendered in the arbitration proceedings would lie under the relevant provisions contained in Arbitration Act, 1996 of England and Wales. Whether or not such an application would now be entertained by the courts in England would have to be examined by the Court of Competent Jurisdiction in England.  [Para 43,56]\n\nThe basis for filing the petition under Section 34 is that the Appellants are bound to obey the Laws of the country. The appellants have nowhere claimed to be exempted from the Laws of India. They claim that the Government of India, party to the Contract, has failed to seek and obtain exemption as stipulated in the contract. Whether or not the claim has substance is surely an arbitral matter. It is not the case of the appellants that they are not bound by the Laws of India, relating to the performance of the contractual obligations under the PSCs. The arbitration agreement can not be jettisoned on the plea that award, if made against the Government of India, would violate Public Policy of India. Merely because the Arbitral Tribunal has held that claims are arbitral does not mean that the claims have been accepted and an award adverse to India has been given.   [Para 59]\n\nThe High Court has also failed to notice that by now it is settled, in almost all international jurisdictions, that the agreement to arbitrate is a separate contract distinct from the substantive contract which contains the arbitration agreement. This principle of severability of the arbitration agreement from the substantive contract is indeed statutorily recognized by Section 16 of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1996.  [Para 60]\n\nApplicability of Part I of Arbitration Act, 1996 is not dependent on the nature of challenge to the award. Whether or not the award is challenged on the ground of public policy, it would have to satisfy the pre-condition that the Arbitration Act, 1996 is applicable to the arbitration agreement. The High Court has committed a jurisdictional error in holding that the provisions contained in Article 33.12 is relevant only for the determination of the curial law applicable to the proceedings. The parties by agreement have provided that the juridical seat of the arbitration shall be in London. Necessary amendment has also been made in the PSCs, as recorded by the Final Partial Consent Award. It is noteworthy that the Arbitration Act, 1996 does not define or mention juridical seat. The term 'juridical seat' on the other hand is specifically defined in Section 3 of the English Arbitration Act. Therefore, this would clearly indicate that the parties understood that the arbitration law of England would be applicable to the arbitration agreement.     [Para 72]\n\nHence the petition filed by respondents under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996 in the Delhi High Court is not maintainable. In the event, the award is sought to be enforced outside India, it would leave the Indian party remediless is without any basis as the parties have consensually provided that the arbitration agreement will be governed by the English law. Therefore, the remedy against the award will have to be sought in England, where the juridical seat is located. However, since substantive law governing the contract is Indian Law, even the Courts in England, in case the arbitrability is challenged, will have to decide the issue by applying Indian Law viz. the principle of public policy etc. as it prevails in Indian Law.

The interim measure of protection contemplated therein therefore has to be a measure of protection i. e. with a view to preserve situation prevailing and to keep property available to answer final adjudication as and when final award is passed by the Arbitrator. The direction issued by Arbitrator to Nagpur Improvement Trust to issue necessary no objection certificate to Contractor to enable him to fulfill and honour commercial arrangements with the prospective purchasers or then to enable him to mortgage the project to obtain financial assistance are not interim measures contemplated in Section 17 of the Arbitration Act. These steps cannot be viewed as interim measures of \"protection\". On the contrary, under the guise of those interim measures directions issued are to take steps to further specifically perform the alleged obligations of Nagpur Improvement Trust as per agreement dated 23.7.2002. Thus, on one hand, the parties are seeking modification in terms and conditions of agreement dated 23.7.2002 & are before Arbitrator for that purpose, & on the other hand Contractor is seeking specific enforcement thereof . The Arbitrator has to resolve that controversy on merits & without resolving it, the directions have been issued to take steps which in fact result in further execution of the agreement dated 23.7.2002. If no objection certificate as directed for is issued and lease with perspective customers or then a mortgage is allowed to take place, it is apparent that third party interests are created and situation becomes irreversible one. It can not be therefore to reversed at the stage of final adjudication by the Arbitrator without adversely affecting the third party interests resulting therefrom. Creation of such situation cannot be viewed as an interim measure at all.  (1991)1 SCC 533 and (2007)6 SCC 798 - Ref. to.\t [Para 33]"

It provides arbitral procedure which is fair, efficient and capable of meeting the needs of all concerned, with judicial intervention kept at minimal level. While it is an experience that there is delay in justice delivery system mostly due to time consuming tactics, the arbitral procedure provides for a ray of hope for an easy and expedient mechanism to enforce rights and obligations under the contract. Thus, an arbitration clause in a contract is an extremely important collateral clause capable of meeting the needs of the parties concerned. When an arbitration clause is incorporated in a contract in a clear and unambiguous words, the true effect of it cannot be changed when it can cover all disputes arising out of and in relation to the contract. It is for these reasons that the arbitration clause in a contract is needed to be construed as stand alone, severable, as also final and binding between the parties to the contract. Thus, an arbitration clause stands apart from the rest of the contract in which it is contained, in the sense, that it does not impose obligation upon one party and in favour of the other, but lays down that if any dispute arises with regard to the obligation which one party has undertaken to the other party, such a dispute shall be settled by arbitration. A mechanism which is strong enough to meet myriad situations of every kind is provided under the Act for difficulties in enforcement of an arbitration clause in the contract.  2009 ALL SCR 2368 - Ref. to. \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 16]"

An arbitration agreement is required to be in writing i.e., in a document by the parties or spelled out from communication between the parties or by admission in exchange of statements as to claim or defence which may be in the form of arbitration clause in a written contract or in the form of a separate agreement. Even if there is a reference in a written contract to a document containing an arbitration clause, it would be constituted or construed as an arbitration agreement in relation to written contract between the parties.\n\nOnce it is shown that an arbitration clause or agreement is existing, a judicial authority before which action is brought has power to refer parties to arbitration. Section 8 enables a judicial authority to exercise power to refer parties to arbitration upon an application, accompanied with the duly certified copy of arbitration agreement, when made by the applicant at the earliest opportunity before submission of his statement on the substance of the dispute. During the pendency of such application, an arbitration may commence or continue and an arbitral award may be made, subject to interim measures that may be taken by the Court under Section 9 of the Act.\t\t\t\t\t  [Para 17,19]"

It does not necessarily posit the acceptance by the person of the mandate. Thus if the person named in the arbitration agreement does not accept the mandate, he becomes unable to perform his functions as an arbitrator within the meaning of section 14(1)(a). The mandate given to him therefore terminates. \n\nThus the mandate of the two persons named in clause (viii) stood terminated upon their having stated that they were unable to act as arbitrators. A party is then entitled to have the vacancy thereby caused to be filled under section 15(2).\n\nThere is nothing in the 1996 Act which indicates that where a person named in an arbitration agreement refuses or is unable to act as an arbitrator the vacancy caused thereby cannot be filled if there is no intention not to fill the same or even if the intention is to fill the same. Where the intention is to refer the dispute to the arbitration of a particular person only, it is a composite agreement where, in the absence of such person acting as an arbitrator the arbitration agreement perishes as a whole. Thus upon such person being unable to act as an arbitrator for any reason the agreement to refer the disputes itself gets exhausted and ceases to exist. This is axiomatic for then its existence being dependent upon the named arbitrators acting as such, in their absence there is no agreement to refer the disputes to arbitration at all.\n\nHowever where the parties agree to refer the disputes which may arise to arbitration per se, in principle and not to a particular person or persons only the agreement to refer the disputes to arbitration subsists for it is not dependent upon the named arbitrators accepting the reference. What the court even under the 1996 Act enforces in that case is the agreement to refer the disputes to arbitration. \n\nA view to the contrary is not only not warranted by the provisions of the 1996 Act and is contrary thereto but derogates against the legislative policy underlying the 1996 Act.

                "description": "Appointment of arbitrator - Scheme of appointment of arbitrators summarised.\n\nThe scope of section 11 of the Act containing the scheme of appointment of arbitrators may be summarised thus:\n\n(i)\tWhere the agreement provides for arbitration with three arbitrators (each party to appoint one arbitrator and the two appointed arbitrators to appoint a third arbitrator), in the event of a party failing to appoint an Arbitrator within 30 days from the receipt of a request from the other party (or the two nominated arbitrators failing to agree on the third arbitrator within 30 days from the date of the appointment), the Chief Justice or his designate will exercise power under sub-section (4) of section 11 of the Act.\n\n(ii)\tWhere the agreement provides for arbitration by a sole arbitrator and the parties have not agreed upon any appointment procedure, the Chief Justice or his designate will exercise power under sub-section (5) of section 11, if the parties fail to agree on the arbitration within thirty days from the receipt of a request by a party from the other party.\n\n(iii)\tWhere the arbitration agreement specifies the appointment procedure, then irrespective of whether the arbitration is by a sole arbitrator or by a three-member Tribunal, the Chief Justice or his designate will exercise power under sub-section (6) of section 11, if a party fails to act as required under the agreed procedure (or the parties or the two appointed arbitrators fail to reach an agreement expected of them under the agreed procedure or any person/institution fails to perform any function entrusted to him/it under that procedure).\n\n(iv)\tWhile failure of the other party to act within 30 days will furnish a cause of action to the party seeking arbitration to approach the Chief Justice or his designate in cases falling under sub-sections (4) & (5), such a time-bound requirement is not found in sub-section (6) of section 11. The failure to act as per the agreed procedure within the time-limit prescribed by the arbitration agreement, or in the absence of any prescribed time-limit, within a reasonable time, will enable the aggrieved party to file a petition under Section 11(6) of the Act.\n\n(v)\tWhere the appointment procedure has been agreed between the parties, but the cause of action for invoking the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice or his designate under clauses (a), (b) or (c) of sub-section (6) has not arisen, then the question of Chief Justice or his designate exercising power under sub-section (6) does not arise. The condition precedent for approaching the Chief Justice or his designate for taking necessary measures under sub-section (6) is that (i) a party failing to act as required under the agreed appointment procedure; or (ii) the parties (or the two appointed arbitrators), failing to reach an agreement expected of them under the agreed appointment procedure; or (iii) a person/institution who has been entrusted with any function under the agreed appointment procedure, failing to perform such function.\n\n(vi)\tThe Chief Justice or his designate while exercising power under sub-section (6) of section 11 shall endeavour to give effect to the appointment procedure prescribed in the arbitration clause.\n\n(vii)\tIf circumstances exist, giving rise to justifiable doubts as to the independence and impartiality of the person nominated, or if other circumstances warrant appointment of an independent arbitrator by ignoring the procedure prescribed, the Chief Justice or his designate may, for reasons to be recorded ignore the designated arbitrator and appoint someone else.

Under this provision, any prior agreement to the contrary is wiped out by the non-obstante clause in Section 12(5) the moment any person whose relationship with the parties or the counsel or the subject matter of the dispute falls under the Seventh Schedule. The sub-section then declares that such person shall be \u201cineligible\u201d to be appointed as arbitrator. The only way in which this ineligibility can be removed is by the proviso, which again is a special provision which states that parties may, subsequent to disputes having arisen between them, waive the applicability of Section 12(5) by an express agreement in writing. What is clear, therefore, is that where, under any agreement between the parties, a person falls within any of the categories set out in the Seventh Schedule, he is, as a matter of law, ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator. The only way in which this ineligibility can be removed, in law, is that parties may after disputes have arisen between them, waive the applicability of this sub-section by an \u201cexpress agreement in writing\u201d. (Para 15)\n\nUnlike Section 4 of the Act which deals with deemed waiver of the right to object by conduct, the proviso to Section 12(5) will only apply if subsequent to disputes having arisen between the parties, the parties waive the applicability of sub-section (5) of Section 12 by an express agreement in writing. For this reason, the argument based on the analogy of Section 7 of the Act must also be rejected. Section 7 deals with arbitration agreements that must be in writing, and then explains that such agreements may be contained in documents which provide a record of such agreements. On the other hand, Section 12(5) refers to an \u201cexpress agreement in writing\u201d. The expression \u201cexpress agreement in writing\u201d refers to an agreement made in words as opposed to an agreement which is to be inferred by conduct. (Para 20)"

However, where such person becomes \u201cineligible\u201d to be appointed as an arbitrator, there is no question of challenge to such arbitrator, before such arbitrator. In such a case, i.e., a case which falls under Section 12(5), Section 14(1)(a) of the Act gets attracted inasmuch as the arbitrator becomes, as a matter of law (i.e., de jure), unable to perform his functions under Section 12(5), being ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator. This being so, his mandate automatically terminates, and he shall then be substituted by another arbitrator under Section 14(1) itself. It is only if a controversy occurs concerning whether he has become de jure unable to perform his functions as such, that a party has to apply to the Court to decide on the termination of the mandate, unless otherwise agreed by the parties. Thus, in all Section 12(5) cases, there is no challenge procedure to be availed of. If an arbitrator continues as such, being de jure unable to perform his functions, as he falls within any of the categories mentioned in Section 12(5), read with the Seventh Schedule, a party may apply to the Court, which will then decide on whether his mandate has terminated.

                "description": "Application for setting aside award - Limitation - Provisions of S.14 would be applicable to the fullest extent but not S.5 - Time taken for diligently pursuing remedy in wrong Court can be excluded.\n\nPer, J. M. Panchal, J.:-\tWhen any special statute prescribes certain period of limitation as well as provision for extension upto specified time limit, on sufficient cause being shown, then the period of limitation prescribed under the special law shall prevail and to that extent the provisions of the Limitation Act shall stand excluded.  As the intention of the legislature in enacting sub-section (3) of Section 34 of the Act is that the application for setting aside the award should be made within three months and the period can be further extended on sufficient cause being shown by another period of 30 days but not thereafter, the provisions of Section 5 of the Limitation Act would not be applicable because the applicability of Section 5 of the Limitation Act stands excluded because of the provisions of Section 29(2) of the Limitation Act. However, merely because it is held that Section 5 of the Limitation Act is not applicable to an application filed under Section 34 of the Act for setting aside an award, one need not conclude that provisions of Section 14 of the Limitation Act would also not be applicable to an application submitted under Section 34 of the Act of 1996. [Para 26,27]\n\nUpon the words used in section 14, it is not possible to sustain the interpretation that the principle underlying the said section, namely, that the bar of limitation should not affect a person honestly doing his best to get his case tried on merits but failing because the court is unable to give him such a trial, would not be applicable to an application filed under Section 34 of the Act of 1996.  The principle is clearly applicable not only to a case in which a litigant brings his application in the court, that is, a court having no jurisdiction to entertain it but also where he brings the suit or the application in the wrong court in consequence of bona fide mistake or law or defect of procedure.  Having regard to the intention of the legislature this Court is of the firm opinion that the equity underlying Section 14 should be applied to its fullest extent and time taken diligently pursuing a remedy, in a wrong court, should be excluded.  \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 28]\n\nIf the period between the commencement of the arbitration proceedings till the award is set aside by the court, has to be excluded in computing the period of limitation provided for any proceedings with respect to the dispute, there is no good reason as to why it should not be held that the provisions of Section 14 of the Limitation Act would be applicable to an application submitted under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 more particularly where  no provision is to be found in the Act of 1996, which excludes the applicability of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, to an application made under Section 34 of the Act.  It is to be noticed that the powers under Section 34 of the Act can be exercised by the court only if the aggrieved party makes an application.  The jurisdiction under Section 34 of the Act, cannot be exercised, suo motu.  The total period of four months within which an application, for setting aside an arbitral award, has to be made is not unusually long.  Section 34 of the Act of 1996 would be unduly oppressive, if it is held that the provisions of Section 14 of the Limitation Act are not applicable to it, because cases are no doubt conceivable where an aggrieved party, despite exercise of due diligence and good faith, is unable to make an application within a period of 4 months.  From the scheme and language of Section 34 of the Act of 1996, the intention of the Legislature to exclude, the applicability of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, is not manifest.  It is well to remember that Section 14 of the Limitation Act does not provide for a fresh period of limitation but only provides for the exclusion of a certain period.  Having regard to the legislative intent, it will have to be held that the provisions of Section 14 of the Limitation Act, 1963 would be applicable to an application submitted under Section 34 of the Act of 1996 for setting aside an arbitral award.   [Para 29]\n\nPer R. V. Raveendran, J.:- The Limitation Act applies only to proceedings in court, and but for the express provision in section 43, the Limitation Act would not have applied to arbitration, as Arbitrators are Private Tribunals and not courts. Section 43 of the AC Act, apart from making the provisions of Limitation Act, 1963 applicable to arbitrations, reiterates that Limitation Act applies to proceedings in court.  Therefore, the provisions of Limitation Act, 1963 apply to all proceedings under the AC Act, both in court and in arbitration, except to the extent expressly excluded by the provisions of the AC Act.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 8]\n\nSection 5 of Limitation Act does not place any outer limit in regard to the period of extension, whereas the proviso to sub-section 3 of section 34 of the AC Act places a limit on the period of extension of the period of limitation. Thus the proviso to sub-section 34(3) of the AC Act is also a provision relating to extension of period of limitation, but differs from section 5 of the Limitation Act, in regard to period of extension, and has the effect of excluding section 5 alone of the Limitation Act. On the other hand, Section 14 contained in Part III of Limitation Act does not relate to extension of the period of limitation, but relates to exclusion of certain period while computing the period of limitation. Neither sub-section (3) of section 34 of the AC Act nor any other provision of the AC Act exclude the applicability of section 14 of the Limitation Act to applications under section 34(1) of the AC Act. Nor will the proviso to section 34(3) exclude the application of section 14, as section 14 is not a provision for extension of period of limitation, but for exclusion of certain period while computing the period of limitation. Having regard to section 29(2) of Limitation Act, section 14 of that Act will be applicable to an application under section 34(1) of the AC Act. Even when there is cause to apply section 14, the limitation period continues to be three months and not more, but in computing the limitation period of three months for the application under section 34(1) of the AC Act, the time during which the applicant was prosecuting such application before the wrong court is excluded, provided the proceeding in the wrong court was prosecuted bona fide, with due diligence.  2006(6) SCC 239 - Rel.on.

Civil P.C. (1908), S.151.\n\nAn award is distinct from an order and the order would not constitute an award in terms of section 31 and therefore the award cannot be challenged under Section 34. Even if a wider interpretation is given to Section 33 to include orders passed under Section 32(2) the jurisdiction is limited to correction of errors in terms of sub-section (1)(a) or to give an interpretation of a specific point or part of the award. This could only be in the event there was some ambiguity in the award. Under sub-section (4) if there was a requirement to decide a claim then also the Arbitral Tribunal has jurisdiction. This could be only where the award passed had omitted a decision on a claim. Therefore, it is clear that the expression order and award are distinct and different and that the decision given under Section 25(1)(a) is an order terminating the proceedings.  [Para 11]\n\nIn the present case Section 5 of the Act of 1996 makes it clear, that no judicial authority which would include Courts, can intervene except where so provided in this Part. Therefore, unless there is a remedy provided under the Act it would be impossible to accept the plea that High court can exercise its suo motu powers which in the present case would mean its inherent powers. Once the Act expressly excludes judicial interference it will be impossible to exercise the powers under Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  [Para 14]\n\nSection 11 by itself may not be an answer for holding that it is the Section which provides the remedy, wherein the Chief Justice or the person or institution designated by him can decide whether the decision is a nullity whilst considering the application for reference or appointment of Arbitrator and thereafter refer the matter to arbitration.  [Para 16]\n\nThe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 has made a departure and an arbitral Tribunal under the Act of 1996 can be said to be a person if not a Tribunal to whom a writ could go. The reasons are as under :- Reading of Section 8 with Section 5 of the Act of 1996 in cases where there is an arbitration agreement, no judicial authority can intervene except when so provided in the Act. The jurisdiction is exclusive. Section 10 controls the composition of the Arbitral Tribunal. Section 16 confers a power upon the Tribunal to decide on its own jurisdiction. Section 17 has conferred a power on the Tribunal to make an order as an interim measure for protection of the subject matter of a dispute. Under Section 37 such an order granting or rejecting interim relief is subject to appeal to the Court. Under Sub-section (4) of Section 19 the Arbitral Tribunal has been given power to determine the admissibility, relevance, materiality and weight of any evidence. Under Section 25 the Tribunal can terminate the proceedings if claims statement is not filed within the time stipulated under Section 23 and if no sufficient cause is shown. Under proviso to Section 24(1) the Tribunal is bound to grant oral hearing on request by the parties. More important is sub-section (5) of Section 27 if persons are guilty of any contempt of the Arbitral Tribunal during the conduct of arbitral proceedings they are subject to the like disadvantages, penalties and punishments by order of the Court on the representation of the arbitral tribunal as they would incur for like offences in suits tried before the Court. In the Act of 1940 there was no specific reference to contempt of arbitral tribunal which has been conferred by Section 27 of the Act of 1996. Once a person can be punished for contempt of the Tribunal, which can be done where the Act tends to bring the administration of justice into disrespect or interference with the administration of justice, shows that such a 'Tribunal' discharges the inherent judicial functions of the State. By virtue of Section 36 the Award is deemed to be a decree which can be enforced under the Act unlike the Act of 1940 when it had to be made a decree by the order of the Court. Under Section 37(2), an Appeal is provided for against certain orders made by the Arbitral Tribunal. In other words its orders are appealable. On consideration of those provisions even if it be held that the tribunal is not a tribunal within the meaning of Article 226 of the Constitution, it would nevertheless be a person to whom a writ could go under Article 226 of the Constitution. I am, therefore, clearly of the opinion that where a remedy is not available to an aggrieved person and considering Section 5 of the Arbitration Act of 1996 High Court can exercise its extra ordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution. This exercise had to be undergone in view of non-availability of remedy to aggrieved parties. It is true also that one of the objectives of the Act of 1996 is to minimise the supervisory role of Courts. On the other hand proceedings in arbitration involve the civil rights of the parties. It is a cardinal principle of our jurisprudence that no man should be left without a remedy. Judicial review cannot be made dependent on men who pass orders. Hierarchy of Courts is an answer to that.  [Para 17,19]\n\nA defect of jurisdiction, whether it is pecuniary or territorial, or whether it is in respect of the subject matter of the action, strikes at the very authority of the Court to pass any decree, and such a defect cannot be cured even by consent of parties. In the instant case even assuming that there could have been a waiver, as already held, the objection was not waived and consequently the composition of the tribunal being contrary to law was without jurisdiction and hence decision given to terminate the proceedings by order dated 18th July, 1997 culminating into the decision of 1st August, 1997 will have to be quashed and set aside on that count.\n\nAIR 1954 SC 340 Ref.

The other factors which are relevant include, whether the agreement contemplates that the Tribunal will receive evidence from both sides and hear their contentions or at least give the parties an opportunity to put them forward; whether the wording of the agreement is consistent or inconsistent with the view that the process was intended to be an arbitration, and whether the agreement requires the Tribunal decide the dispute according to law.

If a person aggrieved is certain that the grounds for setting aside of the award under section 34 of the Arbitration Act exist, he may not file an appeal under Bye-law 274-A but may straight away challenge the award under section 34.  Bye law 274-A grants him an alternate and appellate remedy.  Bye law 274-A does not cast any restrictions on the powers of the Appeal Bench and all questions of law as well as facts can be agitated before the Appeal Bench.  On appeal, award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal at the first instance would merge into the judgment and the award of the Appeal Bench.  It is the judgment and Award of the Appeal Bench which would govern the rights and liabilities of the parties.  Once the appellate award is passed, the award passed by the Arbitral Tribunal at the first instance would not separately exist and would merge into the award of the Appeal Bench and it would no longer be open to any party then to challenge the original award under Bye-law 260.  Under clause 11 of the Bye law 274-A, the provisions of Bye law 260 are applicable to the appellate award and a petition under section 34 of the Arbitration Act can be filed challenging the appellate award.

If the terms of the agreement clearly indicate an intention on the part of the parties to the agreement to refer their disputes to a private tribunal for adjudication and willingness to be bound by the decision of such tribunal on such disputes, it is arbitration agreement.  While there is no specific form of an arbitration agreement, the words used should disclose a determination and obligation to go to arbitration and not merely contemplate the possibility of going for arbitration.  Where there is merely a possibility of the parties agreeing to arbitration in future, as contrasted from an obligation to refer disputes to arbitration, there is no valid and binding arbitration agreement.\n\n(ii) Even if the words 'arbitration' and 'arbitral tribunal (or arbitrator)' are not used with reference to the process of settlement or with reference to the private tribunal which has to adjudicate upon the disputes, in a clause relating to settlement of disputes, it does not detract from the clause being an arbitration agreement if it has the attributes or elements of an arbitration agreement.  They are : (a) The agreement should be in writing. (b) The parties should have agreed to refer any disputes (present of future) between them to the decision of a private tribunal. (c) The private tribunal should be empowered to adjudicate upon the disputes in an impartial manner, giving due opportunity to the parties to put forth their case before it. (d) The parties should have agreed that the decision of the Private Tribunal in respect of the disputes will be binding on them.\n\n(iii) Where the clause provides that in the event of disputes arising between the parties, the disputes shall be referred to Arbitration, it is an arbitration agreement.  Where there is a specific and direct expression of intent to have the disputes settled by arbitration, it is not necessary to set out the attributes of an arbitration agreement to make it an arbitration agreement.  But where the clause relating to settlement of disputes, contain words which specifically excludes any of the attributes of an arbitration agreement or contains anything that detracts from an arbitration agreement, it will not be an arbitration agreement.  For example, where an agreement requires or permits an authority to decide a claim or dispute without hearing, or requires the authority to act in the interests of only one of the parties, or provides that the decision of the Authority will not be final and binding on the parties, or that if either party is not satisfied with the decision of the Authority, he may file a civil suit seeking relief, it cannot be termed as an arbitration agreement.\n\n(iv) But mere use of the word 'arbitration' or 'arbitrator' in a clause will not make it an arbitration agreement, if it requires or contemplates a further or fresh consent of the parties for reference to arbitration.  For example, use of words such as \"parties can, if they so desire, refer their disputes to arbitration\" or \"in the event of any dispute, the parties may also agree to refer the same to arbitration\" or \"if any disputes arise between the parties, they should consider settlement by arbitration\" in a clause relating to settlement of disputes, indicate that the clause is not intended to be an arbitration agreement.  Similarly, a clause which states that \"if the parties so decide, the disputes shall be referred to arbitration\" or \"any disputes between parties, if they so agree, shall be referred to arbitration, is not an arbitration agreement.  Such clauses merely indicate a desire or hope to have the disputes settled by arbitration, or a tentative arrangement to explore arbitration as a mode of settlement if and when a dispute arises.  Such clauses require the parties to arrive at a further agreement to go to arbitration, as and when the disputes arise.  Any agreement or clause in an agreement requiring or contemplating a further consent or consensus before a reference to arbitration, is not an arbitration agreement, but an agreement to enter into an arbitration agreement in future.

But, the question would be different where the entire contract containing the arbitration agreement stands vitiated by reason of fraud of this magnitude. It may be noticed that Part II of the 1996 Act contains a provision for approaching the court. Section 45 of the 1996 Act contains a non-obstante clause. A judicial authority, therefore, may entertain an application at the instance of a party which alleges that there exists an arbitration agreement whereupon judicial authority may refer the parties to arbitration, save and except in a case where it finds that the said agreement is null and void, inoperative and incapable of being performed. Section 8 of the 1996 Act, however, is differently worded. Thus, as and when a question in regard to the validity or otherwise of the arbitration agreement arises, a judicial authority would have the jurisdiction under certain circumstances to go into the said question.

For any order under section 9 of the Act of 1996, the court must have jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject matter of the arbitration if the same had been the subject matter of the suit. The pecularity of the admiralty action in rem is that the coastal authorities in respect of any maritime claim can assume jurisdiction by arrest of the ship, irrespective of the nationality of the ship or that of its owners, or place of business or dismissal or residence of its owners or the place where the cause of action arose wholly or in part. In admiralty, the vessel has a juridical personality. Admiralty law confers upon the claimant right in rem to proceed against the ship or cargo as distinguished from a right in personam to proceed against the owner. A ship may be arrested: (i) to acquire jurisdiction; (ii) to obtain security for satisfaction of the claim when decreed or (iii) in execution of the decree. Section 9(ii)(b) of Act of 1996 cannot be construed so as to read into it in rem jurisdiction. This provision does not cover the arrest of the ship or the keeping of a ship under arrest in the exercise of the court jurisdiction in rem at all.

It is only on accepting the terms of the purchase order would a contract come into being.  Clause 1 of the purchase order does provide that execution of this order shall be deemed to be acceptance of the conditions stated hereinabove.  Clause 11 of the Purchase Order provided that the respondents could draw attention of the Company to conditions which they find unacceptable.  By the terms contained in the delivery challan the petitioner company is deemed to have been informed that the condition that their decision was final was not acceptable and that the dispute if any should be referred to arbitration of the Bharat Chamber of Commerce.  As such even though the purchase order was received, the respondents did not accept the purchase order and drew the attention of the Company that the term of resolving the dispute was not acceptable by sending the goods under delivery challan which contained clauses 4 and 7.  Clause 4 made it clear, that it is in the nature of counter offer by the Respondents to the petitioners for accepting the goods.  In other words the Respondents had not agreed to clause 10 of the purchase order.  Even otherwise considering clause 11 the respondent had specifically informed the petitioners that they were sending the goods under the delivery challan with a different condition.  The petitioners accepted the goods under the challan without protest.  As such pursuant to the counter offer or counter proposal the terms of the delivery stood amended even considering clause 11 of the purchase order and accordingly the contract apart from the terms and conditions of the purchase order which were agreed by the parties would contain additional terms under which the goods were despatched and accepted by the petitioners.  The petitioners also sent invoices.  Under the invoices again there was an arbitral clause.  The invoices were accepted, moneys paid under the invoices without protest.  To my mind, therefore, the contract between the parties clearly contemplated a provision for arbitration.  1999(2) ALL MR 310 - Referred to.\t [Para 3]"

In other words, the award must contain reasons.  It would therefore be a requirement of law that mere giving of reasons would not meet with the requirement of Section 31(3), but the reasons must be based on the material available to the tribunal.  The tribunal has to give its reasons,  on consideration of the relevant material and ignoring irrelevant material.  This would be the relevant test.  Findings based on the reasons not considering material on record and/or on appreciation of the evidence which the Court finds to be totally perverse can be said to be not a reasoned award.  [Para 10]\n\nThe purpose of giving reasons is to enable the Court to know that the Arbitrator has correctly addressed himself to the controversy in issue or has considered the material on record or ignored irrelevant material or applied the correct principles and, thereafter, on appreciation of the evidence has given reasons for the findings on the conclusions.  This, to my mind, would be the requirement of giving reasons. Any other manner of reading the expression to give reasons would defeat the mandate of law as contained in Section 31(3) of Act of 1996. Parliament, under the Act of 1996, has mandated the Tribunal to give reasons unless the parties themselves agree that no reasons can be given.  Therefore, every award will have to satisfy these tests.  If these tests are satisfied, then the Court would not interfere, otherwise, it would be open to the Court under the Act of 1996 to interfere with the award on the ground that the Arbitrator has failed to comply with the mandatory requirement of Section 31(3) and/or alternatively holding that the award based on no reasons is a nullity at law. What is nullity in law would fall under the expression the public policy of this country and, consequently, Section 34(2)(b) of the Act 1996 would be attracted and would mandate the Court interfering with the award.

If so, the arbitral tribunal would have been improperly constituted and be without jurisdiction. It would then be open to the aggrieved party to require, the arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction. Section 16 provides for this. It states that the arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction. That the arbitral tribunal may rule \"on any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the arbitration agreement\" shows that the arbitral tribunal's authority under Section 16 is not confined to the width of Its jurisdiction, as was submitted by learned counsel for the appellants, but goes to the very root of its jurisdiction. There would, therefore, be no impediment in contending before the arbitral tribunal that it had been wrongly constituted by reason of the fact that the Chief Justice or his designate had nominated an arbitrator although the period of thirty days had not expired and that, therefore. It had no jurisdiction.\t\t\t\t [Para 21]"

The concern of the Court is to ensure neutrality, impartiality and independence of the third arbitrator.

It is true that even at the stage of exercising its jurisdiction under Section 11(6) at the final stage, the Chief Justice of India or his nominee can informally enquire about the preference of the parties. But it is entirely upto the Chief Justice of India, whether to accept any of the preferences or to appoint the third arbitrator not mentioned by any of the parties. In making such a choice, the Chief Justice of India will be guided by the relevant provisions contained in the Arbitration Act, UNCITRAL Model Laws and the UNCITRAL Rules, where the parties have included the applicability of the UNCITRAL Model Laws/UNCITRAL Rules by choice.

The Arbitration Act emphasises that an arbitration clause which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of the other terms of the contract. It further provides that a decision by the Arbitral Tribunal that the contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause.\n\n(2003) 6 SCC 503 Rel. on.      [Para 22]\n\nThe concept of separability of the arbitration clause/agreement from the underlying contract has been statutorily recognised by this country under Section 16 of the Arbitration Act, 1996. Having provided for resolution of disputes through arbitration, parties can not be permitted to avoid arbitration, without satisfying the Court that it will be just and in the interest of all the parties not to proceed with the arbitration. Section 5 of the Arbitration Act provides that the Court shall not intervene in the arbitration process except in accordance with the provisions contained in Part I of the Arbitration Act. This policy of least interference in arbitration proceedings recognises the general principle that the function of Courts in matters relating to arbitration is to support arbitration process. A conjoint reading of Section 5 and Section 16 would make it clear that all matters including the issue as to whether the main contract was void/voidable can be referred to arbitration. Otherwise, it would be a handy tool available to the unscrupulous parties to avoid arbitration, by raising the bogey of the underlying contract being void.\n\n2010 ALL SCR 83 Overruled.      [Para 26]\n\nThe Court ought to act with caution and circumspection whilst examining the plea that the main contract is void or voidable. The Court ought to decline reference to arbitration only where the Court can reach the conclusion that the contract is void on a meaningful reading of the contract document itself without the requirement of any further proof.      [Para 29]\n\nThe defence of the contract being void is now-a-days taken routinely along with the other usual grounds, to avoid/delay reference to arbitration. In my opinion, such ground needs to be summarily rejected unless there is clear indication that the defence has a reasonable chance of success.      [Para 31]"

Any laxity in that behalf might lend itself and perhaps justify the legitimate criticism that government failed to provide against possible prejudice to public interest. The change in the legal approach towards arbitration as an Alternative Dispute Resolution Mechanism is perceptible both in regard to the requirement of giving reasons and the scope of interference by the Court with arbitral awards. While in regard to requirement of giving reasons the law has brought in dimensions not found under the old Act, the scope of interference appears to be shrinking in its amplitude, no matter judicial pronouncements at time appear to be heading towards a more expansive approach, that may appear to some to be opening up areas for judicial review on newer grounds falling under the caption \"Public Policy\" appearing in Section 34 of the Act. It is one of the well known canons of interpretation of statues that when an earlier enactment is truly ambiguous in that it is equally open to diverse meanings, the later enactment may in certain circumstances serve as the parliamentary exposition of the former.

Secondly, in a suit a person aggrieved by a decree can prefer an Appeal. A person however cannot prefer an Appeal or file a petition aggrieved by findings. It is also settled law that such findings would not be bringing on the party in subsequent proceedings and/or constitute res judicata. The purpose behind it is, that the party who had no opportunity of contesting the said findings cannot be precluded from contesting the legality of the said findings. If such findings are sought to be used in collateral proceedings.  It is always open to the Court in such an event to consider the said findings. In the instant case these are not mere findings.  It is a proposition of law namely interpretation  of Section.  It is not merely a conclusion of law.  A mere conclusion of law could not have been interfered with by this court in a challenge to the Award, but if it is proposition of law based on the interpretation of the Act the Court can interfere with the same.  Also the proposition of law was not referred to the learned Arbitrator for decision.  It arose incidentally.  In the instant case, however, what is sought to be contended is that on account of the subsequent notification the Award should not be enforced.  What this Court is therefore,  called upon is to give an interpretation to the law subsequent to the Notification dated 30th September, 1998.  It is always open to the Court, therefore, in considering the contention as raised by the petitioners to decide the said proposition of law. In the instant case it is so done.  It was contended at one Stage that these are contentions which can be raised at the stage of execution.  The challenges to an award are as contained in Section 34 of the Arbitration Act, 1996.  If a challenge is not available under Section  34 it cannot be available to an executing Court.  On the contrary, the challenges before the executing Court are further limited to jurisdictional issues only."

Sikri, J. :- A mere allegation of fraud in the pleadings by one party against the other cannot be a ground to hold that the matter is incapable of settlement by arbitration and should be decided by the civil court. The allegations of fraud should be such that not only these allegations are serious that in normal course these may even constitute criminal offence, they are also complex in nature and the decision on these issues demand extensive evidence for which civil court should appear to be more appropriate forum than the Arbitral Tribunal. Otherwise, it may become a convenient mode of avoiding the process of arbitration by simply using the device of making allegations of fraud and pleading that issue of fraud needs to be decided by the civil court. The judgment in N. Radhakrishnan 2010 ALL SCR 83 (which held that allegations of fraud cannot be adjudicated upon by the arbitral tribunal), does not touch upon this aspect and said decision is rendered after finding that allegations of fraud were of serious nature. 2010 ALL SCR 83, 2014 ALL SCR 2672, AIR 1962 SC 406, 2011(7) ALL MR 786 (S.C.)

It, thus, follows that those cases where there are serious allegations of fraud, they are to be treated as non-arbitrable and it is only the civil court which should decide such matters. However, where there are allegations of fraud simplicitor and such allegations are merely alleged, it may not be necessary to nullify the effect of the arbitration agreement between the parties as such issues can be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal. \t                [Para 18]\n\nDr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J. :- The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 does not in specific terms exclude any category of disputes - civil or commercial - from arbitrability. Intrinsic legislative material is in fact to the contrary. Section 8 contains a positive mandate and obligates the judicial authority to refer parties to arbitration in terms of the arbitration agreement. While dispensing with the element of judicial discretion, the statute imposes an affirmative obligation on every judicial authority to hold down parties to the terms of the agreement entered into between them to refer disputes to arbitration. Article 8 of the UNCITRAL Model Law enabled a court to decline to refer parties to arbitration if it is found that the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. Section 8 of the Act of 1996 has made a departure which is indicative of the wide reach and ambit of the statutory mandate. Section 8 uses the expansive expression \"judicial authority\" rather than \"court\" and the words \"unless it finds that the agreement is null and void, inoperative and incapable of being performed\" do not find place in Section 8.\t [Para 26]\n\nSection 16 empowers the arbitral tribunal to rule upon its own jurisdiction, including ruling on any objection with respect to the existence or validity of an arbitration agreement. Section 16(1)(b) stipulates that a decision by the arbitral tribunal that a contract is null and void shall not entail ipso jure the invalidity of the arbitration clause. Hence, the invalidity of the contract between the parties does not render the arbitration agreement invalid as a consequence of law. This recognises as inhering in the arbitrator the jurisdiction to consider whether the main contract (other than the arbitration clause) is null and void. It leaves the adjudicatory power of the arbitral tribunal unaffected, over any objection that the main contract between the parties is affected by fraud or undue influence.\t [Para 27]\n\nHence, allegations of criminal wrongdoing or of statutory violation would not detract from the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal to resolve a dispute arising out of a civil or contractual relationship on the basis of the jurisdiction conferred by the arbitration agreement.\n\nThe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, should be interpreted so as to bring in line the principles underlying its interpretation in a manner that is consistent with prevailing approaches in the common law world. Jurisprudence in India must evolve towards strengthening the institutional efficacy of arbitration. Deference to a forum chosen by parties as a complete remedy for resolving all their claims is but part of that evolution. Minimising the intervention of courts is again a recognition of the same principle.   [Para 35,43]"

Sikri, J. :- While dealing with such an issue in an application under Section 8 of the Act, the focus of the Court has to be on the question as to whether jurisdiction of the Court has been ousted instead of focusing on the issue as to whether the Court has jurisdiction or not. It has to be kept in mind that insofar as the statutory scheme of the Act is concerned, it does not specifically exclude any category of cases as non-arbitrable. Such categories of non-arbitrable subjects are carved out by the Courts, keeping in mind the principle of common law that certain disputes which are of public nature, etc. are not capable of adjudication and settlement by arbitration and for resolution of such disputes, Courts, i.e. public fora, are better suited than a private forum of arbitration. Therefore, the inquiry of the Court, while dealing with an application under Section 8 of the Act, should be on the aforesaid aspect, viz. whether the nature of dispute is such that it cannot be referred to arbitration, even if there is an arbitration agreement between the parties. When the case of fraud is set up by one of the parties and on that basis that party wants to wriggle out of that arbitration agreement, a strict and meticulous inquiry into the allegations of fraud is needed and only when the Court is satisfied that the allegations are of serious and complicated nature that it would be more appropriate for the Court to deal with the subject matter rather than relegating the parties to arbitration, then alone such an application under Section 8 should be rejected.\t [Para 20]\n\nDr. D.Y. Chandrachud, J. :- The burden must lie heavily on a party which avoids compliance with the obligation assumed by it to submit disputes to arbitration to establish the dispute is not arbitrable under the law for the time being in force. In each such case where an objection on the ground of fraud and criminal wrongdoing is raised, it is for the judicial authority to carefully sift through the materials for the purpose of determining whether the defence is merely a pretext to avoid arbitration. It is only where there is a serious issue of fraud involving criminal wrongdoing that the exception to arbitrability carved out in N. Radhakrishnan (2010) 1 SCC 72, may come into existence. Allegations of fraud are not alien to ordinary civil courts. Generations of judges have dealt with such allegations in the context of civil and commercial disputes. If an allegation of fraud can be adjudicated upon in the course of a trial before an ordinary civil court, there is no reason or justification to exclude such disputes from the ambit and purview of a claim in arbitration. Parties who enter into commercial dealings and agree to a resolution of disputes by an arbitral forum exercise an option and express a choice of a preferred mode for the resolution of their disputes. Parties in choosing arbitration place priority upon the speed, flexibility and expertise inherent in arbitral adjudication. Once parties have agreed to refer disputes to arbitration, the court must plainly discourage and discountenance litigative strategies designed to avoid recourse to arbitration. Any other approach would seriously place in uncertainty the institutional efficacy of arbitration. Such a consequence must be eschewed.\t [Para 37]"

The last mentioned requirement can be dispensed with if the parties have agreed that no reasons are to be given or the award is made on the agreed terms of settlement between the parties u/s. 30. In the instant case both these situations do not exist. Therefore, there is no dispute of the fact that it was obligatory on the part of the arbitral tribunal to have given the reasons. It is important to note that all the above mentioned four requirements are mandatory.\t\t\t\t\t [Para 4]\n\nThe court has thus a minimum supervisory role of intervention in the matters of arbitration. This being the position of an award there is a great responsibility upon the arbitrator to act with a sense of impartiality and conduct the proceedings with utmost fairness. The parties having agreed to abide by the arbitral award, repose confidence in the arbitrator. Therefore, unless it is otherwise agreed, it is a right of the parties to know the reasons upon which the award is based. The reasons given by the arbitrator may not be adequate or fully convincing. They cannot be put to judicial scrutiny like the reasons given by a trial court are subjected to scrutiny in appeal. Therefore, it is absolutely essential that an arbitral award, where there is no agreement to the contrary, must contain reasons which are indicative of the fact as to how the arbitrator has arrived at his conclusion. An award is not a judgment in the strict sense of the term. But after all it is an adjudication of the dispute between the parties. It is a solemn document which determines the rights and liabilities of the parties with reference to the dispute referred to the arbitral tribunal and carries sanctity since after a specified period it becomes final and binding on the parties and can also be enforced as if it were a decree.\n\n1997(4) SCC 121.\t\t\t [Para 5]"

(i) the composition of the arbitral tribunal was not in accordance with the agreement between the parties or (ii) the arbitral procedure was not in accordance with the agreement between the parties or (iii) in the absence of such an agreement, the composition of the arbitral tribunal or arbitral procedure was not in accordance with part I of the Act, 1996.  It is, therefore, obvious that want of reasons is not a ground contemplated by clause (v).  In fact none of the clauses of S.34 contemplates such a ground and the reason for the same, is that an adjudication of dispute without giving any reason upon which it is based is not an award at all.

Section 34(3) is a limitation provision, which is an inbuilt into the remedy provision. One does not have to look at the Limitation Act or any other provision for identifying the limitation period for challenging an Award passed under Part I of the Arbitration Act.\n\n(b) \tThe time limit for commencement of limitation period is also provided in Section 34(3) i.e. the time from which a party making an application \"had received the Arbitral Award\" or disposal of a request under Section 33 for corrections and interpretation of the Award.\n\n(c) \tSection 34(3) prohibits the filing of an application for setting aside of an Award after three months have elapsed from the date of receipt of Award or disposal of a request under Section 33. Section 34(3) uses the phrase \"an application for setting aside may not be made after three months have elapsed\". The phrase \"may not be made\" is from the UNCITRAL Model Law and has been understood to mean \"cannot be made\".\n\n(d) \tThe limitation provision in Section 34(3) also provides for condonation of delay. Unlike Section 5 of Limitation Act, the delay can only be condoned for 30 days on showing sufficient cause. The crucial phrase \"but not thereafter\" reveals the legislative intent to fix an outer boundary period for challenging an Award.\n\n(e) \tOnce the time limit or extended time limit for challenging the arbitral award expires, the period for enforcing the award under Section 36 of the Arbitration Act commences. This is evident from the phrase \"where the time for making an application to set aside the arbitral award under Section 34 has expired\". There is an integral nexus between the period prescribed under Section 34(3) to challenge the Award and the commencement of the enforcement period under Section 36 to execute the Award.\t\n\n\tIf Section 17 of the Limitation Act were to be applied to determining the limitation period under Section 34(3), it would have the following consequences :-\n\n(a) \tIn Section 34(3), the commencement period for computing limitation is the date of receipt of award or the date of disposal of request under Section 33 (i.e correction/additional award).\n\n\tIf Section 17 were to be applied for computing the limitation period under Section 34(3), the starting period of limitation would be the date of discovery of the alleged fraud or mistake. The starting point for limitation under Section 34(3) would be different from the Limitation Act.\n\n(b) \tThe proviso to Section 34(3) enables a Court to entertain an application to challenge an Award after the three months period is expired, but only within an additional period of thirty dates, \"but not thereafter\". The use of the phrase \"but not thereafter\" shows that the 120 days period is the outer boundary for challenging an Award. If Section 17 were to be applied, the outer boundary for challenging an Award could go beyond 120 days. The phrase \"but not thereafter\" would be rendered redundant and otiose. This Court has consistently taken this view that the words \"but not thereafter\" in the proviso of Section 34 (3) of the Arbitration Act are of a mandatory nature, and couched in negative terms, which leaves no room for doubt.\t  [Para 35]\n\n\tIn view of, the aforesaid inconsistencies with the language of Section 34(3) of Arbitration Act tantamount to an \"express exclusion\" of Section 17 of Limitation Act.\n\n2010 ALL SCR 2248, 2012 ALL SCR 969, 2018 ALL SCR 1054 Ref. to  [Para 36]"

Foundation of exercising jurisdiction for grant of relief is therefore, based on the facts that the Award passed has taken into consideration the substantive law of India which will include the byelaws of the Stock Exchange.  Byelaws framed by the Bombay Stock Exchange have been held to be an exercise in subordinate legislation.  It would therefore, be law.  If the Award is passed without considering the substantive law, then it would be arbitrary.  The jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal to pass an award would only be in the event the contract entered into was a valid contract.  Considering byelaw 354 of the byelaws, the contract entered into in contravention of the said byelaws is void.  The arbitrator therefore, had no jurisdiction to pass the Award based on the void contract or in passing the award has acted arbitrarily.  See Steel Authority of India Ltd. Vs. J.C. Budharaja, Government and Mining Contractor (1999) 8 SCC 122.  Though that Judgment was decided under the Act of 1940, the same principles would apply.  An award based on a contract which is void would be arbitrary.  An award without jurisdiction or an award which is arbitrary, would be contrary to the public policy of India and consequently be covered by Sec. 34(b)(ii).\t [Para 5]"

B. Sinha, J. for himself and on behalf of V. N. Khare CJI.) Section 21 of the 1996 Act, provides as to when the arbitral proceedings would be deemed to have commenced. Section 21 although may be construed to be laying down a provision for the purpose of the said Act but the same must be given its full effect having regard to the fact that the repeal and saving clause is also contained therein. Section 21 of the Act must, therefore, be construed having regard to Section 85(2)(a) of the 1996 Act. Once it is so construed, indisputably the service of notice and/ or issuance of request for appointment of an arbitrator in terms of the arbitration agreement must be held to be determinative of the commencement of the arbitral proceeding.   [Para 50]\n\nSection 85 of the 1996 Act repeals the 1940 Act. Sub-section (2) of Section 85 provides for a non-obstante clause. Clause (a) of the said sub-section provides for saving clause stating that the provisions of the said enactments shall apply in relation to arbitral proceedings which commenced before the said Act came into force. Thus, those arbitral proceedings which were commenced before coming into force of the 1996 Act are saved and the provisions of the 1996 Act would not apply in relation to arbitral proceedings which commenced on or after the said Act came into force. Even for the said limited purpose, it is necessary to find out as to what is meant by commencement of arbitral proceedings for the purpose of the 1996 Act wherefor also necessity of reference to Section 21 would arise. The court is to interpret the repeal and savings clauses in such a manner so as to give a pragmatic and purposive meaning thereto. It is one thing to say that commencement of arbitration proceedings' is dependent upon the fact of each case as that would be subject to the agreement between the parties. It is also another thing to say that the expression 'commencement of arbitration proceedings must be understood having regard to the context in which the same is used, but it would be a totally different thing to say that the arbitration proceedings commences only for the purpose of limitation upon issuance of a notice and for no other purpose. The statute does not say so. Even the case laws do not suggest the same. On the contrary the decisions of this Court operating in the field beginning from Shetty Construction (supra) are ad idem to the effect that Section 21 must be taken recourse to for the purpose of interpretation of Section 85(2)(a) of the Act. There is no reason, even if two views are possible to make a departure from the decisions of this Apex Court. While interpreting a judgment this Court must pin point its attention to the ratio thereof. A court of law must not lose sight of the doctrine of 'stare decisis'. A view which has been holding the field for a long time should not be disturbed only because another view is possible.   [Para 71,72]\n\nHence in this case also, service of a notice for appointment of an arbitrator would be the relevant date for the purpose of commencement of the arbitration proceeding.   [Para 73]\n\nMinority view (Per Kapadia, J.):-  In the present matter, one is concerned with transitional provision, i.e. Section 85(2)(a) which enacts as to how the statute will operate on the facts and circumstances existing on the date it comes into force and, therefore, the construction of such a provision must depend upon its own terms and not on the basis of section 21. There is a material difference between section 48 of the 1940 Act, which emphasized the concept of \"reference\" vis-a-vis Section 85(2)(a) of the 1996 Act which emphasizes the concept of \"commencement\"; there is a material difference in the scheme of two Acts; that the expression \"in relation to\" appearing in Section 85(2)(a) refers to different stages of arbitration proceedings under the old Act; and lastly that Section 85(2)(a) provides for limited repeal of the 1940 Act, therefore, one cannot confine the concept of 'commencement' under Section 85(2)(a) only to Section 21 of the 1996 Act which inter alia provides for commencement of arbitral proceedings from the date on which a request to refer a particular dispute is received by the respondent.  [Para 106]\n\nThe point to be noted is that while construing section 85(2) of the 1996 Act, which is a transitional provision, the terms of the arbitration clause and the conduct of the parties were taken into account. Therefore, interpretation of section 85(2)(a) cannot be confined to section 21 of the 1996 Act. However, in cases where the new Act is applicable one has to go by section 21 and in which case arbitration proceedings will commence from the date when request is received by the respondent for referring the dispute to arbitration, unless the parties have agreed to the contrary.

The Act has radically altered the situation. The 1996 Act is intended to consolidate and amend the law relating to domestic arbitration, international commercial arbitration and enforcement of foreign arbitral awards as also to define the law, inter alia, as indicated in the preamble. Consequently, the Act has permitted very limited scope of challenge to an arbitral award. Section 34(1) provides that an arbitral award may be challenged only by an application for setting aside such award in accordance with subsection (2) and (3). Subsections (2) and (3) of Section 34 provide that an arbitral award may be set aside only on the grounds narrated in subsection (2). Finally, subsection (3) provides that such an application for setting aside an award may not be made after three months have elapsed from the date on which the party making that application had received the arbitral award, or if a request had been made under section 33, from the date on which the said request had been disposed of by the arbitral tribunal. Thus there is extremely narrow power of condonation of delay vested in the Court by the proviso. The proviso empowers the Court, if satisfied that the applicant was prevented by sufficient cause from making the application within the period of three months, to entertain the application \"within a further period of 30 days, but not thereafter\".\t\t\t [Para 15]\n\nThe last three words of the Proviso indicate that whatever might have been the position in law earlier, after the coming into force of the 1996 Act, after expiry of the period of three months and 30 days, the Court has no power to condone the delay in the presentation of the petition.\t\t\t [Para 16]"

It is ultimately the operative award which is executed under section 36 of the Act and when section 31(1) states that the award shall be made in writing and shall be signed by the members of the Arbitral Tribunal, it is the document signed by all the three of them which will have to be construed as the award of the Arbitral Tribunal and not the one signed by two or one who is dissenting.  Section 31(2) provides for an exceptional situation, that is where the signature of a member of the Tribunal for some reason or the other is not available.  This in fact supports what is provided under section 31(1), namely that the final award is a document which is signed by all the members of the Tribunal.  The challenge to the reasoned judgment singed by only two of them cannot be a substitute to a challenge to the final operative award.  In the present case, we clearly have three documents on record; one signed by two of the judges which is a majority award, one signed by the dissenting judge and thereafter the final operative award signed by all three of them which specifically states that \"for reasons recorded by them separately in the majority judgment\", they were making the operative award.  Inasmuch as that award was not challenged before the learned Single Judge, there was no challenge to the operative award as such and therefore there was no reason for the learned Single Judge to go into any other aspects of the matter.  The act being an act passed to give sanctity to the arbitral proceedings, unless there is a challenge to the final operative award, a challenge to the reasoned award signed only by the majority members cannot be construed as a challenge to the final award under the garb of a liberal interpretation.

But the Court need not go as far as to hold that the view which has been formed by the Learned Arbitrator on the basis of the correspondence is the only correct view in order to sustain the award. The Arbitrator was entitled to rule on his own jurisdiction under sub-section (1) of Section 16 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. Undoubtedly, the decision of the Arbitrator on a question relating to his jurisdiction cannot be conclusive for, Section 32(2)(a)(iv) contemplates a challenge to an arbitral award inter alia if the award deals with a dispute not contemplated by or not falling within the terms of the submission to arbitration or on the ground that it contains decisions on matters beyond the scope of the submission to arbitration.

They are often required by Arbitrator or submitted by the parties voluntarily for the sake of convenience.  Merely because a written submission is not served in advance on the other side, it would not be possible to infer that there is denial of equal treatment to the parties who are required to be given a full opportunity to present their case.  Moreover, section 18 requires the Arbitrator to treat the party with equality.  If one party does not submit its written submission to the other party in advance, it could hardly be said to be a lapse on the part of the Arbitrator.  There is, therefore, no merit in the contention that section 18 of the Act has been violated and, therefore, the award is liable to be set aside under section 34(2)(a)(v) which enables the Court to set aside an award on that ground.\t\t\t\t [Para 16]"

The learned Arbitrator has made an Award in favour of the claimants and against the Petitioners for an amount of Rs.25 lacs with interest at the rate of 18% per annum right from 13/12/1996.  The findings that have been recorded by the learned Arbitrator are shocking.  Sweeping observations are made in the Award for which there is no material available on record.  On the contrary, the material available on record shows exactly the opposite position.  The Arbitrator was under a duty to properly appreciate the material on record specially because the claim was against a public authority and the amounts were claimed from public funds.  Allowing the work to such a huge extent being allotted to contractors, without inviting tenders, is contrary to the fundamental policy of India which is enshrined in Article 14 of the Constitution.  It appears that the learned Arbitrator has also visited the site to find out whether any evidence of dismantling of the additional work is available.  There does not appear to be much dispute about the fact that a part of the work carried out by the Respondents was dismantled.  When the witness for the Respondents was examined, he stated that presently, no evidence of dismantling is present but surprisingly, the learned Arbitrator has found that there is evidence of dismantling available at the site.  However, site inspection is not of much importance for considering the validity of the Award.  Taking an overall view of the matter, looking from any point of view, the Award made by the learned Arbitrator cannot be allowed to stand and has to be set aside.  [Para 20]"

The power under Sub section (4) is given to the court to make an order of reference firstly to the arbitrator appointed by the parties whether in the agreement or otherwise, and only in the event the parties cannot agree then to appoint an arbitrator.  Power has been statutorily conferred.  The power therefore, is statutory.  These sections therefore, specifically provide that the court has powers to appoint a person as arbitrator only on failure as set out therein.  The failure is when they can not agree.\t [Para 5]\n\nIn the instant case, the power to secure appointment is of the Chief Justice or his designate.  The Chief Justice or the designate does not decide the right of the parties but only secures an appointment.  There is no power under Section 11 of the Act of 1996, as for example under Section 8(b) of the Arbitration Act 1940.  The power under Section 11 is a measure to secure appointment of the arbitrator in the course of exercising administrative powers.  That can only be to give effect to the contract or in the event the contract cannot be given effect to then to give effect to arbitral clause by nominating arbitrator so as to enable the parties to go to the forum of their choice.  There is nothing to indicate that the Chief Justice or his designate, where the clause provides for arbitral procedure for nominating arbitrator even in case of failure to make nomination, can completely give a go bye to the arbitral clause and appoint another person as arbitrator even when the person or authority named is available.  In the first instance, it would be to give effect to the agreement between the parties.  An administrative authority does not displace the terms of the contract unless power is conferred by statute and it is expressly required to be dealt.  Otherwise, the administrative authority can only give effect to the provisions of the contract, by directing the parties to arbitration in the manner provided.  The manner provided normally should be by securing the appointment in terms of the contract between the parties.  Where the terms of the agreement do not provide for securing the nomination as per explanation under Section 11(6)(3) and 11(6)(c), then to secure the nomination under section 11(6)(c), to secure nomination by normally directing the named authority to secure the appointment within a time frame failing which to make the appointment.

The foreign award, therefore, contains an adjudication over the differences between the persons arising out of the legal relationships, considered as commercial under the law in force in India. The \"legal relationships\" contemplated must contain in the agreement in writing for arbitration in accordance with the Convention set forth in the First Schedule.\n\n\tClause 1 under Article II of the First Schedule states that each Contracting State shall recognise an agreement in writing under which the parties undertake to submit to arbitration all or any differences which have arisen or which may arise between them in respect of defined legal relationship, whether contractual or not, concerning a subject-matter capable of settlement by arbitration. Clause 2 therein states that the term \"agreement in writing\" shall include an arbitral clause in a contract or an arbitration agreement, signed by the parties or contained in an exchange of letters or telegrams. Thus, the existence of the defined legal relationship in writing, undertaking to submit to arbitration all or any differences concerning a subject-matter capable of settlement by arbitration, is the sine qua non to constitute a \"foreign award\", as defined under Section 44 of the said Act.\t\t [Para 14,15,16]"

                ],
                "description": "Arbitration agreement - Doctrine of severability - Even if arbitral clause is invalid, the jurisdiction to decide that is of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\nWhere a contract provides for arbitration of disputes which arise thereunder, does the invalidity, termination, nullification or suspension of the contract vitiate the arbitral obligations of the parties?  The question is posed on the assumption that when the agreement contains an obligation to arbitrate the disputes arising from it but the agreement is invalid or no longer in force, the obligation to arbitrate disappears with the agreement of which it is a part.  If the agreement was never entered at all, then the arbitral clause never came into force.  If the agreement was not validly entered into, then, prima facie, it is invalid as a whole, as must be all of its parts, including its arbitral clause.  If the agreement has been nullified or terminated, - or, arguably suspended it must presumably follow that the obligation to arbitrate disputes arising under the agreement is nullified, terminated or suspended.  Now if, in these various contingencies, there is no initial or sustained obligation to arbitrate under an agreement which either never came into force or is no longer in force, then the arbitral tribunal which may be or is constituted pursuant to the arbitral clause of the void or voided agreement has no standing to do anything.  It cannot pronounce or decide upon the validity of the agreement or upon the effect of the tribunal's establishment or upon its jurisdiction or upon the merits of the case because it cannot have a legal status which derives from a vacuum. This proposition of law has been overcomed by presumption and by practice.  It has been overcomed by necessity.  It has been overcomed by the essence of the arbitral process.  If it is inherent in the arbitral process that a tribunal is the judge of its own jurisdiction, that it has competence de la competence, it is no less inherent in that process that an arbitral tribunal shall have the competence to pass upon disputes arising out of the agreement which is the immediate source of the tribunal's creation even where those disputes engage the initial or continuing validity of that agreement.  This essential doctrine of modern arbitration is called that of the severability, separability or autonomy of the arbitration agreement.  The rational of the doctrine of the severability of the arbitration agreement has four foundations as set out by Justice S.M. Schwebel.  Firstly, when two parties enter into a contract or a treaty providing for arbitration of disputes arising thereunder, and do so as they typically do in comprehensive terms - \"any dispute arising out of or relating to the agreement\" they intend to require arbitration of any dispute not otherwise settled, including disputes over the validity of the contract or treaty, then the will of the parties should be given effect to.  Secondly, if one party could deny arbitration to the other party by the allegation that the agreement lacked initial or continuing validity, if by such an allegation it could deprive an arbitral tribunal of the competence to rule upon that allegation, upon its constitution and jurisdiction and upon the merits of the dispute, then it would always be open to a party to an agreement containing an arbitration clause to vitiate its arbitral obligation by the simple expedient of declaring the agreement void.  The intention of the parties and the requirements of effective arbitration combine to give rise to the concept of severability.  Thirdly, in reality, or, if not in reality, then in the contemplation of the law and as a matter of legal presumption, the parties to an agreement containing an arbitration clause conclude not one agreement but two; first, the substantive or principal agreement, which provides for a certain course of action; second, an additional, separable agreement which provides for arbitration of disputes arising out of the principal agreement.  Even if it be argued, or even if it be authoritatively decided, that the principal agreement is invalid, or voided, nullified, terminated, or suspended, nevertheless the arbitral agreement is separable and separated, and, so separated, survives to furnish a viable basis for the arbitration tribunal to rule upon such agreements or arrive at those or other determinations.  Thus when the parties to an agreement containing an arbitration clause, enter into that agreement, they conclude not one but two agreements, the arbitral twin of which survives any birth defect or acquired disability of the principal agreement.  Fourthly, the consideration which militates in favour of the rule of the severability of the arbitral clause because, if severability were not the rule, the courts would, contrary to the norm, be drawn into passing upon the substance of the dispute submitted to arbitration.\t [Para 8]\n\nBoth under English Law as well as Indian law, there is no room for doubt about the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal to rule on its own jurisdiction to the exclusion of the judicial authority in India and Civil Courts of England.  The object and purpose has been earlier set out namely to facilitate International Commercial Arbitration to avoid multiplicity of proceedings and to allow one tribunal to decide all issues between the parties and further to direct the parties to proceed before the forum of their choice.  Therefore, reading Section 8 and 16 of the Indian Arbitration Act together with Section 7,9 and 30 of the English Arbitration Act, it is clear that all disputes can be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal.  The fact however, remains that if the parties acquiesce in the proceeding by not moving under Section 8 or Section 45 or section 54, the jurisdiction of the civil court will not be ousted.  At the same time the issue whether the contract is void ab initio, including the arbitral clause, inoperative or incapable of being performed, can now be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal.

When a dispute arises, however, one of the parties may nevertheless commence court proceedings, either because it challenges the validity of the arbitration agreement or because he means to breach it.  Where the court action is commenced in breach of an arbitration agreement, the other party may apply to stay the court action, unless he is content to forgo his right to refer the dispute to arbitration and to defend the action before the court. [Para 11]\n\nThe issue whether agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed, can be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal.  By the expression \"Said agreement\" what really is meant is the agreement as referred to under section 44 of the Act of 1996.  That shows that the foreign award must be made pursuant to agreement in writing for arbitration.  It is therefore, not merely the agreement but the agreement in writing for arbitration which is material.  This power in domestic arbitration to decide the validity of the arbitration agreement is conferred on the arbitral tribunal under Section 16 of the Act of 1996.  In case of an agreement providing for arbitration outside India, a specific power has been conferred on the Civil Court, in the event any party to the agreement seeks referral to arbitration to decide whether the agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.  This seems to be part of public policy to confer jurisdiction on municipal courts to decide whether the arbitral agreement is void or inoperative, then not to give effect to the arbitral clause but to get the issue decided by the Civil Court, which as a civil court it has jurisdiction to decide.  The object being that party ought not to be driven to prosecute arbitral proceedings in the foreign country at considerable time and expenses, where the finding of the court would show that the arbitral agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.  It is to avoid a situation, where all that the arbitral tribunal would have to do is to record the same finding that the arbitral agreement is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed and then close the proceedings.  To that extent in the matter of international commercial arbitration, the law has put a rider on the power of the court to direct the parties to arbitration.  In such circumstances, the Civil Court can proceed with the suit, if defendant seeks and direct the parties to arbitration.  In the instant case, defendant in the suit, respondent herein, has chosen not to take any steps.  It may also be relevant to note that there is nothing in Section 45 like Section 8 setting out at what stage the application should be made. Section 8 requires an application to be made to the judicial authority not later than submitting first statement on the substance of dispute.  There is no such limitation under Section 45.  However, this exercise is to be done at the instance of the defendant.  If the defendant chooses not to invoke the provision of Section 45, nothing will prevent the court from proceeding with the suit.  Again what will be the effect of Award and decree on the same cause, need not be decided here, as it is not in issue and can be decided in appropriate proceedings where the issue may arise.  The issue will have to be answered in the affirmative, namely that the Civil Court can proceed with the suit.  2002(3) ALL. M.R. 377 - Referred to.\t [Para 12]"

In the present case, the petitioners as well as the respondents were parties to the arbitration proceedings. The application was for enforcement of the Foreign Award in India and pending the said enforcement, the Court, after considering the merits of the contention and in view of the fact that the Award was already passed in favour of the petitioner, granted interim injunction to secure the amount and to avoid to render the Award infructuous. The parties, however, pending the proceedings itself, arrived at settlement and filed the Consent Terms. Therefore, ultimately, the parties have compromised and settled the claim after the order of injunction though passed against the respondents 1 and 2, but for the maritime claims. It also means the order of injunction though passed against the parties in personam, it had resulted into the detention of the ship. Even otherwise, whenever there is order of arrest of a ship, ultimately the owner and/or the concerned person appears to make the requisite payment and/or apply for release of the vessel by defending the claim and/or by settling the alleged maritime claim or lien etc. Ultimately, in such order of arrest ad/or attachment before judgment and/or seizure of the ship/property, the owner and/or the concerned person, takes step to make the payment and/or to settle the claim.

An arbitrator was appointed by the Supreme Court while setting aside the said award particularly in view of the fact that construction of the contract was in question. Supreme Court did not and could not retain any control over the proceedings of the arbitrator. A distinction must be borne in mind in a case where Supreme Court had no control over the proceedings and the case in which control of proceedings of the arbitrator had been retained. In the former case, having regard to the definition of the term 'court' as contained in S.2(c) of the 1940 Act, award must be filed before a court which has the requisite jurisdiction thereover. Whenever a term has been defined under a statute, the same should ordinarily be given effect to. The interpretation clause being prefaced by words 'unless there is anything repugnant in the subject and context' may in given situations lead to opine that the legislature intended a different meaning. While determining such a question, the court ordinarily again must preserve the right of a party to prefer an appeal. A right of appeal is a valuable right and unless there exist cogent reasons, a litigant should not be deprived of the same. It is a statutory right. As question of jurisdiction of a Court is involved herein, by consent of the parties also, jurisdiction cannot be assumed by Supreme Court.

The large number of sittings and charging of very high fees per sitting, with several add-ons, without any ceiling, have many a time resulted in the cost of arbitration approaching or even exceeding the amount involved in the dispute or the amount of the award. When an arbitrator is appointed by a court without indicating fees, either both parties or at least one party is at a disadvantage. It is necessary to find an urgent solution for this problem to save arbitration from the arbitration cost. Institutional arbitration has provided a solution as the Arbitrators' fees is not fixed by the Arbitrators themselves on case to case basis, but is governed by a uniform rate prescribed by the institution under whose aegis the Arbitration is held. Another solution is for the court to fix the fees at the time of appointing the arbitrator, with the consent of parties, if necessary in consultation with the arbitrator concerned. Third is for the retired Judges offering to serve as Arbitrators, to indicate their fee structure to the Registry of the respective High Court so that the parties will have the choice of selecting an Arbitrator whose fees are in their 'range' having regard to the stakes involved.

In other words there is no arbitration agreement at all. In other words, the arbitration clause in general conditions of contract was not an arbitration agreement in praesenti, during the bidding process, but a provision that was to come into existence in future, if a purchase order was placed. In this case, the dispute raised is in regard to a claim for Rs.10,61,28,000/- as damages on account of BSNL not placing a purchase order, that is loss of profit @ Rs.200/- per CKM for a quantity of 5.306 LCKM. Obviously the respondent cannot invoke the arbitration clause in regard to that dispute as the arbitration agreement was non-existent in the absence of a purchase order. [Para 15,17]\n\nThe respondent contended that BSNL has entered into a contract with it is respect of a quantity (0.536 LCKM), and as the dispute raised was whether the contract quantity should be more, the arbitration clause was in force and available. The contention has no merit. The arbitration agreement was available in regard to the contract for 0.536 LCKM. But in the absence of any purchase order in respect of 5.306 LCKM by BSNL on the respondent, respondent cannot seek recourse to the arbitration agreement contained in clause 20 of Section 3 of the bid document, in regard to a dispute relating to that quantity for which order was not placed. It is not sufficient to show that there was an arbitration agreement in regard to some contract between the parties. To constitute an arbitration agreement for the purpose of Sections 7 and 11 of the Act, two requirements should be satisfied. The first is that there should be an arbitration agreement between the parties to the dispute. The second is that it should relate to or be applicable to the dispute in regard to which appointment of Arbitrator is sought. For the foregoing reasons, in the absence of an arbitration agreement, the application under section 11 of the Act was not maintainable.   [Para 18]"

                "description": "Court - Principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district is a District Court - Does not include any other court inferior to the District Court.\n\nThe principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district for the purpose of a petition under section 34 of the Act of 1996 is a District Court and does not include any other court inferior to the District Court.  [Para 18]\n\nThe Act of 1996 is essentially based on United Nations Commissions on International Trade Law (for short \"UNCITRAL\") and various International Commercial Arbitration concepts. UNCITRAL Model Laws on International Commercial Arbitration was adopted in 1985 with a view to bring uniformity of the law of arbitral procedures and the specific needs of International Commercial Arbitration practise. The Law of Arbitration in India was earlier substantially contained in three enactments, namely, the Act of 1940, Arbitration (Protocol and Convention) Act, 1973 and the Foreign Awards (Recognition and Enforcement) Act, 1961. It was widely felt that the Act of 1940, which contains the General Law of Arbitration, has become outdated and it is against this backdrop and in view of UNCITRAL Model Laws, the Act of 1996 was introduced. This Act repeals the Act of 1940. One of the objectives of enactment of the Act of 1996 was to minimise supervisory role of the courts in an arbitral process. This object will have to be borne in mind while interpreting the term \"Court\" under section 2(e) of the Act of 1996.  [Para 8]\n\nThe principal court of original jurisdiction in a district does not include any civil court to a grade inferior to such principal civil court or any court of Small Causes. In other words, it categorically excludes civil courts of \"a grade inferior to such principal civil court\". The Parliament has, clearly, narrowed down the definition of the term \"Court\". The only condition contemplated in the definition of \"Court\" is that it should have jurisdiction to decide the questions forming the subject matter of the arbitration if the same had been the subject matter of a suit. The definition of \"Court\" in the Act of 1996, does not contemplate that such court should have jurisdiction over the subject matter of the dispute. What it means is the jurisdiction to decide \"the question forming the subject matter of the arbitration\" if the same had been the subject-matter of a suit. The pecuniary jurisdiction of a court, therefore, has no significance for the purposes of the Act of 1996. The Court, however, must have a territorial jurisdiction. The expression \"subject matter of the arbitration\", therefore, cannot be read to mean a court where the suit can be filed in respect of that cause of action and would, therefore, cover all the provisions from sections 16 to 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure. In other words, the pecuniary jurisdiction is no longer material for deciding the jurisdiction of a court being the principal court of original jurisdiction for the purpose of a petition under section 34 of the Act.\t\t [Para 9]\n\nBy using the words \"means\" and \"includes\" and the expression \"does not include\" as occurring in the definition of \"Court\" it makes the intendment of the Parliament clear. By using these words the Parliament has made the meaning of the term \"Court\" explicitly clear. When both these words are used together to define a thing, the intendment of the Parliament is to supply restricted meaning to the terms. The expression \"does not include any civil courts of a grade inferior to such principal civil court or any court of small causes\" occurring in section 2(e), further restricts the meaning of the term \"Court\" defined therein. It clearly excludes the courts inferior to the principal court of original jurisdiction. Keeping a literal meaning of the words \"inferior\" and \"grade\" in view, if the expression \"but does not include any civil court of a grade inferior to such principal court\" is read, it means no court subordinate/inferior to the principal civil court of ordinary original civil jurisdiction in a district, would be covered within the meaning of \"Court\" as defined under section 2(e) of the Act of 1996. Similarly, the word principal clearly indicates only one court being the higher in rank or chief. [Para 10,11]\n\nA plain and literal reading of all the aforesaid words/expressions/terms employed in section 2(e) clearly demonstrates the exact meaning of the term \"court\". It means the district court is the principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district and not a civil court of a grade inferior to such principal civil court. The court of Civil Judge, Senior Division may also be a civil court of original jurisdiction, but in any case it could not be termed as the principal civil court of original jurisdiction in a district.\t [Para 12]"

(For himself and on behalf of R. C. Lahoti, C.J.I., B. N. Agarwal, Arun Kumar, G. P. Mathur and A. K. Mathur, JJ.) :-  It is fundamental to our procedural jurisprudence, that the right of no person shall be affected without he being heard. This necessarily imposes an obligation on the Chief Justice to issue notice to the opposite party when he is moved under Section 11 of the Act. The notice to the opposite party cannot be considered to be merely an intimation to that party of the filing of the arbitration application and the passing of an administrative order appointing an arbitrator or an arbitral tribunal. It is really the giving of an opportunity of being heard. There have been cases where claims for appointment of an arbitrator based on an arbitration agreement are made ten or twenty years after the period of the contract has come to an end. There have been cases where the appointment of an arbitrator has been sought, after the parties had settled the accounts and the concerned party had certified that he had no further claims against the other contracting party. In other words, there have been occasions when dead claims are sought to be resurrected. There have been cases where assertions are made of the existence of arbitration agreements when, in fact, such existence is strongly disputed by the other side who appears on issuance of notice Controversies are also raised as to whether the claim that is sought to be put forward comes within the purview of the concerned arbitration clause at all. The Chief Justice has necessarily to apply his mind to these aspects before coming to a conclusion one way or the other and before proceeding to appoint an arbitrator or declining to appoint an arbitrator. Obviously, this is an adjudicatory process. An opportunity of hearing to both parties is a must. Even in administrative functions if rights are affected, rules of natural justice step in. The principles settled by Ridge Vs. Baldwin [(1963)2 All ER 66] are well known. Therefore, to the extent, Konkan Railway states that no notice need be issued to the opposite party to give him an opportunity of being heard before appointing an arbitrator, with respect, the same has to be held to be not sustainable. 2002(2) ALL MR 232 (S.C.) Overruled.\t [Para 36]\n\nPer C. K. Thakker, J.:-  As the Chief Justice is performing administrative function under sub-section (6) of Section 11 in appointing an arbitrator, there is no 'duty to act judicially' on his part, nonetheless there is 'duty to act fairly' which requires him to issue notice to the other side before taking a decision to appoint an arbitrator. Clause 7 of the scheme as stood prior to the amendment, could neither be held bad in law nor inconsistent with Section 11 of the Act. I am, therefore, in respectful agreement with the majority judgment on that point. [Para 146]"

                "description": "Recovery of loan payable with interest on demand - Limitation - Extension of by payment - When principal and interest are due, payment towards interest or principal extends period of limitation for both.\n\nA Comparison of sub-section 1 of Section 20 of the 1908 Limitation Act as amended in the year 1942 and the provisions of Section 19 of the Limitation Act, 1963 shows that the provisions are identical and therefore, the provisions of unamended Section 20 of Limitation Act, 1908 and the provisions of Section 20 after its amendment in the year 1942 becomes relevant  to consider what is the meaning to be attached to the term \"a debt\" used in Section 19 of the Limitation Act, 1963. It, thus, becomes clear that initially Section 20 made a clear distinction, so far as extension of period of limitation is concerned, between the payment made towards principal and payment made towards interest. Perusal of the provisions of sub-section 1 of Section 20 of the Limitation Act, 1908, as amended in the year 1942, shows that the distinction made between payment made towards interest and payment made towards principal was done away with. It is clear that the legislature wanted to extend the benefit of extension period of limitation when payment is made by the debtor to a creditor irrespective of whether payment is made towards principal or payment is made towards interest. But only requirement is that the date on which the part payment is made, both principal and interest should be due. In my opinion, accepting the construction suggested by the Petitioner of the term \"debt\" found in Section 19 of the Limitation Act would nullify the purpose for which the legislature effected the amendment in the provisions of sub-section 1 of Section 20 which is the provision identical to the provisions of Section 19 of the Limitation Act. In any case, in my opinion, the construction placed by the learned arbitrator on the provisions of Section 19 cannot be said to lead to injustice, on the contrary it leads to justice and convenience, and therefore, in my opinion, so far as the award made by the learned arbitrator in this regard is concerned, it cannot be disturbed.\t\t\t\t  [Para 17]"

No part of a term or clause should be considered as a meaningless surplusage, when it is in consonance with the other parts of the clause and expresses the specific intention of parties. When read normally, the arbitration clause makes it clear that the matter in dispute shall be referred to and finally resolved by arbitration in accordance with the provisions of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (or any statutory) modification, enactment or amendment thereof) and the venue of arbitration shall be Hong Kong. This interpretation does not render any part of the arbitration clause, meaningless or redundant. Merely because the parties have agreed that the venue of arbitration shall be Hong Kong, it does not follow that Laws in force in Hong Kong will apply. The arbitration clause states that the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (an Indian Statute) will apply. Therefore, the said Act will govern the appointment of arbitrator, the reference of disputes and the entire process and procedure of arbitration from the stage of appointment of arbitrator till the award is made and executed/given effect to.

The said plea was not advanced before the civil court in Arbitration Case.  On the contrary, both the courts below on facts have found that Jala Nigam had consented to the arbitration of the disputes by the Chief Engineer.  Jala Nigam had participated in the arbitration proceedings.  It submitted itself to the authority of the Arbitrator.  It gave consent to the appointment of the Chief Engineer as an Arbitrator.  It filed its written statements to the additional claims made by the contractor.  The executive engineer who appeared on behalf of Jala Nigam did not invoke Section 16 of the Arbitration Act.  He did not challenge the competence of the arbitral tribunal.  He did not call upon the arbitral tribunal to rule on its jurisdiction.  On the contrary, it submitted to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal.  It also filed written arguments.

It clearly indicates that the Model Law has not been bodily adopted by the Arbitration Act, 1996. But that can not mean that the territorial principle has not been accepted. It is not the function of the Court to supply the supposed omission, which can only be done by Parliament. Legislative surgery is not a judicial option, nor a compulsion, whilst interpreting an Act or a provision in the Act.     [Para 60]\n\nThe omission of the word \"only\" in Section 2(2) of the Arbitration Act, 1996 does not detract from the territorial scope of its application as embodied in Article 1(2) of the Model Law. The article merely states that the Arbitration Law as enacted in a given state shall apply if the arbitration is in the territory of that State. The absence of the word \"only\" which is found in Article 1(2) of the Model Law, from Section 2(2) of the Arbitration Act, 1996 does not change the content/import of Section 2(2) as limiting the application of Part I of the Arbitration Act, 1996 to arbitrations where the place/seat is in India.     [Para 75]\n\nIf Section 2(2) is construed as merely providing that Part I of the Arbitration Act, 1996 applies to India, it would be ex facie superfluous/redundant. No statutory provision is necessary to state/clarify that a law made by Parliament shall apply in India/to arbitrations in India. Another fundamental principle of statutory construction is that courts will never impute redundancy or tautology to Parliament.         [Para 78]\n\nSection 2(2) is not merely stating the obvious. It would not be a repetition of what is already stated in Section 1(2) of the Arbitration Act, 1996 which provides that \"it extends to the whole of India\". Since the consolidated Arbitration Act, 1996 deals with domestic, commercial and international commercial arbitrators, it was necessary to remove the uncertainty that the Arbitration Act, 1996 could also apply to arbitrations which do not take place in India. Therefore, Section 2(2) merely reinforces the limits of operation of the Arbitration Act, 1996 to India.     [Para 79]\n\nThe provisions in the Arbitration Act, 1996 must be construed by their plain language/terms. It is not permissible for the court while construing a provision to reconstruct the provision. In other words, the Court cannot produce a new jacket, whilst ironing out the creases of the old one.

Extending the applicability of Section 9 to arbitrations which take place outside India would be to do violence to the policy of the territoriality declared in Section 2(2) of the Arbitration Act, 1996.   [Para 163]\n\nSchematically, Section 9 is placed in Part I of the Arbitration Act, 1996. Therefore, it can not be granted a special status. Part I of the Arbitration Act, 1996 does not apply to arbitrations held outside India. Part II of the Arbitration Act, 1996, on the other hand, does not contain a provision similar to Section 9. Thus, on a logical and schematic construction of the Arbitration Act, 1996, the Indian Courts do not have the power to grant interim measures when the seat of arbitration is outside India. A bare perusal of Section 9 would clearly show that it relates to interim measures before or during arbitral proceedings or at any time after the making of the arbitral award, but before it is enforced in accordance with Section 36.   [Para 161]\n\nMerely, because the remedy in such circumstances may be more onerous from the view point of one party is not the same as a party being left without a remedy. Similar would be the position in cases where parties seek interim relief with regard to the protection of the assets. Once the parties have chosen voluntarily that the seat of the arbitration shall be outside India, they are impliedly also understood to have chosen the necessary incidents and consequences of such choice   [Para 167]\n\nMerely because the Arbitration Act, 1996 does not cover the non convention awards would not create a lacuna in the Arbitration Act, 1996.

That is because existence of an arbitration agreement is a jurisdictional fact which will have to be addressed while making an order on a petition under Section 11 of the Act. The position may be different where arbitration proceedings are initiated before a nominated arbitral Tribunal but the opposite party appears to dispute the existence of the arbitration agreement. In any such situation the Arbitral Tribunal can itself decide the issue in exercise of its powers under Section 16(1) of the Act. So also the parties may without approaching the Chief Justice refer the matters in dispute to the nominated Tribunal including the question whether there exists an arbitration agreement. In any such case also the Arbitral Tribunal can determine the existence of the arbitration agreement. Suffice it to say that the power available to the Arbitral Tribunal under Section 16 of the Act does not imply that the issue can be or ought to be left to be determined by the Arbitral Tribunal even in cases where one of the parties has filed a petition under Section 11 of the Act and the other party opposes the making of a reference on the ground that there exists no arbitration agreement between them. It is quite evident that the question whether or not an arbitration agreement exists between the parties will have to be answered for it is only if the answer to that question is in the affirmative that the Chief Justice or his designate can pass an order of reference of the disputes for adjudication.

There is no correspondence which would constitute any such agreement. The statement of petitioner in the notice invoking arbitration itself is denied. These are the only three modes specified under the statute in which an agreement can be taken to be an agreement in writing. Section 7(4) is exhaustive. It does not contemplate that an oral account of a document signed by the parties would also be an arbitration agreement. Had that been so Section 7 (4) would have mentioned that provision as sub section 'd'. There may be various other circumstances by which a written agreement can be proved and accounted for but that is not within the contemplation of the Arbitration Act. An arbitration agreement is in writing only if it falls within sub section a, b or c of Section 7(4). Upon such legislative mandate allowing a party to prove a written arbitration agreement by oral evidence of its contents by secondary evidence as specified in Section 63(5) of the Indian Evidence Act would be to legislate another sub section which the Court cannot do.\n\nThe purpose of this provision is to specifically exclude oral agreements unlike in a civil suit which can be filed on oral agreements so that an oral account of a written agreement can be tendered in evidence by way of secondary evidence. The purpose of having arbitration agreement only in writing rules out an oral agreement. This purpose would be destroyed if parties are allowed to claim orally as has been done in the intant case, that some agreement of some vague nature was entered into and which party can prove by oral evidence. This would open floodgates not only not contemplated but specifically excluded by the legislature.\n\nIn view of the specific ambit of Section 7(4), the mandatory requirement of Section 7(3) must be read to require only a written agreement to be produced for commencing any arbitration proceeding. Hence an application under Section 11 for appointment of arbitrator cannot be made in case where an arbitration agreement is not in writing and is not produced at the first instance.

Therefore, even assuming that there were three stoppages made during the period from August 2002 to March 2003 as alleged, the Respondents failed to prove the loss of profits and/or damages because of that. In such matters, evidence is necessary to establish the loss and the fact that who committed the delay though in certain cases based upon established formulas, subject to certain conditions, the Arbitrator may award some compensation.              [Para 10,12]\n\nThe reasoning by holding both the parties responsible for delay, is impermissible. If both the parties are responsible for delay, as observed, then one party is estopped from raising and claiming any extra amount or claim because of escalation of price. If both the parties based upon the facts and circumstances, without any objection, proceed to deal with the contract and act accordingly knowing fully the reasons for delay in completing the contract and as there was no specific agreed and/or mutually agreed fixed period for completion of the contract, in my view, there is no question of holding both the parties responsible for delay and latches and then award the amount on presumption and assumption, on account of over heads and profits as done in the present case.

After a dispute arises between the parties, they enter into an arbitration agreement to refer that specific dispute to arbitration. In such an arbitration, the arbitrator cannot enlarge the scope of arbitration by permitting either the claimant to modify or add to the claim or the respondent to make a counter claim.

As Limitation Act, 1963 is made applicable to arbitrations, in the case of a counter claim by a respondent in an arbitral proceedings, the date on which the counter claim is made before the arbitrator will be the date of \"institution\" in so far as counter claim is concerned. There is, therefore, no need to provide a date of 'commencement' as in the case of claims of a claimant. Section 21 of the Act is therefore not relevant for counter claims. There is however one exception. Where the respondent against whom a claim is made, had also made a claim against the claimant and sought arbitration by serving a notice to the claimant but subsequently raises that claim as a counter claim in the arbitration proceedings initiated by the claimant, instead of filing a separate application under section 11 of the Act, the limitation for such counter claim should be computed, as on the date of service of notice of such claim on the claimant and not on the date of filing of the counter claim.

                "description": "Reference to arbitration - Whether or not New York convention applies to arbitration agreement - Has to be decided by the court - If it applies, court has no discretion but to refer the matter to arbitration - Only exception is where arbitration agreement is found null and void, inoperative and incapable of performance - S.45 incorporates fundamental principle of separability of arbitration agreement from the main contract. \t(Para 20)\n\nThough an arbitration agreement is part of the main contract, the law regards it as a collateral and independent part of the contract. And for valid reason, quite apart from the need to preserve the business efficacy of commercial dealings. The main contract defines substantive obligations and corresponding rights. An arbitration agreement is an agreement on dispute resolution which is independently capable of specific enforcement. Hence, an arbitration agreement can and does survive a termination, repudiation or frustration of the contract. The law has evolved the doctrine of separability as the basis for enabling parties to arbitrate, independent of the status of their contract. Judges in the common law world - and we in India are no exception - have advanced the doctrine of separability to ensure that the sanctity of arbitration is not destroyed by disingenuous litigants.  [Para 22]\n\n The essential features of the doctrine of separability, are :\n\n(i) The arbitration agreement constitutes a collateral term in the contract which relates to the resolution of disputes and not to the performance of the contract. Whereas the substantive terms of a contract define the rights and obligations of the parties, an arbitration agreement provides for modalities agreed upon by parties for the resolution of their disputes. Parties agree thereby to have their disputes resolved before an arbitral tribunal as distinct from the ordinary courts of law in the jurisdiction;\n\n(ii) Upon the termination of the main contract, the arbitration agreement does not ipso facto or necessarily come to an end;\n\n(iii) The issue as to whether the arbitration agreement survives or perishes along with the main contract would depend upon the nature of the controversy and its effect upon the existence or survival of the contract itself;\n\n(iv) If the nature of the controversy is such that the main contract would itself be treated as non est in the sense that it never came into existence or was void , the arbitration clause cannot operate, for along with the original contract, the arbitration agreement is also void. Similarly, though the contract was validly executed, parties may put an end to it as if it had never existed and substitute a new contract solely governing their rights and liabilities thereunder. Even in such a case, since the original contract is extinguished or annihilated by another, the arbitration clause forming a part of the contract would perish with it;\n\n(v) There may, however, be cases where it is the future performance of the contract that has come to an end. Such an eventuality may arise due to a number of circumstances, in which one or both the parties may be discharged from further performance. Termination of the contract by one party, repudiation of the contract by one party and its acceptance by the other and frustration of the contract are some of the circumstances. The controversy in such matters arises upon or in relation to or in connection with the contract. In all such cases, the contract is not put an end to for all purposes because there may be rights and obligations which had arisen earlier when it had not come to an end. The contract subsists for those purposes and the arbitration clause would operate for those purposes;\n\n(vi) The doctrine of separability requires, for the arbitration agreement to be null and void, inoperative or incapable of performance, a direct impeachment of the arbitration agreement and not simply a parasitical impeachment based on a challenge to the validity or enforceability of the main agreement. In other words, arguments for impeaching the arbitration agreement must be based on facts which are specific to the arbitration agreement. There may, of course, be facts which are specific to both the main agreement and the arbitration agreement, but there may well be facts which are specific to the main agreement, but not to the arbitration agreement. In the former case, the arbitration clause would perish with the main contract while in the latter case, it would not. Another way of considering the matter is whether it is the further performance of the contract that is brought to an end or it is the existence of the contract which is brought to an end. In the former case, where the further performance of the contract has been brought to an end, the arbitration clause would survive whereas when the existence of the contract is itself brought to an end, the arbitration clause would not survive.

The executing Court, on perusal of the account statement, held that a sum of Rs.3,37,885/- was paid by the respondents to the appellant on 29.08.2011 which, as per the statement, was credited in appellant's account and hence such payment having been made has resulted in fully satisfying the decree in question and, therefore, the respondents are not liable to pay any amount towards decree in question. It is essentially with this factual finding, the executing Court came to a conclusion that the award/decree stood fully satisfied and hence no recovery of any awarded amount can be made and, therefore, dismissed the appellant's execution application.\n\n\tHaving regard to the nature of objections, it is clear that such objections were not capable of being tried in execution proceedings to challenge the award. It is for the reason that they were on facts and pertained to the merits of the controversy, which stood decided by the Arbitrator resulting in passing of an award. None of the objections were in relation to the jurisdiction of the Court affecting the root of the very passing of the decree. If the executing Court had probed these objections then it would have travelled behind the decree, which was not permissible in law. An inquiry into facts, which ought to have been done in a suit or in an appeal arising out of the suit or in proceedings under Section 34 of the Act, cannot be held in execution proceedings in relation to such award/decree.\t [Para 23,25,31]"

Section 16 provides that the Arbitration clause forming part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement independent of such a contract.\n\nThe Arbitration Act as noticed above, under Section 16 accepts the concept that the main contract and the arbitration agreement form two independent contracts. Commercial rights and obligations are contained in the underlying, substantive, or the main contract. It is followed by a second contract, which expresses the agreement and the intention of the parties to resolve the disputes relating to the underlying contract through arbitration. A remedy is elected by parties outside the normal civil court remedy. It is true that support of the National Courts would be required to ensure the success of arbitration, but this would not detract from the legitimacy or independence of the collateral arbitration agreement, even if it is contained in a contract, which is claimed to be void or voidable or unconcluded by one of the parties.

And the arbitration agreement, otherwise, fulfils the criteria laid down under Section 44 of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1996. Given that two Arbitrators have been appointed, the missing line that \"the two Arbitrators appointed by the parties shall appoint the third Arbitrator\" can be read into the arbitration clause. The omission is so obvious that the court can legitimately supply the missing line. In construing an arbitration clause, it is not necessary to employ the strict rules of interpretation which may be necessary to construe a statutory provision. The court would be well within its rights to set right an obvious omission without necessarily leaving itself open to the criticism of having reconstructed the clause.  [Para 85]\n\nUnder Section 10(1), there is freedom given to the parties to determine the number of Arbitrators, provided that such number shall not be an even number, Similarly, other provisions contained in Sections 8, 11 and 45 of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1996 are machinery provisions to ensure that parties can proceed to arbitration provided they have expressed the intention to Arbitrate. This intention can be expressed by the parties, as specifically provided under Section 7 of the Indian Arbitration Act, 1996 by an exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or other means of telecommunication which provide a record of the agreement. Such intention can even be expressed in the pleadings of the parties such as statements of claim and defence, in which the existence of the agreement is alleged by one party and not denied by the other.

Even if the Will had provided for reference of disputed to arbitration, it would be merely an expression of a wish by the testator that the disputes should be settled by arbitration and cannot be considered as an Arbitrator agreement among the legatees.In this case, according to the respondents, the provision for arbitration is not in the Will but in a subsequent declaration allegedly made by Testator father Durganarayan Sharma, stating that if there is any dispute in regard to his Will dated 28.12.2003, it shall be referred to his friend, U. M. Bhandari, Advocate, as the sole arbitrator whose decision shall be final and binding on the parties. A unilateral declaration by a father that any future disputes among the sons should be settled by an arbitrator named by him, can by no stretch of imagination, be considered as an arbitration agreement among his children, or such of his children who become parties to a dispute. At best, such a declaration can be expression of a fond hope by a father that his children, in the event of a dispute, should get the same settled by arbitration. It is for the children, if and when they become parties to a dispute, to decide whether they would heed to the advice of their father or not. Such a wish expressed in a declaration by a father, even if proved, cannot be construed as an agreement in writing between the parties to the dispute agreeing to refer their disputes to arbitration.   [Para 14]\n\nConsequently, there is no arbitration agreement between the parties and the learned Designate committed a serious error in allowing the application under sections 11 and 15(2) of the Act and holding that there is an arbitration agreement between the parties to the dispute and appointing an arbitrator.

However it is not providing that Part I shall not apply where the place of arbitration is not in India. It is also not providing that Part I will \"only\" apply where the place of arbitration is in India (emphasis supplied). Thus the Legislature has not provided that Part I is not to apply to arbitrations which take place outside India. The use of the language is significant and important. The Legislature is emphasising that the provisions of Part I would apply to arbitrations which take place in India, but not providing that the provisions of Part I will not apply to arbitrations which take place out of India. The wording of sub-section (2) of Section 2 suggests that the intention of the Legislature was to make provisions of Part I compulsorily applicable to an arbitration, including an international commercial arbitration, which takes place in India. Parties cannot, by agreement, override or exclude the non-derogable provisions of Part I in such arbitrations. By omitting to provide that Part I will not apply to international commercial arbitrations which take place outside India the affect would be that Part I would also apply to international commercial arbitrations held out of India. But by not specifically providing that the provisions of Part I apply to international commercial arbitrations held out of India, the intention of the Legislature appears to be to ally parties to provide by agreement that Part I or any provision therein will not apply. Thus in respect of arbitrations which take place outside India even the non-derogable provisions of Part I can be excluded. Such an agreement may be express or implied. If read in this manner there would be no conflict between Section 1 and Section 2(2). The words \"every arbitration\" in sub-section (4) of Section 2 and the words \"all arbitrations and all proceedings relating thereto\" in sub-section (5) of Section 2 are wide. Sub-sections (4) and (5) of Section 2 are not made subject to sub-section (2) of Section 2. It is significant that sub-section (5) is made subject to sub-section (4) but not to sub-section (2). To accept Mr. Sen's submission would necessitate adding words in sub-sections (4) and (5) of Section 2, which the Legislature has purposely omitted to add viz. \"Subject to provision of sub-section (2)\". However read in the manner set out hereinabove there would also be no conflict between sub-section (2) of Section 2 and sub-sections (4) and/or (5) of Section 2. That the Legislature did not intend to exclude the applicability of Part I to arbitrations, which take place outside India.   [Para 21,22,32]"

This right of the appellant to take action against an erring dealer under the terms of the Agreement is dehors the proceedings that may be available to be initiated against an erring dealer under the provisions of various other enactments referred to in Clause 20 of the said Agreement including under the provisions of the 1985 Act. This right of the Corporation to suspend the supply of petroleum products to an erring dealer is a right exercised under the terms of the contract and is independent of the statutory provisions of the various Acts enumerated in Clause 20 of the Agreement. The Courts below, have committed an error by misreading the terms of the contract when they came to the conclusion that the only remedy available as against a misconduct committed by an erring dealer in regard to short-supply and tampering with the seals lies under the provisions of the 1985 Act. The Courts below have failed to notice that when a dealer short-supplies or tampers with the seal, apart from the statutory violation, he also commits a misconduct under Clause 20 of the Agreement in regard to which the appellant is entitled to invoke Clause 30 of the Agreement to stop supply of petroleum products to such dealer. The power conferred under the Agreement does not in any manner conflict with the statutory power under the 1985 Act nor does the prescribed procedure under the 1985 Act in regard to search and seizure and prosecution apply to the power of the appellant to suspend the supply of its petroleum products to an erring dealer. The power exercised by the appellant in such a situation is a contractual power under the agreement and not a statutory one under the 1985 Act. The existence of dual procedure; one under the criminal law and the other under the contractual law is a well-accepted legal phenomenon in the Indian jurisprudence.    [Para 22]"

Where the statute has gone to great lengths to define exactly what is meant by the term \"in writing,\" we are precluded from adding another term to definition. Second, the plain language of Section 7 does not require that the parties stamp the agreement. It would be incorrect to disturb the Parliament's intention when it is so clearly stated. Third, nothing in Section 7 suggests that the parties must sign every page. Even if the faxed CPA is construed as a \"document,\" it need only be \"signed by the parties\" pursuant to Section 7(4)(a). Every page does not need to be signed. Fourth, Section 7(4)(b) states that an agreement is in writing if it is contained in \"an exchange of letters, telex, telegrams or other means of telecommunication which provide a record of the agreement.\" This section covers agreements that are sent via facsimile (\"fax\") as they are \"other means of telecommunication\". \"Fax\" is defined as \"a machine that scans documents electronically and transmits a photographic image of the contents to a receiving machine by telephone line\" or \"a document received by such a machine.\"  This definition clearly provides that a fax falls under \"other means of telecommunication.\" Thus, faxed agreements are acceptable under Section 7 of the Act. Section 7(4)(b) further requires us to ask whether a record of the agreement is found in the telecommunication, in this case a fax. What could be a better record of the agreement than the signatures of the parties themselves? As noted above, with no evidence to indicate that the respondent's signature was forged, the faxed CPA stands on its own as the record of agreement. Likewise, Section 7(4)(b) stands satisfied.   [Para 63,68]\n\nIf this Court adds a number of extra requirements such as stamps, seals and originals, we would be enhancing our role, not minimising it. Moreover, the cost of doing business would increase. It takes time to implement such formalities. What is even more worrisome is that the parties' intention to arbitrate would be foiled by formality. Such a stance would run counter to the very idea of arbitration, wherein tribunals all over the world generally bend over backwards to ensure that the parties' intention to arbitrate is upheld. Adding technicalities disturbs the parties' \"autonomy of the will\".  \t\t\t\t\t [Para 70,71]\n\nOnce it is established that the faxed CPA is valid, it follows that a valid contract and a valid arbitration clause exist. This contract, the faxed CPA, does not suffer from a conditional clause, as did the Letter of Intent. Thus, the respondent's argument that the parties were not ad idem must fail.   [Para 74]"

For example when we refer to an employer issuing a letter of appointment, it not only refers to the actual act of appointment, but includes the stipulation of the terms subject to which such appointment is made. The word 'appoint' in section 11 of the Act, therefore refers not only to the actual designation or nomination as an arbitrator, but includes specifying the terms and conditions, which the Chief Justice or Designate may lay down on the facts and circumstances of the case. Whenever the Chief Justice or his Designate appoint arbitrator/s, it will be open to him to stipulate the fees payable to the arbitrator/s, after hearing the parties and if necessary after ascertaining the fee structure from the prospective Arbitrator/s. This will avoid the embarrassment of parties having to negotiate with the Arbitrators, the fee payable to them, after their appointment.  [Para 25]\n\nThe remedy for healthy development of arbitration in India is to disclose the fees structure before the appointment of Arbitrators so that any party who is unwilling to bear such expenses can express his unwillingness. Another remedy is Institutional Arbitration where the Arbitrator's fee is pre-fixed. The third is for each High Court to have a scale of Arbitrator's fee suitably calibrated with reference to the amount involved in the dispute. This will also avoid different designates prescribing different fee structures. By these methods, there may be a reasonable check on the fees and the cost of arbitration, thereby making arbitration, both national and international, attractive to the litigant public. Reasonableness and certainty about total costs are the key to the development of arbitration.  [Para 28]"

It is enough if they have actually consulted or conferred with each other and if both or any of them communicates to the parties the appointment of the presiding arbitrator as having taken place by the joint deliberation of the two. When an effective consultation can be achieved by resort to electronic media and remote conferencing it is not necessary that the two persons required to act in consultation with each other must necessarily sit together at one place unless it is the requirement of law or of the ruling contract between the parties. The appointment need not necessarily be by a writing signed by the two arbitrators; it satisfies the requirement of law if the appointment (i) has been actually made, (ii) is preceded by such consultation as to amount to appointment by the two, and (iii) is communicated. It is not essential to the validity of the appointment that the parties should be consulted, or involved in the process of appointment or given a previous notice of the proposed appointment.

It is thus clear that the said company in application under section 11 of the Act was non-existent on 30.3.2002 when the arbitration agreement was entered into. S.7 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act defines an arbitration agreement as an agreement by the parties to submit to arbitration. The word 'party' is defined in section 2(h) of the Act as a party to an arbitration agreement. An agreement enforceable by law is a contract. An agreement has to be between two or more persons. Therefore if one of the two parties to the arbitration agreement was not in existence when the contract was made, then obviously there was no contract and if there was no contract, there is no question of a clause in such contract being an arbitration agreement between the parties. This is not a case of one of the parties being in existence, but being under some legal disability to enter into contracts. This is a case where there was no 'party' at all, but someone claiming that there was an existing company capable of entering into contracts. The position would have been different, had the agreement been entered by the promoters of the respondent company before its incorporation for the purposes of the company and such contract was warranted by the terms of incorporation.

It may be understood to mean the amount which one has contracted to pay for the use of borrowed money. It is a consideration paid either for the use of money or for forbearance in demanding it, after it has fallen due, and thus, it could be said to be a charge for the use or forbearance of a particular amount of money. In this sense, it is a compensation allowed in law for use of money belonging to another or for the delay in paying the said money after it has become payable. For an amount to be referred as \"interest\", it must, prima facie, fulfill two conditions-\n\n(1)  There must be a sum of money by reference to which the payment of interest may be ascertained.\n\n(2)  The sum of money must, generally, be due to the person entitled to the interest.\n\nFurthermore, it would be gainsaid in stating that the mere fact that a payment of interest may be aggregated with a payment of a different nature, the said aggregation would not alter the distinct nature of interest from the money on which it is levied.

Dattu, C.J.I. (Dissenting) :- \n\nClause (b) of sub-section (7) is applicable for the period from the date of award to the date of payment. The applicability of clause (b) has also been qualified by the legislature. The said clause uses the phrase \"unless the award otherwise directs\", which would mean that in the event the arbitral tribunal, in its award, makes a provision for interest to be imposed in this second stage as envisaged by sub-section (7) of section 31 of the Act, 1996, clause (b) would become inapplicable. By the said award, the arbitral tribunal has the power to impose an interest for the post-award period which may be higher or lower than the rate as prescribed under clause (b). Even if the award states that no interest shall be imposed in the post-award period, clause (b) cannot be invoked.\n\nIf the arbitral award is silent on the question of whether there would be any post- award interest, only in that situation could clause (b) be made applicable. In the said situation, it would be mandatory as per law that the award would carry interest at the rate of 18% per annum from the date of the award to the date of payment. The term used in the given clause is \"shall\", therefore, if applicable, the imposition of interest as per clause (b) would be mandatory.    [Para 50]\n\nFor the purposes of the Act, 1996, interest could be included within the principal amount only when the said aggregate amount is paid to the party in whose favour the arbitral award was passed. In other words, once the interest amount is within the physical and actual possession of the party so entitled to it, only then could the interest amount be said to have merged with the principal amount. Therefore, the term \"sum\" as used in clause (b) of sub- section (7) of section 31 of the Act, 1996 would have the same meaning as assigned to the word under clause (a) of the same provision. It would refer to the money as adjudicated by the arbitral tribunal based on the claim of the parties to the arbitral proceedings. It has already been noticed that this money would be distinct from the interest as may have been awarded by the arbitral tribunal under clause (a) of sub- section (7) of section 31 of the Act, 1996. Therefore, the interest under clause (b) would be imposed on money awarded by the arbitral tribunal on the basis of the claims of the parties, and the said money cannot merge within it any interest as imposed in the period from the date of cause of action to the date of the award.

An arbitral award may be set aside by the Court only if the grounds stated in sub-section (2) are satisfied and application to that effect are placed before the Court. The expression 'May' sufficiently indicates that larger discretion is vested in the Court which has to be exercised in accordance with the settled canons of judicial discretion and the context would require that the expression 'may' should be read as \"may\" alone and does not admit or invite any other meaning or interpretation. The other expression which is of significance is 'only if'. The word 'only if' empowers the Court to set aside an award only if conditions of sub-clauses (a) and (b) of sub-section (2) are satisfied. In other words, it is for the grounds stated in the said provisions alone that the award can be set aside and not otherwise. Further an obligation is cast upon the applicants to furnish proof thereof. The word \"proof\" again has some definite value in law and it cannot be equated to the word 'ground' or 'alleged facts'. Thus, the provisions of sub-section (2) of section 34 contemplate a higher degree of deliberation than a mere statement of fact when an award is challenged. It is expected that the documents produced in evidence before the arbitral tribunal would be the proof in support of an objection raised by an applicant. The applicant should be able to demonstrate from the record that his objection is supported by evidence and is not a mere objection for the sake of objecting. The word \"proof\" need be understood in the sense in which it is defined in the Evidence Act because proof depends upon the admissibility of evidence. A fact is said to be proved when, after considering the matters before it, the court either believes it to exist, or considers its existence so probable that a prudent man ought, under the circumstances of the particular case, to act upon the supposition that it exists. This is the definition given for the word \"proved\" in the Evidence Act. What is required is production of such materials on which the court can reasonably act to reach the supposition that a fact exists. 'Proof' of the fact depends upon the degree of probability of its having existed. The standard required for reaching the supposition is that of a prudent man acting in any important matter concerning him. 2001 ALL MR (Cri) 565 (S.C.) - Rel. on.  [Para 16]"

Once the Arbitral Tribunal makes an award and terminates the proceedings under Section 32, subject to provisions contained in Part-I. An arbitral award shall be final and binding on the parties and even on the persons claiming under them respectively in terms of Section 35 of the Act. This award attains not only finality but becomes enforceable as a decree of the Civil Court under the Code of Civil Procedure, after the period stated under Section 34 of the Act. Thus, an award which attains finality and becomes enforceable vesting a legal right in the claimants. It will be unjust and unfair to deny statutory rights accrued to the parties even by not applying the doctrine of severability if some part of the award is unsustainable and where other part of the award is found to be good and enforceable in law by the Court in exercise of its powers vested under Section 34 of the Act.  [Para 28]\n\nThe process of arbitration even under 1996 Act encumbersome process which concludes after considerable lapse of time. To compel the parties, particularly a party who had succeeded to undergo the arbitral process all over again does not appear to be in conformity with the scheme of the Act. The provisions of section 34 are quite pari materia to the provisions of Article 34 of the Model Law except that the proviso and explanation have been added to section 34(2)(iv). The attempt under the Model Law and the Indian Law appears to circumscribe the jurisdiction of the court to set aside an award. There is nothing in the provisions of the Act and for that matter absolutely nothing in the Model Law which can debar the court from applying the principle of severability provided it is otherwise called for in the facts and circumstances of the case and in accordance with law. The courts will not get into the merits of the dispute. Thus, the interpretation which should be accepted by the court should be the one which will tilt in favour of the Model Laws, scheme of the Act and the objects sought to be achieved by the Act of 1996.

                ],
                "description": "Civil P.C. (1908), S.89 - Substitution of arbitrator - When the agreement does not specifically deal with such aspect - Held, substitution must take place, unless the agreement excludes either expressly or by necessary implication the substitution of arbitrator - Such substitution has to be made in accordance with arbitration clause which operates as \"the rules\" for new appointment - Continuation of arbitration with such substituted arbitrator would sub-serve the object of speedy resolution of dispute.\n\nThe scheme of Section 8 of the 1940 Act and the scheme of Section 15(2) of the 1996 Act needs to be appreciated. Under Section 8(1)(b) read with Section 8(2) if a situation arises in which an arbitrator refuses to act, any party may serve the other parties or the arbitrators, as the case may be, with a written notice to concur in a fresh appointment, and if such appointment is not made within 15 clear days after service of notice, the Court steps in to appoint such fresh arbitrator who, by a deeming fiction, is to act as if he has been appointed by the consent of all parties. This can only be done where the arbitration agreement does not show that it was intended that the vacancy caused be not supplied. However, under Section 15(2) of 1996 Act, where the mandate of an arbitrator terminates, a substitute arbitrator \"shall\" be appointed. Had Section 15(2) ended there, it would be clear that in accordance with the object sought to be achieved by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 in all cases and for whatever reason the mandate of an arbitrator terminates, a substitute arbitrator is mandatorily to be appointed. Supreme Court, however, in its landmark judgments, has interpreted the latter part of the Section 15(2) as including a reference to the arbitration agreement or arbitration clause which would then be \"the rules\" applicable to the appointment of the arbitrator being replaced. It is in this manner that the scheme of the repealed Section 8 is resurrected while construing Section 15(2). The arbitration agreement between the parties has now to be seen, and it is for this reason that unless it is clear that an arbitration agreement on the facts of a particular case excludes either expressly or by necessary implication the substitution of an arbitrator, whether named or otherwise, such a substitution must take place. In fact, sub-sections (3) and (4) of Section 15 also throw considerable light on the correct construction of sub-section (2). Under sub-section (3), when an arbitrator is replaced, any hearings previously held by the replaced arbitrator may or may not be repeated at the discretion of the newly appointed Tribunal, unless parties have agreed otherwise. Equally, orders or rulings of the earlier arbitral Tribunal are not to be invalid only because there has been a change in the composition of the earlier Tribunal, subject, of course, to a contrary agreement by parties. This also indicates that the object of speedy resolution of disputes by arbitration would best be sub-served by a substitute arbitrator continuing at the point at which the earlier arbitrator has left off.\n\n(2006) 6 SCC 204, (2009) 10 SCC 293, (2012) 7 SCC 71 Rel. on. [Para 20]\n\n Whenever parties agree for mediation, and even name a specific arbitrator with no specific provision for appointment of another arbitrator on the recusal/withdrawal of the said arbitrator, the said omission is made up by Section 15(2) of the Act and unless arbitration agreement between the parties provides a categorical prohibition or debarment in resolving a question or dispute or difference between the parties by a substitute arbitrator in case of death or the named arbitrator or non availability of the said arbitrator, Courts have the power to appoint substitute arbitrator, which power is given by Section 15(2) of the Act as this provision is to be given liberal interpretation so as to apply to all possible circumstances under which the mandate of the earlier arbitrator may be terminated.

However, in the said suit which was filed, parties arrived at an agreement whereby it was agreed between them that the matter be decided through arbitration and not by the court of law. \n\nWhat is to be kept in mind is that once arbitration agreement was entered into between the parties, that too in a pending suit (in terms of S.89 of CPC), the intention of the parties was to settle the matter through arbitration and not to come back to the Court again for decision of the same dispute by court adjudicatory process. \n\nProvisions of Section 15(2) of the Act require purposive interpretation so that the aforesaid objective/ purpose of such a provision is achieved thereby. The principle of 'purposive interpretation' or 'purposive construction' is based on the understanding that the Court is supposed to attach that meaning to the provisions which serve the 'purpose' behind such a provision. The basic approach is to ascertain what is it designed to accomplish? To put it otherwise, by interpretative process the Court is supposed to realise the goal that the legal text is designed to realise.\n\nDynamic statutory interpretation also persuades us to take into consideration ethoes of arbitration process, including the spirit behind Section 89 of the CPC.\n\nOnce we keep in mind the aforesaid fundamental aspects of the arbitration, the irresistible conclusion would be that whenever parties agree for mediation, and even name a specific arbitrator with no specific provision for appointment of another arbitrator on the recusal/withdrawal of the said arbitrator, the said omission is made up by Section 15(2) of the Act and unless arbitration agreement between the parties provides a categorical prohibition or debarment in resolving a question or dispute or difference between the parties by a substitute arbitrator in case of death or the named arbitrator or non availability of the said arbitrator, Courts have the power to appoint substitute arbitrator, which power is given by Section 15(2) of the Act as this provision is to be given liberal interpretation so as to apply to all possible circumstances under which the mandate of the earlier arbitrator may be terminated.

There can however be a justifiable apprehension about the independence or impartiality of an employee arbitrator, if such person was the controlling or dealing authority in regard to the subject contract or if he is a direct subordinate to the officer whose decision is the subject-matter of the dispute.\n\n(ii) \tUnless the cause of action for invoking jurisdiction under Clauses (a), (b) or (c) of sub-section (6) of Section 11 of 1996 Act arises, there is no question of the Chief Justice or his designate exercising power under sub-section (6) of Section 11.\n\n(iii) \tThe Chief Justice or his designate while exercising power under sub-section (6) of Section 11 shall endeavour to give effect to the appointment procedure prescribed in the arbitration clause.\n\n(iv) \tWhile exercising such power under sub section (6) of Section 11, If circumstances exist, giving rise to justifiable doubts as to the independence and impartiality of the person nominated, or if other circumstances warrant appointment of an independent arbitrator by ignoring the procedure prescribed, the Chief Justice or his designate may, for reasons to be recorded ignore the designated arbitrator and appoint someone else.\n\nB.\tIn cases governed by 1996 Act after the Amendment Act has come into force:- \n\n\tIf the arbitration clause finds foul with the amended provisions, the appointment of the Arbitrator even if apparently in conformity with the arbitration clause in the agreement, would be illegal and thus the Court would be within its powers to appoint such arbitrator(s) as may be permissible."

The said appeal is maintainable and submission of respondent that the appeal is not maintainable as the impugned order does not grant or refuses to grant interim relief u/S.9, is not acceptable. Because, the immediate impact of the impugned order may be innocuous as it neither grants nor refuses to grant interim measure under Section 9 and it merely returns the application to the appellants for being presented to an appropriate forum. But the impact also has its ripple effect which hits the appellants and even the respondents in an adverse manner. The ripple effect in this case is quite like a seismic wave which causes more damage at farther distance than at the origin or at the epicentre as far as the party seeking the interim measure under Section 9 of the Arbitration Act is concerned. A preliminary objection taken on the ground of lack of jurisdiction when wrongly decided, would defeat the valuable right of the party to get immediate protection. The purpose of Section 9 is to swing law into motion without any loss of time to preserve the property, secure the amount in question, maintain status quo and the like. This right of the party to approach the Court for getting immediate interim relief under Section 9 would be seriously prejudiced, when the preliminary objection is upheld wrongly. This is because if later on it is found that the Court upholding the preliminary objection did have the jurisdiction and the other Court to whom that party was directed did not have the jurisdiction, the position will be back to square one. Similarly, if the preliminary objection is wrongly rejected and the proceedings of the application are continued, although ought not to have been continued, a valuable right of the defendant, who is otherwise entitled to get the application dismissed on a preliminary ground, would also be seriously imperilled. Therefore, appealability of an order has to be guaged by not only its immediate effect but also its ripple effect. If the ripple effect brings the order within the circumference of Section 9, it would be an order appealable under Section 37(1)(b) of the Arbitration Act, which is what the order impugned herein is.\t\t\t\t [Para 9,10,12]"

The approach in analysing the terms of agreement should be straight and plain but at the same time cohesive and logical. In the matter of interpretation, the court has to make different approaches depending upon the instrument falling for interpretation. Legislative drafting is made by experts and is subjected to scrutiny at different stages before it takes final shape of an Act, Rule or Regulation. There is another category of drafting by lawmen or document writers who are professionally qualified and experienced in the field like drafting deeds, treaties, settlements in court, etc. And then there is the third category of documents made by laymen who have no knowledge of law or expertise in the field. The legal quality or perfection of the document is comparatively low in the third category, high in second and higher in first. No doubt, in the process of interpretation in the first category, the courts do make an attempt to gather the purpose of the legislation, its context and text. In the second category also, the text as well as the purpose is certainly important, and in the third category of documents like wills, it is simply intention alone of the executor that is relevant. In the present case being a contract executed between the two parties, the court cannot adopt an approach for interpreting a statute. The terms of the contract will have to be understood in the way the parties wanted and intended them to be. In that context, particularly in agreements of arbitration, where party autonomy is the grundnorm, how the parties worked out the agreement, is one of the indicators to decipher the intention, apart from the plain or grammatical meaning of the expressions and the use of the expressions at the proper places in the agreement.\n\n(1998) 1 WLR 461 CA Ref. to.

                "description": "Arbitration clause in 'Trust Deed' - Does not constitute arbitration agreement - Because 'Trust Deed' is signed only by settlor of trust and not by beneficiaries - Beneficiaries cannot be regarded as 'party' to such deed - There being no proposal and acceptance, Trust Deed does not partake nature of agreement - Application u/S.11 for appointment of arbitrator in matters of trust, therefore, not maintainable - Also because, such a clause in trust deed has effect of ousting jurisdiction of Civil Court which cannot be readily inferred - Matters relating to trust can only be decided by forums prescribed under Trust Act - This decision has added one more category of non-arbitrable cases as specified in Booz Allen's case 2011(7) ALL MR 786 (S.C.).\n\n\tIn the case of a Will, the testator executes the Will in favour of legatee(s) whereas in the case of a Trust, the settlor executes the deed in favour of the beneficiaries. In both the cases, it is the testator/settlor who signs the document alone. That apart, both the deeds convey the interest in the estate in favour of the legatees or/and beneficiaries. However, since legatee/beneficiaries do not sign the document or not required to sign such document, they are not regarded as party to such deed despite legatee/beneficiaries/trustees accepting the deed. Such deed, therefore, does not partake the nature of an agreement between such parties. In the light of foregoing discussion, it is to be held that the Trust Deed including the arbitration clause does not satisfy the requirements of Section 2(b) and 2(h) read with Section 7 of the Act and hence, the Trust Deed cannot be construed as an \"arbitration agreement\" within the meaning of Section 7 of the Act. \n2010 ALL SCR 682 Rel. on. \t [Para 33,35]\n\n\tThere is always a proposal and then its acceptance in the case of every agreement, which is not required in the case of creation of the Trust because in the case of a Trust, the trustee and beneficiary though accept its creation but by such acceptance, they merely undertake to carry out the terms of the Trust Deed in so far as the same may be in accordance with law. The clause relating to arbitration in the Trust Deed is one of the several clauses. The other clauses which deal with several types of directions to the trustees and beneficiaries such as how the Trust should be managed, how the amount of the Trust should be spent etc. are not in the nature of agreement between the trustees or/and beneficiaries. In other words, by accepting the Trust Deed, it cannot be said that the trustees or beneficiaries have agreed amongst themselves as to how they should spend the money or how they should manage the affairs of the Trust or receive any benefit.\t [Para 42]\n\n\tFurther, the clause in an agreement, which provides for deciding the disputes arising out of such agreement through private arbitration, affects the jurisdiction of the Civil Court and the ouster of jurisdiction of Courts cannot be inferred readily. The Arbitration Act is one such law, which provides for ouster of jurisdiction of the Civil Courts. The Act, inter alia, provides a forum for deciding the disputes inter se parties to an agreement through arbitration. Such clause requires strict rule of interpretation to find out whether it provides an ouster of jurisdiction and, if so, to which Court/Tribunal/Authority as the case may be. In the case at hand, when we apply this principle of interpretation, we do not find that arbitration clause in Trust deed enables the arbitrator to assume the jurisdiction to decide the disputes arising between the beneficiaries. In other words, said clause does not satisfy the rigour of Sections 2(b), 2(h) and 7 of the Act. \t [Para 43]\n\n\tOn examining the Scheme of the Trust Act, found no difficulty in concluding that though the Trust Act do not provide any express bar in relation to applicability of other Acts for deciding the disputes arising under the Trust Act yet, there exists an implied bar of exclusion of applicability of the Arbitration Act for deciding the disputes relating to Trust, trustees and beneficiaries through private arbitration. Since sufficient and adequate remedy is provided under the Trust Act for deciding the disputes in relation to Trust Deed, Trustees and beneficiaries, the remedy provided under the Arbitration Act for deciding such disputes is barred by implication.\t  [Para 58,59]\n\n\t The disputes relating to Trust, trustees and beneficiaries arising out of the Trust Deed and the Trust Act are not capable of being decided by the arbitrator despite existence of arbitration agreement to that effect between the parties. Therefore application filed by the respondents under Section 11 of the Act is not maintainable on the ground that firstly, it is not based on an \"arbitration agreement\" within the meaning of Sections 2(b) and 2(h) read with Section 7 of the Act and secondly, assuming that there exists an arbitration agreement (clause in the Trust Deed) yet the disputes specified therein are not capable of being referred to private arbitration for their adjudication on merits.\t [Para 61]\n\n\tThus one more category of cases can be added, i.e. category (vii), namely, cases arising out of Trust Deed and the Trust Act, in the list of (vi) categories of cases specified by Supreme Court in Para 36 at page 547 of the decision rendered in the case of Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc. (supra) which cannot be decided by the arbitrator(s).\t [Para 62]"

The provision of section 33(4) of the Act only says that if the Arbitrator has omitted to decide such claim, the party who had filed such claim can bring this omission to the notice of the learned Arbitrator. The Arbitral Tribunal is already constituted and so the notice mentioned in section 33(4) is not the notice which can be called as mandatory and of the nature mentioned in section 11 of the Act. This Court has no hesitation to observe that the purpose behind this notice is only to give an opportunity to other side to have its say and contest the matter raised before the Arbitral Tribunal. Thus, it cannot be said that the consent of other side who will be benefited due to such omission is necessary for application under section 33(4) of the Act. If such interpretation of provision of section 33(4) is done, then this provision will be become otiose. It can be said that when the omission is brought to the notice of the Arbitrator under section 33(4) of the Act, it will be the duty of the so called party applying under section 33(4) of the Act and the Arbitrator to see that the other side gets opportunity to contest this contention also. \t\t [Para 21]"

This does not exclude the autonomy of the parties to an arbitral award to mutually agree to a procedure whereby the arbitral award might be reconsidered by another arbitrator or panel of arbitrators by way of an appeal and the result of that appeal is accepted by the parties to be final and binding subject to a challenge provided for by the Arbitration Act. The fact that recourse to a court is available to a party for challenging an award does not ipso facto prohibit the parties from mutually agreeing to a second look at an award with the intention of an early settlement of disputes and differences. The intention of Section 34 of the Arbitration Act and of the international arbitration community is to avoid subjecting a party to an arbitration agreement to challenges to an award in multiple forums, say by way of proceedings in a civil court as well under the arbitration statute. The intention is not to throttle the autonomy of the parties or preclude them from adopting any other acceptable method of redressal such as an appellate arbitration.\t         [Para 27,28]"

Certain requirements had to be satisfied for a judicial authority to refer the parties to Arbitration under the Act of 1940. Firstly a party to the legal proceedings could at any time before the filing of written statement or taking another step in the proceedings, apply to the judicial authority for stay of the proceedings.  Consequently the Judicial authority had to be satisfied that there was no sufficient reason why matter should not be referred in accordance with arbitration agreement and that the applicant, was at the time when the proceedings were commenced and still remains ready and willing to do all things necessary for the proper conduct of the arbitration.  On being satisfied, such authority had to make an order staying the proceedings.  It is clear from the language of Section 34 that Judicial authority or court was not obliged or bound to refer the parties to arbitration. There was discretion in the court.  Even if the applicant satisfied the requirements, namely of applying before filing of written statement or taking any steps in the proceedings and also expressing intent or desire to be ready and willing to comply with all necessary things for the proper conduct of the arbitration, the court could refuse to stay the suit.  The language of Section 8 of the Act of 1996 is on the other hand mandatory.  The Judicial authority has no discretion,if an application is moved before filing the first statement of defence and if the subject matter of the suit is governed by the arbitral clause.

It is well established that general law cannot defeat a provision of special law to the extent to which they are in conflict; else effort has to be made on reconciling the two provisions by homogeneous reading. In the present case, the provisions of section 37 (the relevant portion of which is pari materia relevant portion of section 39 of 1940 Act) leave no manner of doubt that the provisions of the special enactment will prevail over the general law namely, the 1908 Code. The Statutory Scheme of 1996 Act and the Letters Patent and the binding precedents of Supreme Court and this Court lead to only one conclusion that clause 15 of the Letters Patent are impliedly excluded by the 1996 Act.\n\nAnother way of looking at this aspect is the question as to what would be effect of holding that a Letters Patent Appeal is maintainable in juxta position to the scheme of the 1996 Act. Under section 2(e) of the 1996 Act, the term \"court\" is defined. As per the definition, in Mumbai, the High Court is the Court which is the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction for the geographical area of Greater Mumbai which consists of 2 districts namely, Mumbai and Mumbai suburban. In other districts by virtue of definition of the term \"principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction\" given in the Bombay Civil Courts Act 1862, the respective district courts would be \"courts\" under section 2(e) of the 1996 Act. If it is held that the Letters Patent Appeal is maintainable, when an order in proceedings under section 36 of the 1996 Act is passed by a Single Judge of High Court, a Letters Patent Appeal will lie to the Division Bench whereas if an order is passed by the District Court outside Mumbai and Mumbai suburban district, no appeal would be maintainable either under the 1996 Act or under the Civil Procedure Code.\n\nIf the aforesaid interpretation is accepted it would lead to a piquant situation where if an order in proceeding under section 36 is passed by Single Judge of High Court, the same will become appealable whereas an order passed by the Judge of the District Court will not be appealable.\n\n2011 (7) SCALE 513; 1961 SCR 497; (1993) 3 SCC 1; (2002) 5 SCC 510; (2001) 8 SCC 470; (2002) 4 SCC 447; 1994 (3) BOM.C.R. 139; 2002 (5) BOM.C.R. 567 Rel. on.

The Arbitration Act 1940 (10 of 1940) amended section 104 of the Code and subclause (a) to (f) of sub-section 1 of section 104 of the Code, which all dealt with arbitration proceedings, were deleted. The legislative intent was thus very clear that the Civil Procedure Code will not deal with any matter in relation to the arbitration and precisely for this reason the legislative intent would be clear namely that the arbitration proceedings and all proceedings arising therefrom will be governed only by the Arbitration Act, 1940 which has been repealed and replaced by 1996 Act. The Supreme Court has already interpreted the words \"as if it was a decree of the court\" which clearly shows that only the procedure for enforcement of a decree passed by the Civil Court is to be utilised for enforcement of an award and, merely on that ground, the said proceedings do not become proceedings under the Code. They continue to be proceedings under the 1996 Act. In fact section 19 of the 1996 Act also makes it clear that the provisions of the Code do not apply to the arbitration proceedings. This is a departure from the 1940 Act in as much as under section 41 of the said Act it was provided that subject to the provisions of 1940 Act the provisions of the Code shall apply to all proceedings before the Court under that Act and to all appeals under that Act. Such a provision is completely absent in the 1996 Act and this is one more indication that the proceedings under 1996 Act even for implementation of award cannot be considered to be proceedings under the Code.\n\n2007 ALL SCR 24 Rel. on.\n\nAIR 1962 SC 256; (1993) 3 SCC 1 Ref. to.

Loss suffered due to flooding. Surveyor appointed, submitted final report. Respondent protested for taking sum insured and delay tactics. Respondent under pressure signed and gave undated discharge voucher and payment was released by Appellant. Arbitrator appointed by High Court as dispute existed regarding discharge voucher and its signing voluntarily or under pressure or coercion. In further appeal, held, when a respondent contends that the dispute is not arbitrable on account of discharge of the contract under a settlement agreement or discharge voucher or no-claim certificate, and the claimant contends that it was obtained by fraud, coercion or under influence, the issue will have to be decided either by the Chief Justice/his designate in the proceedings under section 11 of the Act or by the arbitral Tribunal as directed by the order under section 11 of the Act. A claim for arbitration cannot be rejected merely or solely on ground that a settlement agreement or discharge voucher has been executed by claimant and if its validity is disputed by claimant. If the party who has executed discharge agreement or discharge voucher alleges that its execution was on account of fraud/coercion/undue influence practiced by other party and is able to establish same, then obviously discharge of contract by such agreement/voucher is rendered void and cannot be acted upon. Any dispute raised by such party would be arbitrable. Receipt is undated, containing irrelevant, inappropriate statements, claimants required to sign on dotted line. Vouchers insisted and taken mechanically without application of mind. When discharge voucher was signed and given by Respondent payment had not been made. It was made after receiving voucher. Therefore, at time of signing voucher by Respondent and at time of its delivery to Appellant, contents of voucher that amount had been received in full and final settlement of all claims, in consideration of such payment, insurer was absolved from any further liability are all false and not supported by consideration. High Court rightly found prima facie no accord and satisfaction or discharge of contract. Appeal dismissed. It is open to Appellant to lead evidence before Arbitrator to establish that there was valid and binding discharge of contract by way of accord and satisfaction.  [Para 2,18,28,29,30,31]"

But there is an exception. Where both parties to a contract confirm in writing that the contract has been fully and finally discharged by performance of all obligations and there are no outstanding claims or disputes, courts will not refer any subsequent claim or dispute to arbitration. Similarly, where one of the parties to the contract issues a full and final discharge voucher (or no due certificate as the case may be) confirming that he has received the payment in full and final satisfaction of all claims, and he has no outstanding claim, that amounts to discharge of the contract by acceptance of performance and the party issuing the discharge voucher/certificate cannot thereafter make any fresh claim or revive any settled claim. Nor can he seek reference to arbitration in respect of any claim. A reference in that regard to the discharge of contract by an agreement signed by both parties or by execution of a full and final discharge voucher/receipt by one of the parties is to an agreement or voucher which is validly and voluntarily executed. If the party who has executed discharge agreement or voucher, alleges that execution of such discharge agreement or voucher was on account of fraud/coercion/undue influence practiced by the other party and is able to establish the same, then obviously the discharge of the contract by such agreement/voucher is rendered void and cannot be acted upon.

Thus, it is not permissible for such Tribunals/authorities to travel beyond the terms of reference. Powers cannot be exercised by the Tribunal so as to enlarge materially the scope of reference itself.\n\nIf the dispute is within the scope of the arbitration clause, it is no part of the province of the court to enter into the merits of the dispute on the issue not referred to it. If the award goes beyond the reference or there is an error apparent on the face of the award it would certainly be open to the court to interfere with such an award.\n\nAn umpire or arbitrator cannot widen his jurisdiction by deciding a question not referred to him by the parties. If he exceeded his jurisdiction by so doing, his award would be liable to be set aside. Thus, an arbitrator cannot be allowed to assume jurisdiction over a question which has not been referred to him, and similarly, he cannot widen his jurisdiction by hold- ing contrary to the fact that the matter which he wants to decide is within the submission of the parties.\n\nIf the arbitrator commits an error in the construction of the contract, that is an error within his jurisdiction. But if he wanders outside the contract and deals with matters not allotted to him, he commits a jurisdictional error. Extrinsic evidence is admissible in such cases because the dispute is not something which arises under or in relation to the contract or dependent on the construction of the contract or to be determined within the award. The ambiguity of the award can, in such cases, be resolved by admitting extrinsic evidence. The rationale of this rule is that the nature of the dispute is something which has to be determined outside and independent of what appears in the award. Such a jurisdictional error needs to be proved by evidence extrinsic to the award.(2008) 18 SCC 80 and  A.I.R. 1999 SC 2262 - Rel. on.\t                  [Para 6,7,8]"

Now, if Arbitration Act, 1940 was held to be a self-contained code, on matters pertaining to arbitration the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, which consolidates, amends and designs the law relating to arbitration to bring it, as much as possible, in harmony with the UNCITRAL Model must be held only to be more so. Once it is held that the Arbitration Act is a selfcontained code and exhaustive, then it must also be held, that it carries with it \"a negative import that only such acts as are mentioned in the Act are permissible to be done and acts or things not mentioned therein are not permissible to be done\". In other words, a Letters Patent Appeal would be excluded by application of one of the general principles that where the special Act sets out a self-contained code the applicability of the general law procedure would be impliedly excluded. We, thus, arrive at the conclusion regarding the exclusion of a letters patent appeal in two different ways; one, so to say, on a micro basis by examining the scheme devised by sections 49 and 50 of the 1996 Act and the radical change that it brings about in the earlier provision of appeal under section 6 of the 1961 Act and the other on a macro basis by taking into account the nature and character of the 1996 Act as a self-contained and exhaustive code in itself. Hence no letters patent appeal will lie against an order which is not appealable under S.50 of the Act. (2004) 11 SCC 672, Rel. on.\t [Para 72,73,74]"

                "description": "\"Public policy\" - Award contrary to \"fundamental policy of Indian Law\", \"The interest of India\" and \"justice or morality\", would be set aside as being contrary to public policy of India.\n\nThe violation of the Foreign Exchange Act and disregarding orders of superior courts in India would be regarded as being contrary to the fundamental policy of Indian law. To this it could be added that the binding effect of the judgment of a superior court being disregarded would be equally violative of the fundamental policy of Indian law. The juristic principle of a \"judicial approach\" demands that a decision be fair, reasonable and objective. On the obverse side, anything arbitrary and whimsical would obviously not be a determination which would either be fair, reasonable or objective.\n\n The Audi Alteram Partem principle which undoubtedly is a fundamental juristic principle in Indian law is also contained in Sections 18 and 34 (2) (a) (iii) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. The third juristic principle is that a decision which is perverse or so irrational that no reasonable person would have arrived at the same is important and requires some degree of explanation. It is settled law that where-\n\n1.  a finding is based on no evidence, or\n\n2.  an arbitral tribunal takes into account something irrelevant to the decision which it arrives at; or\n\n3.  ignores vital evidence in arriving at its decision, such decision would necessarily be perverse.\n\nWhen a court is applying the \"public policy\" test to an arbitration award, it does not act as a court of appeal and consequently errors of fact cannot be corrected. A possible view by the arbitrator on facts has necessarily to pass muster as the arbitrator is the ultimate master of the quantity and quality of evidence to be relied upon when he delivers his arbitral award. Thus an award based on little evidence or on evidence which does not measure up in quality to a trained legal mind would not be held to be invalid on this score. Once it is found that the arbitrators approach is not arbitrary or capricious, then he is the last word on facts.\n\n The next ground on which an award may be set aside is that it is contrary to the interest of India. Obviously, this concerns itself with India as a member of the world community in its relations with foreign powers. As at present advised, we need not dilate on this aspect as this ground may need to evolve on a case by case basis.\n\n An award can be said to be against justice only when it shocks the conscience of the court. An illustration of this can be given. A claimant is content with restricting his claim, let us say to Rs. 30 lakhs in a statement of claim before the arbitrator and at no point does he seek to claim anything more. The arbitral award ultimately awards him 45 lakhs without any acceptable reason or justification. Obviously, this would shock the conscience of the court and the arbitral award would be liable to be set aside on the ground that it is contrary to \"justice\". \n\n The other ground is of \"morality.\" Apex court has confined morality to sexual morality so far as section 23 of the Contract Act is concerned, which in the context of an arbitral award would mean the enforcement of an award say for specific performance of a contract involving prostitution. \"Morality\" would, if it is to go beyond sexual morality necessarily cover such agreements as are not illegal but would not be enforced given the prevailing mores of the day. However, interference on this ground would also be only if something shocks the court's conscience.\n\n The \"patent illegality principle contains three sub-heads viz. \n\n(a)  a contravention of the substantive law of India would result in the death knell of an arbitral award. This must be understood in the sense that such illegality must go to the root of the matter and cannot be of a trivial nature. This again is really a contravention of Section 28(1)(a) of the Act, \n\n(b)  a contravention of the Arbitration Act itself would be regarded as a patent illegality- for example if an arbitrator gives no reasons for an award in contravention of section 31(3) of the Act, such award will be liable to be set aside.\n\n(c)  Equally, the third sub-head of patent illegality is really a contravention of Section 28 (3) of the Arbitration Act. \n\nThis last contravention must be understood with a caveat. An arbitral tribunal must decide in accordance with the terms of the contract, but if an arbitrator construes a term of the contract in a reasonable manner, it will not mean that the award can be set aside on this ground. Construction of the terms of a contract is primarily for an arbitrator to decide unless the arbitrator construes the contract in such a way that it could be said to be something that no fair minded or reasonable person could do.

It adopted what it called a formula for \"rough and ready justice\". This cannot be done by any court under the jurisdiction exercised under Section 34 of the Arbitration Act. The expression \"justice\" when it comes to setting aside an award under the public policy ground can only mean that an award shocks the conscience of the court. It cannot possibly include what the court thinks is unjust on the facts of a case for which it then seeks to substitute its view for the Arbitrator's view and does what it considers to be \"justice\". With great respect to the Division Bench, the whole approach to setting aside arbitral awards was incorrect. The Division Bench has lost sight of the fact that it is not a first appellate court and cannot interfere with errors of fact.        [Para 22]"

It also provides that if the award is silent about interest from the date of award till date of payment, the person in whose favour the award is made will be entitled to interest at 18% per annum on the principal amount awarded, from the date of award till date of payment.

He further directed that in case the \"total amount of the award together with this interest\" is not paid within 30 days from the date of making the award, future interest shall be paid at the rate 18% per annum on the entire Award from the date of Award upto the actual date of payment.  The words \"total amount of the Award together with interest\" makes it clear that the Arbitrator has used the words \"total amount of the Award\" as referring to the total or aggregate of the awards on the substantive claims of the contractor (claims 1 to 7) excluding the ancillary claims (claim No.8) relating to interest.  The Arbitrator has also used the words \"entire award\" and \"sums due\" synonymous with the words \"total amount of the award\".  Therefore, when the operative portion states that future interest is awarded on the \"sums due\", it refers to the \"total amount of the award\", that is total of the amounts awarded on substantive claims (that is claims (1) to (7) of the contractor) excluding the claim relating interest.  Therefore, what was awarded by the Arbitrator was future interest at the rate of 18% per annum on the amounts awarded on various claims (that is Claim No.1 to 7) in all aggregating to Rs.14,94,000/- and not upon the interest awarded thereon upto to date of the award.  Hence, the Arbitral Award granted future interest from the date of award, only on the principal amount found due to the respondent (that is Rs.14,94,000/-) and not on the aggregate of the principal and interest upto the date of award (Rs.31,98,879/-).\t [Para 7,23]"

There is nothing in S.17(1), when read with the other provisions of the Act, to interdict the application of rules of arbitral institutions that the parties may have agreed to. This being the position, atleast insofar as S.17(1) is concerned, the \u201carbitral tribunal\u201d would,when institutional rules apply, include an Emergency Arbitrator, the context of S.17 \u201cotherwise requiring\u201d - the context being interim measures that are ordered by arbitrators. The same object and context would apply even to S.9(3) which makes it clear that the court shall not entertain an application for interim relief once an arbitral tribunal is constituted unless the court finds that circumstances exist which may not render the remedy provided under S.17 efficacious. Since S.9(3) and S.17 form part of one scheme, it is clear that an \u201carbitral tribunal\u201d as defined under S.2(1)(d) would not apply and the arbitral tribunal spoken of in S.9(3) would be like the \u201carbitral tribunal\u201d spoken of in S.17(1) which, would include an Emergency Arbitrator appointed under institutional rules. (Para 20)\n\nEven if Shareholders\u2019 Agreements between parties makes the SIAC Rules subject to the Arbitration Act, the said Act, properly construed, would include an Emergency Arbitrator\u2019s awards/orders, there being nothing inconsistent in the Arbitration Rules of Singapore International Arbitration Centre,(SIAC Rules) when read with the Act. (Para 22)\n\nRule 1.3 of theSIAC Rules indicates that an award of an Emergency Arbitrator is included within the ambit of these Rules, and that an Emergency Arbitrator, as defined, means an arbitrator appointed in accordance with paragraph 3 of Schedule 1. This makes it clear beyond doubt that \u201carbitration\u201d mentioned in Shareholders\u2019 Agreement would include an arbitrator appointed in accordance with the SIAC Rules which, in turn,would include an Emergency Arbitrator. (Para 23)\n\nAn Emergency Arbitrator\u2019s \u201caward\u201d, i.e., order, would undoubtedly bean order which furthers these very objectives, i.e., to decongest the court system and to give the parties urgent interim relief in cases which deserve such relief. Given the fact that party autonomy is respected by the Act and that there is otherwise no interdict against an Emergency Arbitrator being appointed, it is clear that an Emergency Arbitrator\u2019s order, which is exactly like an order of an arbitral tribunal once properly constituted, in that parties have to be heard and reasons are to be given, would fall within the institutional rules to which the parties have agreed, and would consequently be covered by Section 17(1), when read with the other provisions of the Act. (Para 35)\n\nA party cannot be heard to say, after it participates in an Emergency Award proceeding, having agreed to institutional rules made in that regard,that thereafter it will not be bound by an Emergency Arbitrator\u2019s ruling. Having agreed to paragraph 12 of Schedule 1 to the SIAC Rules, it cannot lie in the mouth of a party to ignore an Emergency Arbitrator\u2019s award by stating that it is a nullity when such party expressly agrees to the binding nature of such award from the date it is made and further undertakes to carry out the said interim order immediately and without delay. (Para 36)\n\nIt cannot be said that an Emergency Arbitrator under the SIAC Rules is not an independent judicial body like an arbitral tribunal constituted under the very Rules. Rule 3 merely states that the President may appoint an Emergency Arbitrator if he determines that the SIAC should accept the application for emergency interim relief. Once the Emergency Arbitrator enters upon the reference, he is given all the powers of an arbitral tribunal under Rule 7 and is to decide completely independently of any other administrative authority under the SIAC Rules. Equally, Rule 9 does not, in any manner, impinge upon the independence of the Emergency Arbitrator as it only lays down the time frame within which an interim order or award is to be made, which time is extendable by the Registrar. The interim order or award that is finally made by the Emergency Arbitrator has only to be approved by the Registrar as to its \u201cform\u201d and not on merits. Further, Rule 10 also does not, in any manner, interfere with the independence of the decision of the Emergency Arbitrator. (Para 37)\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 is a complete break with the past and is no longer to be viewed as an ouster statute but as a statute which favours the remedy of arbitration so as to de-clog civil courts which are, in today\u2019s milieu, extremely burdened. As a matter of fact, Section 5 of the Arbitration Act puts paid to the submission when it overrides all other laws for the time being in force and goes on to state that in matters governed by Part I of the Act, no judicial authority shall intervene except where so provided in that Part. The Arbitration Act, therefore, turns the principle of ouster on its head when it comes to arbitration as a favoured means of resolving civil disputes. (Para 38)\n\nNo party, after agreeing to be governed by institutional rules, can participate in a proceeding before an Emergency Arbitrator and, after losing, turn around and say that the award is a nullity or coram non judice when there is nothing in the Arbitration Act which interdicts an Emergency Arbitrator\u2019s order from being made. S.17, as construed in the light of the other provisions of the Act, clearly leads to the position that such emergency award is made under the provisions of S.17(1) and can be enforced under the provisions of S.17(2). (Para 40)\n\nFull party autonomy is given by the Arbitration Act to have a dispute decided in accordance with institutional rules which can include Emergency Arbitrators delivering interim orders, described as \u201cawards\u201d. Such orders are an important step in aid of decongesting the civil courts and affording expeditious interim relief to the parties. Such orders are referable to and are made under S.17(1). (Para 41)"

(Para 76)\n\nDespite S.17 being amended by the 2015 Amendment Act, by making S.17(1) the mirror image of S.9(1) as to the interim measures that can be made, and by adding S. 17(2) as a consequence thereof, significantly, no change was made in S.37(2)(b) to bring it in line with O.43, R.1(r). The said Section continued to provide appeals only from an order granting or refusing to grant any interim measure under S. 17. There can be no doubt that granting or refusing to grant any interim measure under S.17 would only refer to the grant or non-grant of interim measures under S.17(1)(i) and 17(1)(ii). In fact, the opening words of S.17(2), namely, \u201csubject to any orders passed in appeal under S.37\u2026\u201d also demonstrates the legislature\u2019s understanding that orders that are passed in an appeal under S. 37 are relatable only to S.17(1). For example, an appeal against an order refusing an injunction may be allowed, in which case sub-section (2) of S.17 then kicks in to enforce the order passed in appeal. Also, the legislature made no amendment to the granting or refusing to grant any measure under Section 9 to bring it in line with O.43, R. 1(r), under S.37(1)(b). What is clear from this is that enforcement proceedings are not covered by the appeal provision. (Para 74)"

Therefore, so far as Section 11(6) is concerned, if one party demands the opposite party to appoint an arbitrator and the opposite party does not make an appointment within 30 days of the demand, the right to appointment does not get automatically  forfeited after expiry of 30 days. If the opposite party makes an appointment even after 30 days of the demand, but before the first party has moved the Court under Section 11, that would be sufficient. In other words, in cases arising under Section 11(6), if the opposite party has not made an appointment within 30 days of demand, the right to make appointment is not forfeited but continues, but an appointment has to be made before the former files application under Section 11 seeking appointment of an arbitrator. Only then the right of the opposite party ceases.

                "description": "Bombay Stock Exchange Regulations, Reg. 249(a) (As it stood before 29-8-1998) - Byelaw providing for Arbitral Tribunal having even number of members - Byelaw is statutory byelaw and will not be hit by provisions of S.10 - It is saved by provisions of S.2(4).\n\n The Byelaw 249(a) framed by the Bombay Stock Exchange in exercise of powers under S.9 of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956 being a statutory byelaw is saved by the provisions of S.2(4) of Arbitration Act, 1996, and will prevail over the provisions of S.10 of the Act. Hence award passed by Arbitral Tribunal consisting of an even number of arbitrators as provided under the byelaw would be valid. The decision of the learned Single Judge taking a contrary view suffers from the following errors.\n\nThe foundational basis for the ratio of the impugned judgment is that \"bye-laws\" are not \"enactment\" or \"rules\" and that the saving clause of sub-section (4) of sec.2 of the 1996 Arbitration Act refers only to \"enactment\" and \"rules\" and not \"bye-laws\" and the Exchange's Bye-laws relating to arbitration are not therefore within the purview of the said section or saved thereby. The said finding is found to be erroneous for the following reasons.\n\nIt is contrary to the judgments reported in (I) 1995(2) Mah. L.J. 770, (ii) 1996(3) BCR 204 and (iii) the unreported judgment dated 10th December, 1997 of this Court in Arbitration petition No. 199 of 1991, all of which categorically held that the Exchange's said arbitration Bye-laws fall within the purview of and are saved by Section 46 of the 1940 Arbitration Act, which  is identical in material language to section 2(4) of the 1996 Act.\n\nIt is contrary to the judgments reported in (i) AIR 1943 Bom. 197 (which deals with Bye-laws under the Bombay Cotton Contracts Act, 1932) and (ii) AIR 1961 SC 1285 (which dealt with Bye-laws under the Forward Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1952) wherein it is held that \"byelaws\" under those respective Acts were saved by and/or fell within the purview of section 46 of the 1940 Act.\n\nThe impugned judgment has placed strong reliance upon the judgment reported in A.I.R. 1963 SC 274. The said judgment (a) does not relate to or consider the Exchange's Rules, Bye-laws or Regulations, (b) does not relate to or consider the old or new Arbitration Acts.\n\nEven otherwise the said judgment reported in A.I.R. 1963 Supreme Court 274 supports the contentions of the Exchange in that the Supreme Court in paragraphs 15 and 16 has held :-\n\n(a) that bye-laws are subordinate legislation (under the Act.)\n\n(b) that bye-laws are rules made ...and they would therefore squarely fall within the words \"under the Act\". Thus the Supreme Court has equated bye-laws with rules.  [Para 31]\n\nThe impugned judgment unsettles the settled legal position which course, in our view, was wholly unnecessary. In fact, the Apex Court has made it clear in the case of Kattite Valappil Pathumma and others Vs. Talukland Board and others (1997) 4 Supreme Court Cases 114) that even if two views were possible, things which have been adjudged long ago should be allowed to rest in peace. The decisions which have been rendered by this Court since 1943, took a consistent view and the law laid down by this Court in those decisions was never doubted. Merely because another view is possible, assuming that was so in this case, the Apex Court has clearly ruled that  such a recourse is not permissible in law. Interpretation of law is not a mere mental exercise. Decision in Arb. Pet. No. 130/1998 dt. 7-9-1998 (Bom) (1999(2) ALL MR 129) Reversed.  [Para 44]"

Merely because a large number of disputes were raised cannot be a ground for holding otherwise.  [Para 27]\n\nThe Act makes it clear that parties can derogate from the provisions of the Act when it is so provided. If in a contract the parties have agreed to an odd number of arbitrators, then that clause is saved by virtue of Section 10(1) of the 1996 Act. It the contract provided for an even number of arbitrators then such a clause in the contract would be void being contrary to sub-section (1) of Section 10. In the case of B.S.E. contract between a member and non-member it provides for arbitration by the Arbitrators and the resolution in case of a difference by an umpire. Exfacie this clause would be contrary to Section 10(1) of the 1996 Act as parties cannot derogate from the contract unless it is held that Section 10(1) itself will not apply to such contract as the Bye-laws framed under Section 9 of the Securities Contract Act would prevail.

Bye-laws cannot override the statutory provisions. In the instant case Section 10 of the Act. Once it is so held it is clear that those provisions pertaining to arbitration agreement which are under any enactment or rules are saved. They cannot be said to be inconsistent to prevail over the provisions of the Arbitration Act 1996.

Overruled.\n\nPer P. K. Balasubramanyan, J. (For himself and on behalf of R. C. Lahoti C.J.I., B. N. Agarwal, Arun Kumar, G. M. Mathur, A. K. Mathur, JJ.:-  We sum up our conclusions as follows :-\n\n(i)\tThe power exercised by the Chief Justice of the High Court or the Chief Justice of India under Section 11(6) of the Act is not an administrative power. It is a judicial power.\n\n(ii)\tThe power under Section 11(6) of the Act, in its entirety, could be delegated, by the Chief Justice of the High Court only to another judge of that court and by the Chief Justice of India to another judge of the Supreme Court.\n\n(iii)\tIn case of designation of a judge of the High Court or of the Supreme Court, the power that is exercised by the designated, judge would be that of the Chief Justice as conferred by the statute.\n\n(iv)\tThe Chief Justice or the designated judge will have the right to decide the preliminary, aspects as indicated in the earlier part of this judgment. These will be, his own jurisdiction, to entertain the request, the existence of a valid arbitration agreement, the existence or otherwise of a live claim, the existence of the condition for the exercise of his power and on the qualifications of the arbitrator or arbitrators. The Chief Justice or the judge designated would be entitled to seek the opinion of an institution in the matter of nominating an arbitrator qualified in terms of Section 11(8) of the Act if the need arises but the order appointing the arbitrator could only be that of the Chief Justice or the judge designate.\n\n(v)\tDesignation of a district judge as the authority under Section 11(6) of the Act by the Chief Justice of the High Court is not warranted on the scheme of the Act.\n\n(vi)\tOnce the matter reaches the arbitral tribunal or the sole arbitrator, the High Court would not interfere with orders passed by the arbitrator or the arbitral tribunal during the course of the arbitration proceedings and the parties could approach the court only in terms of Section 37 of the Act or in terms of Section 34 of the Act.\n\n(vii)\tSince an order passed by the Chief Justice of the High Court or by the designated judge of that court is a judicial order, an appeal will lie against that order only under Article 136 of the Constitution of India to the Supreme Court.\n\n(viii)\tThere can be no appeal against an order of the Chief Justice of India or a judge of the Supreme Court designated by him while entertaining an application under Section 11(6) of the Act.\n\n(ix)\tIn a case where an arbitral tribunal has been constituted by the parties without having recourse to Section 11(6) of the Act, the arbitral tribunal will have the jurisdiction to decide all matters as contemplated by Section 16 of the Act.\n\n(x)\tSince all were guided by the decision of this Court in Konkan Railway Corpn. Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Rani Construction Pvt. Ltd. [(2002)2 SCC 388) : 2002(2) ALL MR 232 (S.C.)] and orders under Section 11(6) of the Act have been made based on  the position adopted in that decision, we clarify that appointments of arbitrators or arbitral tribunals thus far made, are to be treated as valid, all objections being left to be decided under Section 16 of the Act. As and from this date, the position as adopted in this judgment will govern even pending applications under Section 11(6) of the Act.\n\n(xi)\tWhere District Judges had been designated by the Chief Justice of the High Court under Section 11(6) of the Act, the appointment orders thus far made by them will be treated as valid; but applications if any pending before them as on this date will stand transferred, to be dealt with by the Chief Justice of the concerned High Court or a Judge of that court designated by the Chief Justice.\n\n(xii)\tThe decision in Konkan Railway Corpn. Ltd. & Anr. Vs. Rani Construction Pvt. Ltd. [(2002)2 SCC 388) : 2002(2) ALL MR 232 (S.C.)] is overruled.  \n\nMinority view (Per C. K. Thakker, J.):-  My conclusions are as under :-\n\n(i)\tThe function performed by the Chief Justice of the High Court or the Chief Justice of India under sub-section (6) of Section 11 of the Act (i.e. Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996) is administrative, - pure and simple-, and neither judicial nor quasi-judicial.\n\n(ii)\tThe function to be performed by the Chief Justice under sub-section (6) of Section 11 of the Act may be performed by him or by 'any person or institution designated by him'.\n\n(iii)\tWhile performing the function under sub-section (6) of Section 11 of the Act the Chief Justice should be prima facie satisfied that the conditions laid down in Section 11 are satisfied.\n\n(iv)\tThe Arbitral Tribunal has power and jurisdiction to rule 'on its own jurisdiction' under sub-section (1) of Section 16 of the Act.\n\n(v)\tWhere the Arbitral Tribunal holds that it has jurisdiction, it shall continue with the arbitral proceedings and make an arbitral award. (vi)  A remedy available to the party aggrieved is to challenge the award in accordance with Section 34 or Section 37 of the Act.\n\n(vii)\tSince the order passed by the Chief Justice under sub-section (6) of Section 11 of the Act is administrative, a Writ Petition under Article 226 of the Constitution is maintainable. A Letters Patent Appeal/Intra-Court Appeal is competent. A Special Leave Petition under Article 136 of the Constitution also lies to this Court.\n\n(viii)\tWhile exercising extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 of the Constitution, however, the High Court will be conscious and mindful of the relevant provisions of the Act, including Sections 5, 16, 34 to 37 as also the object of the legislation and exercise its power with utmost care, caution and circumspection.\n\n(ix)\tThe decision of the Constitution Bench in Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. (II), to the extent that it held the function of the Chief Justice under sub-section (6) of Section 11 of the Act as administrative is in consonance with settled legal position and lays down correct law on the point.\n\n(x)\tThe decision of the Constitution Bench in Konkan Railway Corporation Ltd. (II), to the extent that it held clause 7 of \"The Appointment of Arbitrators by the Chief justice of India Scheme, 1996\" providing for issuance of notice to affected parties as 'beyond the term of Section 11' and bad on that ground is not in accordance with law and does not state the legal position correctly.\n\n(xi)\tSince the Chief Justice is performing administrative function in appointing an Arbitral Tribunal, there is no 'duty to act judicially' on his part.  The doctrine of 'duty to act fairly', however, applies and the Chief Justice must issue notice to the person or persons likely to be affected by the decision under sub-section (6) of Section 11 of the Act.\n\n(xii)\tAll appointments of Arbitral Tribunals so far made without issuing notice to the parties affected are held legal and valid. Henceforth, however, every appointment will be made after issuing notice to such person or persons. In other words, this judgment will have prospective operation and it will not affect past appointments or concluded proceedings.\n\nPara 147"

                "description": "Arbitration - 'Arbitration agreement' - What is - Clause in Work Order - Omission of words 'arbitration,' 'award,' and 'arbitrator,' not a ground to hold it as not arbitration agreement- Essentials are whether parties intended to make a reference to an arbitration and treat the decision of the arbitrator as final.\n\nThe definition of arbitration agreement clearly shows that an arbitration agreement is not required to be in any particular form. What is required to be ascertained is whether the parties have agreed that if any dispute arises between them in respect of the subject matter of the contract, such dispute shall be referred to arbitration. In that case such agreement would certainly spell out an arbitration agreement. However, from the definition of the arbitration agreement, it is also clear that the agreement must be in writing and to interpret the agreement as an 'arbitration agreement' one has to ascertain the intention of the parties and also treatment of the decision as final. If the parties had desired and intended that a dispute must be referred to arbitration for decision and they would undertake to abide by that decision, there cannot be any difficulty to hold that the intention of the parties to have an arbitration agreement; that is to say, an arbitration agreement immediately comes into existence.   [Para 8]\n\nThe Clause 4 of the Work Order in this case categorically mentions the word 'any dispute' which would be referred to the Superintending Engineer (SE) and states 'his decision would be final and acceptable / binding on both the parties.' The use of words is not restricted to the scope of the contract. Obviously, such decision can be reached by SE only when it is referred to him by either party for decision. The reference is also implied. As SE will decide the matter on reference, there cannot be any doubt that he has to act judicially and decide the dispute after hearing both the parties and permitting them to state their claim by adducing materials in support. Although the expression 'award' or 'arbitration' does not appear in the Clause even then such expression as it stands in the Clause embodies an arbitration clause which can be enforced. The Clause can safely be interpreted to be an arbitration agreement even though the term 'arbitration' is not expressly mentioned in the agreement. Therefore, the Clause 4 of the Work Order constitutes an arbitration agreement and if any dispute arises, such dispute shall be referred to SE for decision which shall be binding on the parties. 1996(2) SCC 216 - Distinguished.\t\t\t\t  [Para 14,17,19,20]"

The scheme was framed in the year 1996 principally along with the Arbitration Act which is brought into force on 28.08.1996. The scheme so referred has been framed even before the Arbitration Act was brought into force. There is no other provision under the Act which deals with the payment of costs for processing request and/or even for the Court Fees Act- Central as well as State Act provide for requisite Court Fees and/or process fee for filing any application in the Court and/or before the appropriate forum.\n\nWhen the scheme was framed it was probably on the foundation that the order would be administrative order and therefore certain costs or process fee is required to be paid by the applicant. But now if it is a judicial order [in view of 2006(1) ALL MR 156 (S.C.)] and even otherwise, parties are entitled to invoke S.11 of the Arbitration Act, the requisite court fee and/or process fee need to be paid and/or deposited by the parties as per the respective rules. The question is requirement of direction to deposit the costs for processing.\n\nSection 89 of Code of Civil Procedure also provides for appointment of Arbitrator by Court being one of the alternative mode of settlement of dispute pending in the Court. There is nothing to show that such costs and/or process fee is required to be paid by the parties in those proceedings. Though scheme is different yet, the costs for processing for appointment of Arbitrator under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act is not contemplated under the Arbitration Act and/or even under the Court Fee Act and/or any specific rules except the Scheme of 1996, which had been framed prior to the judgment in S.B.P. & Co.case and not amended till date. \n\nHowever, it is made clear that as on today, unless pointed out otherwise and as there is no challenge at any point of time to the orders passed by the Court directing the parties to deposit the process fee and as most of the parties have complied it, it cannot be said that the same is illegal and/or impermissible. However, an immediate attention is required from all sources to bring in force common scheme and/or rules to avoid further complications in the matter apart from delay in constituting the Tribunal for want of deposit of such process fee.\n\n2006(1) ALL MR 156 (S.C.)

Subclause (a) provides that the decreetal money has to be deposited in Court or by postal money order or through Bank. Clause(b) provides that amount, if paid out of court, then it has to be by postal money order or through Bank or by any mode where payment is evidenced in writing. If the payment is made under clause(b) then clause(c) prescribes the procedure as to how the money has to be paid and what details are required to be given by the judgment debtor in support of making payment.\n\n\tOrder 21 Rule 2 of the Code deals with the cases where the judgment debtor makes the payment of decreetal amount either full or part out of the Court to the decree holder. Sub-clause(1) empowers the decree holder to apply to the executing Court to get the amount received from the judgment debtor certified from the Court and it is only when the Court certifies the amount to have been paid, it can be adjusted against the decreetal sum. Clause(2) empowers the judgment debtor to apply to the executing Court and get the certification done by the Court of the amount paid by them to the decree holder after notice to the decree holder. Rule 2(A) provides that no payment made by the judgment debtor shall be adjusted unless he ensures compliance of sub clause (a) or (b) or (c). Rule 3 provides that if the Court does not certify the payment made by the judgment debtor then such payment shall not be recognized by any Court executing the decree for the purpose of giving adjustment to the judgment debtor against the decretal amount.\n\n\tKeeping in view the mandatory requirements of Order 21 Rules 1 and 2 relating to payment of decretal dues made by the judgment debtor and applying the said provisions to the undisputed facts of this case, held that the sum of Rs.3,37,885/- which the respondents claimed to have paid to the appellant towards the decretal sum and which found acceptance to the two Courts below could never have been regarded as the payment made by the respondents to the appellant in conformity with the requirements of either Rule 1 or Rule 2 of Order 21. It is not in dispute that such payment was never certified by the Court as contemplated under Rule 2 of Order 21 at the instance of respondents or at the instance of the appellant. Indeed, there was neither any evidence to prove the factum of payment except one copy of the statement which also remained unproved nor any evidence was led to prove the certification done by the Court as required under Order 21 Rule 2 so as to recognize making of such payment by the respondents to the appellant Hence, order rejecting execution application holding that respondents have already made payment of decretal amount, set aside.\t\t [Para 34,35,36]"

                "description": "Applicability of S.14 to arbitration proceedings - By virtue of S.29(2) provisions of Limitation Act stand excluded to proceedings under Arbitration Act to the extent area is covered by Arbitration Act - No provision in Arbitration Act excludes operation of S.14 of Limitation Act - Hence applicability of S.14 cannot be excluded.\n\nThe prohibitory provision has to be construed strictly. It is true that the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 intended to expedite the commercial issue expeditiously. It is also clear from the statement of objects and reasons that in order to recognize economic reforms the settlement of both of domestic & international commercial disputes should be disposed of quickly so that country's economic progress be expedited. The statement of objects and reasons also nowhere indicate that Section 14 of the Limitation Act shall be excluded. But on the contrary intendment of legislature is apparent in the present case as Section 43 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 applies the Limitation Act, 1963 as a whole. It is only by virtue of sub-section (2) of section 29 of the Limitation Act, its operation is excluded to that extent of the area which is covered under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. By virtue of sub-section (2) of section 29 of the Limitation Act that the provisions of Limitation Act shall stand excluded in Act of 1996 to the extent area which is covered by the Act of 1996. In the present case under section 34 by virtue of sub-section 3 only the application for filing and setting aside the award a period has been prescribed as 3 months and delay can be condoned to the extent of 30 days. To this extent the applicability of section 5 of Limitation will stand excluded but there is no provision in the Act of 1996 which excludes operation of section 14 of the Limitation Act. If two Acts can be read harmoniously without doing violation to the words used therein, then there is no prohibition in doing so. The view taken by the court below excluding the applicability of Section 14 in this proceeding is not correct. \t\t [Para 27]"

An useful reference can be made to the scope of Indian Limitation Act.  This (Act) primarily applies to suits, appeals and applications and it has in term no application to the \"arbitration proceedings\" as it is not a suit. Section 3 of the Limitation Act provides that subject to the provisions contained in Sections 4 to 24 (inclusive) every suit instituted, appeal preferred, and applications made after the prescribed period shall be dismissed although the limitation has not been set up as defence.  The proceeding before the Arbitrator/s is not a suit, appeal or application and in terms of Section 3 can have no application thereto. To overcome this aspect, Section 43 is incorporated in the Act. Expiry of the period of limitation prescribed for a suit does not destroy the right : it only bars the remedy for enforcement of a right in a Court of law.  It cannot, therefore, be said that the provisions of the Limitation Act prevent an arbitrator/s or Arbitral Tribunal from adjudicating upon the claim which if brought before the Court of law may be barred by limitation, but it may proceed to consider at times even to entertain a claim which is barred by period of limitation.  Therefore, the arbitral proceedings are not suit and the arbitral Tribunal is not a Court.  By Section 43 of the Act, the provisions of Limitation Act are made applicable to the arbitrations. The proceedings before the Arbitrator and the proceedings before the Court u/s.34 cannot be equated and, therefore, Section 43 cannot be taken help of in construing Section 34 (3) of the Act.  [Para 20,21]\n\nThe provisions of Section 43 of the Act are only attracted to the proceedings before the arbitrators and the proceedings under section 34 of the Act are not the proceedings which are referred to under Section 43 of the Act. The Arbitrator before whom the proceedings were brought the claims which were barred by limitation have to be dismissed and for that purpose section 43 is to be construed and interpreted.  Therefore, the contention of Shri. Vayal that by virtue of Section 43 of the Act, the provisions of the Limitation Act are attracted in the application u/s.34, being without any substance, has to be rejected. [Para 22]"

It starts from the creation of the Trust, how it is required to be created (deed), who can create (author of the Trust/settlor), who can manage (trustees), for whose benefit it can be created (beneficiaries), their qualifications for appointment, grounds for removal, rights and duties, restrictions on their exercise of powers, obligations and legal remedies available to get the grievances settled etc. are all specified in the Trust Act. \t [Para 53]\n\n\tSo far as legal remedies available to the author of the Trust/settlor, Trustees and the beneficiaries for ventilating their several grievances in respect of their rights duties, removal and obligations under the Trust Deed and the Trust Act are concerned, they are specifically provided in Sections 7, 11, 34, 36, 41, 45, 46, 49, 53, 71, 72, 73 and 74 of the Trust Act. These sections, in specific terms, confer jurisdiction on Civil Court and provides that an aggrieved person may approach the principal Civil Court of Original Jurisdiction for adjudication of his grievances. This clearly shows the intention of the legislature that the legislature intended to confer jurisdiction only on Civil Court for deciding the disputes arising under the Trust Act. \t  [Para 54]\n\n\tOn examining the Scheme of the Trust Act, found no difficulty in concluding that though the Trust Act do not provide any express bar in relation to applicability of other Acts for deciding the disputes arising under the Trust Act yet, there exists an implied bar of exclusion of applicability of the Arbitration Act for deciding the disputes relating to Trust, trustees and beneficiaries through private arbitration. \t  [Para 58]\n\n\tThe principle of interpretation that where a specific remedy is given, it thereby deprives the person who insists upon a remedy of any other form of remedy than that given by the statute, is applicable. Since sufficient and adequate remedy is provided under the Trust Act for deciding the disputes in relation to Trust Deed, Trustees and beneficiaries, the remedy provided under the Arbitration Act for deciding such disputes is barred by implication. \t\t\t [Para 59]"

Indeed, the language of Rule 3(3) does not preclude the Competent Authority to revoke the suspension order in earlier point of time, if the fact situation of the case so warrants.

In that sense, the successive orders issued by the Authority are not in conformity with the mandate of Rule 3(3). Therefore, the same will have to be treated as non est in the eye of law, as it was not open to the Authority to specify suspension period lesser than the period mentioned in Rule 3(3). In cases covered under Rule 3(3), review of suspension for extension of the suspension period is not envisaged at all. Inasmuch as, the suspension of member of the Service, is, in law, made co-terminus with the termination of all proceedings relating to the stated criminal charge against him. The only other possibility is revocation of the original suspension order by the Competent Authority before the termination of all proceedings relating to the stated criminal charge against the official. In other words, the mandate of Rule 3(3) gives no other option to the Competent Authority but to place the official concerned under suspension until termination of proceedings relating to stated criminal charge pending against him.

However, Section 49(3) of FEMA provides that the adjudicating officer can initiate proceedings under FEMA in respect  of the alleged contravention of FERA provided the adjudicating officer takes notice of the said contravention on or before 31/05/2002.  In the present case, on the basis of the materials placed by the enforcement officer, the adjudicating officer formed a prima facie opinion that the petitioners have contravened the provisions of FERA and decided to issue a show-cause notice to the petitioners under Rule 3(1) of the Appeal Rules. It is not in dispute that the show-cause notice was in fact prepared and signed by the adjudicating officer on  31-5-2002. The question is, whether signing of the show-cause notice amounts to taking notice under Section 49(3) of FEMA ?   The adjudication proceedings under Section 51 of FERA read with Rule 3 of the Appeal Rules framed under FERA consists of two stages. First stage is, when the adjudicating officer forms a prima facie  opinion the basis of the materials placed before him, that a person has contravened the provisions of FERA and accordingly issues a notice (first notice) calling upon that person to show cause within such period as may be specified (being not less than ten days from the date of service thereof) as to why adjudication proceedings should not be held against him. The second stage is, when the adjudicating officer after  considering the cause if any shown by such person forms an opinion that the adjudication proceedings should be continued and accordingly issues a notice (second notice) in respect of the alleged contravention of  FERA by fixing a date for the appearance of that person either personally or through his representative. In the present case, the show cause notice dated 31-5-2002 is the first stage notice. The question is, whether the adjudicating officer can be said to have taken notice of the alleged contravention of FERA on 31/05/2002 ?  The first notice issued under Rule 3(1) is a show cause notice, which requires the notice to show cause as to why adjudication proceedings should not be initiated for the alleged contravention of FERA. Rule 3(2) requires that the show cause notice issued under Rule 3(1) must indicate the nature of the offence allegedly committed under FERA. Unless the adjudicating officer forms a prima facie opinion that the provisions of FERA have been violated, he cannot issue a show cause notice calling upon the notice to show cause as to why adjudication proceedings should not be held for the alleged contravention of FERA. Since the first notice is the foundation for initiating adjudication proceedings, the adjudicating officer cannot issue the first notice casually or without forming a prima facie opinion that the provisions of the FERA have been contravened. Therefore, the words take notice in Section 49(3) of FEMA is referable to the prima facie opinion formed before issuance of the first notice under Rule 3(1) of the Appeal Rules.\n\nThe opinion formed before issuance of the first notice relates to forming a prima facie belief on the basis of the materials placed that a person has contravened the provisions of FERA and the opinion formed after the first notice relates to sustaining the earlier prima facie belief even after considering the cause if any shown by the noticee. Therefore, it is reasonable to hold that it is only when the adjudicating officer takes notice of the alleged contravention of FERA he issues first notice under Rule 3(1) of Appeal Rules.\t [Para 21,25]"

In other words, in criminal proceedings 'taking cognizance' by a Magistrate would mean taking notice of the offence judicially and issue further process. Similarly, in adjudication proceedings the adjudicating officer on taking notice of the alleged contravention of FERA initiates adjudication proceedings through the process of issuing show-cause notice under rule 3(1) of the Appellate Rules. In criminal proceedings, the Magistrate even after taking cognizance of the alleged offence has the option of ordering the police to investigate the offence under Section 156(3) of the Criminal Procedure Code, where as, the adjudicating officer is not conferred with such power because the two proceedings stand on different footing. Therefore, hen the legislature has specifically provided different modes for conducting the criminal proceedings and the adjudication proceedings, it would not be proper to construe the words take notice in adjudication proceedings ejusdem generis with the words take cognizance in the criminal proceedings, so as to hold that the notice under Rule 3(1) amounts to issuing notice for further investigation without taking notice of the alleged contravention of FERA. Once the show cause notice is issued under Rule 3(1) there is no scope for making any further investigation and the adjudicating officer on considering the cause, if any, shown by the noticee has to form an opinion, either to drop the adjudication proceedings or continue with the adjudication proceeding and issue notice accordingly.

The fact that the said notice was posted on 05/06/2002 and served upon on 06/06/2002 would not invalidate the proceedings initiated by show cause notice dated 31/05/2002, because for the purpose of Section 49(3) of FEMA what is relevant is 'taking notice' and not issuance or service of notice. \t [Para 31]"

It has, therefore, to be noted that the word \"misconduct\" is not capable of precise definition. But at the same time though incapable of precise definition, the word \"misconduct\" on reflection receives its connotation from the context, the delinquency in performance and its effect on the discipline and the nature of the duty. The act complained of must bear a forbidden quality or character and its ambit has to be construed with reference to the subject-matter and the context wherein the term occurs, having regard to the scope of the statute and the public purpose it seeks to serve. Held, it was evident from record that the prescribed period for filing property return was six months and though appellant was aware of the requirement he did not choose to file any return, even during the course of enquiry no return was filed and ultimately after show cause notice was issued it was filed. That being so there was no merit in this appeal which was accordingly dismissed.  [Para 8,16]"

In that, he was granted casual leave from 20th October, 2012 to 4th November, 2012, but he surrendered only on 11th April, 2014. He did not bother to intimate his whereabouts either to his superiors or to the nearest military station during the intervening period stretched upto around 1\u00bd years. If he was suffering from any illness personally or for that matter if his father suffered a paralytic attack, he ought to have gone to the Military Hospital for treatment. However, he did not choose to go to the Military Hospital but to a quack. This is a serious misconduct and cannot be countenanced in the disciplined force where the respondent was serving. From the established facts it would not warrant a lighter view, much less to direct reinstatement of the respondent, as has been done by the Tribunal. That would send a wrong signal and impact the discipline of the Armed Forces. The respondent had just put in around six years of service when he ventured into committing the stated offence. The fact that he has already undergone punishment of sentence period for the offence of desertion also can be of no avail so as to interdict the decision of the disciplinary authority to dismiss the respondent from service. The Tribunal misdirected itself in invoking Regulation 754(C) and to reckon the mitigating circumstance such as respondent has already undergone punishment of sentence for the stated offence. Thus, the Tribunal exceeded its jurisdiction in overturning the order of punishment imposed by the disciplinary authority and instead directing reinstatement of the respondent in service and treating the period between the date of dismissal of the respondent and the date of his rejoining service as non-qualifying service, so as to give him a chance of rehabilitation in service. However, Supreme Court to do complete justice instead of setting aside order of reinstatement modified order of dismissal from service to one of discharge from service simplicitor. \t [Para 8,9,10,11,12]"

The lawyers, straight after their enrolment, who join the legal profession with high hopes and expectations and dedicate their whole lives to the professions, are the real deservers. Lawyers who enroll themselves after their retirement from government services and continue to receive pension and other terminal benefits, who basically join this field in search of greener pastures in the evening of their lives cannot and should not be equated with those who have devoted their whole lives to the profession. For these retired persons, some amount of financial stability is ensured in view of the pension and terminal benefits and making them eligible for lump sum welfare fund under the Act would actually amount to double benefits. Therefore, the classification of lawyers into these two categories is a reasonable classification having a nexus with the object of the Act.\n\n Furthermore, it is also to be noted that in view of their being placed differently than the class of lawyers who chose this profession as the sole means of their livelihood, it can reasonably be discerned that the retired persons form a separate class. As the object of the Act is to provide for the constitution of a Welfare Fund for the benefit of advocates on cessation of practice. As per Section 3 (2) (d) of Tamil Nadu Act, any grant made by the Government to the welfare fund is one of the source of the Advocates' Welfare Fund. The retired employees are already in receipt of pension from the Government or other employer and to make them get another retiral benefit from the Advocates' Welfare Fund would amount to double benefit and they are rightly excluded from the benefit of the lump sum amount of welfare fund. \t [Para 28,29]"

The legislature has made the aforesaid position clear by making a specific provision in this regard namely. Section 22 in the Act and sub-section (1) thereof lays down that it shall not be obligatory on the part of the employer to offer any employment to any apprentice who has completed the period of his apprenticeship training. Sub-section (2) however provides that notwithstanding anything in sub-section (1) where there is a condition in a contract of apprenticeship that apprentice shall, after successful completion of apprenticeship training, serve the employer, the employer shall, on such completion, be bound to offer suitable employment to the apprentice, and the apprentice shall be bound to serve the employer in that capacity for such period and on such remuneration as may be specified in the contract. Thus the provisions of the Act and the Rules made thereunder show that in absence of any condition in the contract which is entered into between the employer and the apprentice at the time of commencement of his apprenticeship training and which is registered with the Apprenticeship Adviser to the effect that the apprentice shall serve the employer, an apprentice cannot claim any right to get an employment on successful completion of his training. It is not the case of the respondent no.1 that in the contract of apprenticeship there was any condition that after completion of training he would serve the employer and in absence of such a condition, the employer namely the appellants are not bound to offer any employment to them. In absence of any legal right inhering in the writ petitioner (respondent no.1 herein) no writ of mandamus could be issued commanding the appellants to give an appointment to him on the post of welder.  \t\t [Para 7]"

Therefore, it can be said that Admiral Superintendent could not supersede DM 6/85, which was issued with approval of the Head Quarter's office, by any order or instructions, which did not have such approval from the Head Quarter's office. In view of this, it may be held that the supersession of DM 6 of 85 was not valid, atleast in respect of apprentices, who had entered into apprenticeship contract when DM 6/85 was in force. Therefore, even if subsequent DTMs could be valid in respect of persons joining as apprentices after issuance of these DTMs, such DTM could not be given retrospective effect in respect of apprentices, who had already joined when DM 6/85 was in force.

It is well established that general law cannot defeat a provision of special law to the extent to which they are in conflict; else effort has to be made on reconciling the two provisions by homogeneous reading. In the present case, the provisions of section 37 (the relevant portion of which is pari materia relevant portion of section 39 of 1940 Act) leave no manner of doubt that the provisions of the special enactment will prevail over the general law namely, the 1908 Code. The Statutory Scheme of 1996 Act and the Letters Patent and the binding precedents of Supreme Court and this Court lead to only one conclusion that clause 15 of the Letters Patent are impliedly excluded by the 1996 Act.\n\nAnother way of looking at this aspect is the question as to what would be effect of holding that a Letters Patent Appeal is maintainable in juxta position to the scheme of the 1996 Act. Under section 2(e) of the 1996 Act, the term \"court\" is defined. As per the definition, in Mumbai, the High Court is the Court which is the principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction for the geographical area of Greater Mumbai which consists of 2 districts namely, Mumbai and Mumbai suburban. In other districts by virtue of definition of the term \"principal Civil Court of original jurisdiction\" given in the Bombay Civil Courts Act 1862, the respective district courts would be \"courts\" under section 2(e) of the 1996 Act. If it is held that the Letters Patent Appeal is maintainable, when an order in proceedings under section 36 of the 1996 Act is passed by a Single Judge of High Court, a Letters Patent Appeal will lie to the Division Bench whereas if an order is passed by the District Court outside Mumbai and Mumbai suburban district, no appeal would be maintainable either under the 1996 Act or under the Civil Procedure Code.\n\nIf the aforesaid interpretation is accepted it would lead to a piquant situation where if an order in proceeding under section 36 is passed by Single Judge of High Court, the same will become appealable whereas an order passed by the Judge of the District Court will not be appealable.\n\n2011 (7) SCALE 513; 1961 SCR 497; (1993) 3 SCC 1; (2002) 5 SCC 510; (2001) 8 SCC 470; (2002) 4 SCC 447; 1994 (3) BOM.C.R. 139; 2002 (5) BOM.C.R. 567 Rel. on.

The condition precedent for grant of leave to withdraw appearance by an Advocate is that a written intimation of his intention to do so has to be served on the client atleast 7 days in advance. The requirement of giving intimation will not obviously apply when the client himself instructs in writing to the Advocate to withdraw his appearance. Therefore, the practice adopted by the Civil Courts of treating the act of filing a \"no instruction pursis\" by an Advocate as discharge of the Advocate has to be deprecated being in contravention of the express provisions of the said Code and the Rules framed by this Court in exercise of powers under section 34 of the said Act of 1961.  Even if \"no instruction pursis\" is filed by an Advocate, he continues to act as an Advocate till his appointment is determined with the leave of the Court.   [Para 15]\n\nIn the facts of the present case all that is stated in the pursis filed by the Advocate is that on the date on which the suit appeared before the Court the Defendant No.1 had not come to the Court and therefore, on that day the Advocate did not have instructions to proceed. The pursis has been filed by the Advocate very cautiously by mentioning that on that day his client had not come to the Court and therefore, on that day he was not in position to conduct the case on behalf of his client.  It appears that the trial Court proceeded on the erroneous assumption that the filing of the said pursis will operate as discharge of the Advocate and therefore, an observation has been made in order that the Advocate has retired.

                "description": "Appointment of Pleader - Vakalatnama filed by an Advocate - Cannot be withdrawn without prior permission of the Court - Filing of no instructions pursis by Advocate - Would not automatically discharge the advocate representing the client.\n\nOnce Advocate files his Vakalatnama, the same continues to be in force till he obtains leave of the Court to withdrawn his vakalatnama.  The Rules framed by this Court in exercise of power under section 34(1) of the Advocates Act, 1961, lay down the procedure for withdrawal of appearance by an Advocate.  Rule 8(4) of the said Rules provides that when an Advocate who has filed a vakalatnama for a party wishes to withdraw his appearance he shall serve a written notice of his intention to do so on his client at least seven days in advance of the case coming up for hearing before the Court.  The Rule further provides that the Advocate shall file a note in writing requesting the Court for permission to withdraw appearance and shall also file along with the Note the letter of the client instructing him to withdraw his appearance or a copy of the intimation given to the client as above together with its written acknowledgment by the client.  After such note in writing is filed and if the Court is satisfied that no inconvenience is likely to be caused to the Court or the client, the Court may permit the Advocate to withdraw his vakalatnama.  In view of the provisions of the said Code and the Rules, no Advocate can withdraw his Vakalatnama without obtaining leave of the Court.  Till such time leave is not granted the Advocate concerned continues to represent his client.\t [Para 7]\n\nIn the present case, it is obvious that the mandatory procedure laid down by the aforesaid Rules has not been followed.  There is nothing on record to show that before filing no instruction pursis, the Advocate had given any intimation in writing to the Appellants.  It is not a case where the Appellant had intimated to the Advocate to withdraw his appearance.  It is not reflected from the order that the Appellant Court granted leave to the Advocate to withdraw his appearance.  An Advocate cannot simply walk out of a proceeding only by filing such no instruction pursis.  He owes a duty to his client to appear for him in the proceedings till his appointment is terminated by an order of the Court.  In view of the express provisions of the said Code and the Rules framed by High Court, the vakalatnama of the Advocate continues until leave is granted by the Court concerned in favour of the Advocate to withdraw his vakalatnama.  When the appeal preferred by the Appellant was fixed for hearing and the Advocate who was supposed to argue the Appeal was present, the Court could not have dismissed the appeal for default only on the basis of the no instruction pursis filed by the Advocate.  If the Court intended to treat no instruction pursis as an application for discharge, the Court ought to have directed the Advocate to give intimation in writing to his client as required by Rules.  If the Court intended to grant discharge to the Advocate, notice to the Appellant ought to have been issued by the Court after accepting the no instruction pursis.  Therefore, the appeal ought not to have been dismissed for default on filing of such pursis. In the circumstances, a case is made out for restoration of the appeal. [Para 8,10]"

The first refers to legal practitioners who are authorized to practise law and the second refers to \"any other person\". If it is the latter, its essential requisite is that such person should have been appointed with the permission of the Court to act in such proceedings. This is in tune with Section 32 of the Advocates Act, 1961 which empowers a Court to permit any person, who is not enrolled as an Advocate, to appear before it in any particular case. But if he is to represent another person in a criminal Court, such permission should be sought for by that person. It is not necessary that the \"pleader\" so appointed should be the power of attorney holder of a party in the case. What seems to be a condition precedent is that his appointment should have been preceded by grant of permission of the Court. It is for the court to consider whether such permission is necessary in the given case.  [Para 6]\n\nUnder Section 205 of the Code, an accused is required to appear in person but his personal appearance can be dispensed with and he can be allowed to be represented by a pleader. Likewise, under Section 302 of the Code, a person, who is entitled to continue the prosecution, is required to make an application himself but under both the provisions aforesaid, instead of taking steps personally, a party can be represented through a pleader. Power of attorney holder can represent the concerned party under both the provisions of the Code, in case permission for such representation is sought from the Court by the concerned person and granted by it. But where no such permission is sought by the concerned person, meaning thereby, in the case of Section 205 of the Code - an accused and in the case of Section 302 of the Code - a party who has right to continue the prosecution, power of attorney holder cannot be allowed to represent the concerned person in the proceeding. [Para 9]\n\nIn the present case, neither heirs of the complainant filed petition under Section 302 of the Code to continue the prosecution nor any permission was sought by them from the competent Court that they should be allowed to continue the prosecution through their power of attorney holders, rather the prayer was made by the power of attorney holders, which is not permissible under law. This being the position, the trial Court was not justified in allowing the petitions under Section 302 of the Code and the High Court has committed an error in confirming the said order which is liable to be set aside and petitions under Section 302 of the Code are fit to dismissed giving liberty to the heirs either to make application themselves before the Court concerned to continue the prosecution or apply to the Court to grant permission to them to authorize the power of attorney holders to continue the prosecution on their behalf.

(1908), O.3 R.4 - Discharge of advocate - Grant of leave by Court - Leave can be granted upon reasonable conditions being complied with regard to payment of fees of the pleader and papers of client. \n\nThe Rule 8 (5) of the rules in Appendix VI provides that when party seeks to discharge his advocate, he may apply to the Court for the order of discharge following the procedure prescribed and if the Court is satisfied, it may pass orders discharging the advocate and while doing so impose such terms and conditions as it may deem proper. The Court is, therefore, required to be satisfied that the case for discharge is made out. The Court would have to consider the aspects of the fees of the pleader/advocate and the papers of the client. The terms and conditions that the Court may specify would be with regard to either or both of these aspects. A reading of the aforesaid rule also shows that it would be upon the satisfaction of the Court that both the pleader as well as client have been dealt with reasonably, that an order of discharge would be made. It is common knowledge that the pleader cannot, by simplicitor wanting discharge, obtain a discharge. He would have to inform the client, return the papers and then claim discharge. Similarly, therefore, a client cannot simplicitor require a pleader who has worked for him to be discharged to engage another pleader without paying the fees of the pleader. That would tantamount to encouragement of abuse. A pleader and advocate or solicitor is an officer of the Court and must be as much protected as the litigant himself for whom the Courts are established. Consequently the satisfaction of the Court with regard to the protection of both these parties is required.                 [Para 19]"

The professional misconduct committed by the respondent is extremely grave and serious. He has indulged in mischief-making. An advocate found guilty of having filed vakalatnamas without authority and then filing fictitious compromises without any authority deserves punishment commensurate with the degree of misconduct that meets the twin objectives - deterrence and correction. Fraudulent conduct of a lawyer cannot be viewed leniently lest the interest of the administration of justice and the highest traditions of the Bar may become casualty. By showing undue sympathy and leniency in a matter such as this where the advocate has been found guilty of grave and serious professional misconduct, the purity and dignity of the legal profession will be compromised. Any compromise with the purity, dignity and nobility of the legal profession is surely bound to affect the faith and respect of the people in the rule of law. Moreover, the respondentadvocate had been previously found to be involved in a professional misconduct and he was reprimanded.

The Bar is a vital element in the dispensation of justice in our country. A fearless Bar contributes to the objective and independent dispensation of justice. The prohibition contained in Rule 49 is intended to protect against inroads into the professionalism of the Bar. The rule making body is entitled to perceive full time salaried employment as detracting from the role which the Advocates Act, 1961 envisages for Advocates. The prohibition in Rule 49 is based on rational considerations. That being valid, the abrogation of the erstwhile exception cannot be regarded as unreasonable.     [Para 28]\n\nA Lawyer who is engaged by a client is undoubtedly engaged to pursue the case of the client. But the difference between a professional who holds a brief and a full time salaried employee is not merely one of degree. A full time salaried employee is subject to the administrative control of the employer and is answerable to the employer for every aspect of the work rendered in the course of employment. A full time salaried employee receives a prescribed salary, is borne on the establishment of the employer and is subject to the disciplinary jurisdiction of the employer. Within the service, the prospects for career advancement are determined by the employer on the recommendations of a Departmental Promotion Committee. They are subject to the hierarchies of service. Such a position may, therefore, involve the employee in a conflict of duties and interest.     [Para 25]\n\nAs a result of the deletion of the second and third paragraphs of Rule 49 by the Bar Council of India on 22 June 2001, no Advocate would be entitled to be in full time salaried employment of a person, government, firm, corporation or concern. On taking up such employment such a person is under an obligation to inform the State Bar Council and \"shall thereupon cease to practise as an advocate so long as he continues in such employment\". The exception which was available under the second paragraph of Rule 49 stood deleted. Municipal Law Officers in the full time employment of the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai can no longer assert an entitlement to act, appear and plead in any Court.     [Para 22]"

On the matter being called out and inspite of waiting for considerable time, none appeared for the respondents.\n\nHeld that the conduct of the advocates appearing for respondents and of those respondents, was unfair and in violation of law. Under the circumstances, it was expected from the Advocates already engaged to disclose the relation the new counsel sought to be engaged had with the Judge and could have prevented the clients from resorting to such sharp or unfair practice, in part heard matter.  Similarly, the learned counsel ought not to have accepted the part-heard brief and that too which was before her father. Both the learned counsel - the one parting with brief and the other who accepted part heard brief, should have used their best efforts to restrain and prevent their clients from adopting such modus operendi, apparently with mala fide intention with reference to their conduct towards Court. Instead, both the counsel became easy prey to the designs of their clients.  Such conduct is deplorable as it was to influence the decision of a Court or to get adjourn the part-heard matter without any reasonable cause.\n\nNo authority, however high-placed, and relations, acquaintances, can control the decision and influence a judicial or quasi judicial authority.  This is the essence of our judicial system.  By filing such power the parties thought to influence the Judge for relief in their favour or not to proceed with the part heard appeal.  Such action could be said as brow beating tactics. There is no code of conduct as such for the Judges but the Judges who are occupying the pious chair of the Judge, has a self-imposed Code to the effect that a Judge is not hearing the matters in which his blood relations, close friends and other acquaintances are appearing. But, the modus operendi adopted in this case being mala fide and with oblique motive, it was thought in the better interest of justice to deprecate such practice, to hear the counsel of the parties. Besides this courts are called as 'Temples of Justice'. and one who occupies the pious seat of a Judge to impart justice without fear and favour is called (In Marathi script) 'Nyay Devta' and, therefore, the Court expressed readiness to hear the counsel representing the parties including newly engaged counsel. But none appeared. To deprecate and to prevent repetition of such practice either by the advocates representing the parties or the parties the Court proceeded with the case.  [Para 2]"

The advocate keeping the files cannot amount to \"goods bailed\". The word \"bailment\" is defined in Section 148 of the Contract Act as the delivery of goods by one person to another for some purpose, upon a contract that they shall be returned or otherwise disposed of according to the directions of the person delivering them, when the purpose is accomplished. In the case of litigation papers in the hands of the advocate there is neither delivery of goods nor any contract that they shall be returned or otherwise disposed of. That apart, the word \"goods\" mentioned in Section 171 is to be understood in the sense in which that word is defined in the Sale of Goods Act. It must be remembered that Chapter VII of the Contract Act, comprising Sections 76 to 123, had been wholly replaced by the Sale of Goods Act, 1930. The word \"goods\" is defined in Section 2(7) of the Sale of Goods Act as \"every kind of movable property other than actionable claims and money; and includes stock and shares, growing crops, grass, and things attached to or forming part of the land which are agreed to be severed before sale or under the contract of sale.\"\t [Para 8]\n\nThus understood \"goods\" to fall within the purview of Section 171 of the Contract Act should have marketability and the person to whom it is bailed should be in a position to dispose it of in consideration of money. In other words the goods referred to in Section 171 of the Contract Act are saleable goods. There is no scope for converting the case files into money, nor can they be sold to any third party. Hence, the reliance placed on Section 171 of the Contract Act has no merit.\t [Para 9]\n\nWhen the new Bar Council of India came into existence it framed Rules called the Bar Council of India Rules as empowered by the Advocates Act. Such Rules contain provision specifically prohibiting an advocate from adjusting the fees payable to him by a client against his own personal liability to the client. As a rule an Advocate shall not do anything whereby he abuses or takes advantage of the confidence reposed in him by his client, (vide Rule 24). In this context a reference can be made to Rules 28 and 29.\t [Para 12]\n\nThus, even after providing a right for an advocate to deduct the fees out of any money of the client remaining in his hand at the termination of the proceeding for which the advocate was engaged, it is important to notice that no lien is provided on the litigation files kept with him. In the conditions prevailing in India with lots of illiterate people among the litigant public it may not be advisable also to permit the counsel to retain the case bundle for the fees claimed by him. Any such lien if permitted would become susceptible to great abuses and exploitation.\t [Para 13]\n\nNobody would dispute the proposition that the cause in a court / tribunal is far more important for all concerned than the right of the legal practitioner for his remuneration in respect of the services rendered for espousing the cause on behalf of the litigant. If a need arises for the litigant to change his counsel pendente lite, that which is more important should have its even course flowed unimpeded. Retention of records for the unpaid remuneration of the advocate would impede such course and the cause pending judicial disposal would be badly impaired. No professional can be given the right to withhold the returnable records relating to the work done by him with his client's matter on the strength of any claim for unpaid remuneration. The alternative is that the professional concerned can resort to other legal remedies for such unpaid remuneration.\t [Para 14]"

For whatever reason, if a client does not want to continue the engagement of a particular advocate it would be a professional requirement consistent with the dignity of the profession that he should return the brief to the client. It is time to hold that such obligation is not only a legal duty but a moral imperative.\t [Para 15]\n\nIf a party terminates the engagement of an advocate before the culmination of the proceedings that party must have the entire file with him to engage another advocate. But if the advocate who is changed midway adopts the stand that he would not return the file until the fees claimed by him is paid, the situation perhaps may turn to dangerous proportion. There may be cases when a party has no resource to pay the huge amount claimed by the advocate as his remuneration. A party in a litigation may have a version that he has already paid the legitimate fee to the advocate. At any rate if the litigation is pending the party has the right to get the papers from the advocate whom he has changed so that the new counsel can be briefed by him effectively. In either case it is impermissible for the erstwhile counsel to retain the case bundle on the premise that fees is yet to be paid.\t [Para 17]\n\nEven if there is no lien on the litigation papers of his client an advocate is not without remedies to realise the fee which he is legitimately entitled to. But if he has a duty to return the files to his client on being discharged the litigant too has a right to have the files returned to him, more so when the remaining part of the lis has to be fought in the Court. This right of the litigant is to be read as the corresponding counterpart of the professional duty of the advocate.\t\t [Para 18]\n\nMisconduct envisaged in Section 35 of the Advocates Act is not defined. The section uses the expression \"misconduct, professional or otherwise\". The word \"misconduct\" is a relative term. It has to be considered with reference to the subject-matter and the context wherein such term occurs. It literally means wrong conduct or improper conduct. A refusal to return the files to the client when he demanded the same amounted to misconduct under Section 35 of the Act.  [Para 19,23]"

                ],
                "description": "State Bar Council of Madhya Pradesh Rules, Rr.121, 122A - Provisions of R.121 about term of elected Chairman and Vice-chairman and of R.122 about their removal from office by no confidence motion are not ultra vires provisions of S.15 of the Act - Rr.121, 122 also do not suffer from vice of excessive delegation of powers in as much as no guidelines are laid down for their removal.\n\nThe provisions of the Advocates Act are a source of power for the State Bar Council to frame rules and it will not be in consonance with the principles of law to give that power a strict interpretation, unless restricted in scope by specific language. This is particularly so when the provisions delegating such power are of generic nature, such as Section 15(1) of the Act, which requires the Bar Councils to frame rules to 'carry out the purposes of this Chapter' and Section 15(2), which further uses generic terms and expressly states that the Bar Council is empowered to frame rules 'in particular and without prejudice to the generality of the foregoing powers'. If one reads the provisions of clauses (a), (c), (g), (h) and (i) of Sub-section (2) of Section 15 of the Act, then, it is clear that framing of rules thereunder would guide and control the conduct or business of the State Bar Councils and ensure maintenance of the standards of democratic governance in the said Councils. Since the office bearers like the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman are elected by a representative body i.e. by the advocates who are the elected members of the Council, on the basis of the confidence bestowed by the advocates/electorate in the elected members, there seems to be no reason why that very elected body cannot move a 'no confidence motion' against such office bearers, particularly, when the rules so permit. \t\t\t\t\t\t  [Para 40]\n\nThe Bar Council of India, has also framed rules and permitted moving of 'no confidence motion' against its Chairman/Vice-Chairman subject to compliance of the conditions stated therein. Similarly, Rule 122-A of the M.P. Rules contemplates the removal of a Chairman/Vice-Chairman by a motion of no confidence, passed by a specific majority of the members and subject to satisfaction of the conditions stated therein. This provision, thus, can neither be termed as vesting arbitrary powers in the elected body, nor can it be said to be suffering from the vice of excessive delegation. The power delegated to the elected body is within the framework of the principal Act, i.e., Section 15, read with the other provisions, of the Advocates Act. The removal contemplated under Rule 122-A is not founded on a disciplinary action but is merely a 'no confidence motion'. It is only the loss of confidence simpliciter i.e. the majority of the members considering, in their wisdom, that the elected Chairman/Vice-Chairman should not be permitted to continue to hold that office, which is the very basis for such removal. One must remember that Rules 118 to 122-B all come within Chapter XVIII of the M.P. Rules and, as such, have to be examined collectively. But for this Chapter, it cannot be even anticipated as to who and how the office of the Chairman/Vice-Chairman of the State Bar Council shall be appointed. \t\t\t  [Para 41]\n\nIt is also clear that it may not always be absolutely necessary to spell out guidelines for delegated legislation, when discretion is vested in such delegatee bodies. In such cases, the language of the rule framed as well as the purpose sought to be achieved, would be the relevant factors to be considered by the Court. In the present case, the minimum guidelines of secrecy and fairness in election have been provided in Part IX of the Rules, which have been framed in exercise of the supervisory powers under Sections 49(1)(a), 49(1)(i) and 49(1)(j) of the Advocates Act. Further, clause (5) of this Part even extends to the State Bar Councils the power to independently resolve all election disputes through tribunals constituted for this purpose. Therefore, the powers delegated have an in-built element of guidance that the Chairman/Vice-Chairman will be appointed and regulated by the majority members of the State Bar Council. Their conduct, and the conduct of the State Bar Council as a whole, is to be maintained in consonance with democratic principles and keeping the high professional standards of advocates in mind. Thus, it is not a power which falls beyond the purview and scope of Section 15 of the Advocates Act read in conjunction with other provisions, particularly Chapter II and also keeping in view the object of the Act.\t\t\t [Para 44]"

The State Bar Council has no such powers. Thus, the State Bar Council clearly has no legislative competence to frame a Rule which has the effect of disqualifying an advocate from voting at an election of the State Bar Council. Rule 6(h) has the effect of disqualifying an advocate from voting at the election if he fails to pay the subscription, which he is required to pay under rule 40 of Chapter II of Part VI of the rules framed by the Bar Council of India. The Rule, thus, incorporates a condition which has to be satisfied by an advocate before he becomes entitled to vote at an election of the State Bar Council, and therefore, the State Bar Council has no legislative competence to make such a Rule. Rule 6(h), therefore, is clearly beyond the legislative competence of the State Bar Council. Even if such a power is assumed to exist in the State Bar Council, there can be no debate that the power to frame Rules in this regard clearly vests in the Bar Council of India. Even if it is assumed, as is being argued on behalf of the State Bar Council, that such a power concurrently vests also in the State Bar Council then also, as the Bar Council of India in exercise of its power has already framed Rule 2(h) in Part III Chapter I of its Rules, which provides that the name of an advocate appearing in the State roll shall not be included in the electoral roll, if he has not paid the subscription under Rule 40 Chapter II Part VI of the Rules and obtained a receipt from the State Bar Council. The State Bar Council will not have the power to frame either the Rule with this rule or a Rule contrary to that rule, because the powers to frame rule in this regard stands exhausted by one of the two bodies competent to frame such a rule having already exercised that power and framed the rule.

                "description": "Right to practice before courts, tribunals, authorities and persons - Conditions and restrictions - Restrictions contemplated in Art.19(6) of Constitution and Bar Council Rules. \n\nA bare reading of provisions of Ss.29,30,33 clearly shows that the right to practice is a statutory right given to an advocate to practice and an advocate alone is the person who can practice before the courts, tribunals, authorities and persons. But this right is statutorily regulated by two conditions - one, that a person's name should be on the State rolls and second, that he should be permitted by the law for the time being in force, to practice before any authority or person. Where the advocate has a right to appear before an authority or a person, that right can be denied by a law that may be framed by the competent Legislature. Thus, the right to practice is not an absolute right which is free of restriction and is without any limitation. An argument could be raised that a person who has obtained a degree of law is entitled to practice anywhere in India, his right, as enshrined in the Constitution and under the Advocates Act cannot be restricted or regulated and also that it is not necessary for him to enroll himself on any of the State rolls. This argument would be fallacious in face of the provisions of the Advocates Act as well as the restrictions contemplated in Article 19(6) of the Constitution. The Legislature is entitled to make a law relating to the professional or technical qualifications necessary for carrying on that profession.  [Para 15,16]\n\nThe Bar Council of India has been vested with the general power to make rules under Section 49 of the Advocates Act. In furtherance to this power vested with it, the Bar Council of India has framed the Bar Council of India Rules. Chapter III of these Rules deals with the conditions for the right to practice. These Rules also demonstrate the intention of the Legislature to place restrictions for entry to the profession of law. These restrictions have to be decided only on the touchstone of reasonableness and legislative competency. The restriction which withstands such a test would be enforceable in accordance with law.

Court held that expression \"fly in and fly out\" will only cover a casual visit not amounting to \"practice\". In case of a dispute whether a foreign lawyer was limiting himself to \"fly in and fly out\" on casual basis for the purpose of giving legal advice to their clients in India regarding foreign law or their own system of law and on diverse international legal issues or whether in substance he was doing practice which is prohibited can be determined by the Bar Council of India.

If the Rules of Institutional Arbitration apply or the matter is covered by the provisions of the Arbitration Act, foreign lawyers may not be debarred from conducting arbitration proceedings arising out of international commercial arbitration in view of Sections 32 and 33 of the Advocates Act. However, they will be governed by code of conduct applicable to the legal profession in India.

[Para 9]\n\nThe words 'the date of that order', therefore, mean and must be construed as meaning the date of communication or knowledge, actual or constructive, of the order sought to be reviewed.   [Para 14]\n\nReading word for word and assigning a literal meaning to Section 48AA would lead to absurdity, futility and to such consequences as the Parliament could have never intended. The provision has an ambiguity and is capable of being read in more ways than one. We must, therefore, assign the provision a meaning-and so read it-as would give life to an otherwise lifeless letter and enable the power of review conferred thereby being meaningfully availed and effectively exercised.   [Para 18]\n\nThe jurisdiction to exercise power of review does not come to an end merely by lapse of sixty days from the date of the order sought to be reviewed. In view of the construction which we have placed hereinabove, the expression 'sixty days from' the date of that order' prescribes the period of limitation for invoking the power of review. It has nothing to do with the actual exercise of power by the Bar Council. In other words, merely by lapse of sixty days from the date of the order sought to be reviewed, the Bar Council of India  or any of its Committees is not divested of its power to exercise review jurisdiction. That is the only reasonable construction which can be placed on the provision as framed, though we cannot resist observing that the provision is not happily drafted.   [Para 19]"

The very purpose of disciplinary control by Bar Council cannot be permitted to be frustrated.

But at the same time, the High Court and even this Court cannot take upon itself the disciplinary control as envisaged under the Advocates Act. No doubt about it that the Court has the duty to maintain its decorum within the Court premises, but that can be achieved by taking appropriate steps under Contempt of Courts Act in accordance with law as permitted under the decisions of this Court and even by rule making power under Section 34 of the Advocates Act.

                "description": "Advocates - Cannot go on strike or give call of boycott - Adjournment cannot be granted on ground that lawyers are on strike - It is only in rarest of rare case court may turn a blind eye to a protest absentation from work for not more than one day.\n\nS. N. Variava, J (for himself and on behalf of  G. B. Pattanaik, C.J. and Doraiswamy, J.:-  It is the duty of every Advocate who has accepted a brief to attend trial, even though it may go on day to day for a prolonged period. It is also settled law that a lawyer who has accepted a brief cannot refuse to attend Court because a boycott call is given by the Bar Association. It is settled law that it is unprofessional as well as unbecoming for a lawyer who has accepted a brief to refuse to attend Court even in pursuance of a call for strike or boycott by the Bar Association or the Bar Council. It is settled law that Courts are under an obligation to hear and decide cases brought before it and cannot adjourn matters merely because lawyers are on strike. The law is that it is the duty and obligation of Courts to go on with matters or otherwise it would tantamount to becoming a privy to the strike. It is also settled law that if a resolution is passed by Bar Associations expressing want of confidence in judicial officers it would amount to scandalising the Courts to undermine its authority and thereby the Advocates will have committed contempt of Court it must also be remembered that an Advocate is an officer of the Court and enjoys special status in society. Advocates have obligations and duties to ensure smooth functioning of the Court. They owe a duty to their client. Strikes interfere with administration of justice. They cannot thus disrupt Court proceedings and put interest of their clients in jeopardy.\t [Para 30,31]\n\nIn conclusion it is held that lawyers have no right to go on strike or give a call for boycott, not even on a token strike. The protest, if any is required, can only be by giving press statements. TV interviews carrying out of Court premises banners and/or placards, wearing black or white or any colour arm bands, peaceful protect marches outside and away from Court premises, going on dharnas or relay facts etc. It is held that lawyers holding Vakalats on behalf of their clients cannot not attend Courts in pursuance to a call for strike or boycott. All lawyers must bodily refuse to abide by any call for strike or boycott. No lawyer can be visited with any adverse consequences by the Association or the Council and no threat or coercion of any nature including that of expulsion can be held out. It is held that no Bar Council or Bar Association can permit calling of a meeting for purposes of considering a call for strike or boycott and requisition, if any, for such meeting must be ignored. It is held that only in the rarest of rare cases where the dignity, integrity and independence of the Bar and/or the Bench are at stake. Courts may ignore (turn a blind eye) to a protest abstention from work for not more than one day. It is being clarified that it will be for the Court to decide whether or not the issue involves dignity or integrity or independence of the Bar and/or the Bench. Therefore in such cases the President of the Bar must first consult the Chief Justice or the District Judge before Advocate decide to absent themselves from Court. The decision of the Chief Justice or the District Judge would be final and have to be abided by the Bar. It is held that Courts are under no obligation to adjourn matters because lawyers are on strike. On the contrary, it is the duty of all Courts to go on with matters on their boards even in the absence of lawyers. In other words. Courts must not be privy to strikes or calls for boycotts. It is held that if a lawyer, holding Vakalats of a client, abstains from attending Court due to a strike call. he shall be personally liable to pay costs which shall be addition to damages which he might have to pay his client for loss suffered by him.\t [Para 45]\n\nPer Shah, J. (for himself and on behalf of D.M. Dharmadhikari, J. & Concurring):-\t Vot present at present it is admitted that judiciary is over-burdened with pending litigation. If strikes are resorted to on one or the other ground, litigants would suffer as cases would not be decided for years to come. Therefore, some concrete joint action is required to be taken by the Bench and the Bar to see that for this purpose, the suggestion made by the Bar Council of India in its resolution dated 29th September, 2002, requires to be seriously considered and implemented by each Bar Association. Grievances Redressal Committees at Taluka level, district level. High Court level and Supreme Court level should be established so that grievances of the advocates at all levels could be resolved. If action is required to be taken on the grievances made by the advocates it should be immediately taken. If grievances are found not to be genuine then it should be made clear so that there may not be any further . It is true that advocates are part and parcel of judicial system as such they are the foundation of Justice- Delivery System. It is their responsibility of seeing that justice delivery system works smoothly. Therefore, it is for each and every Bar association to be vigilant in implementing the resolution passed by the bar Council of India of seeing that there are no further strike any more. The Bar Council of India in its resolution has also stated that the resolution passed by it would be implemented strictly and thence,the Bar associations and the individual members of the Bar associations would take all steps to comply with the same and avoid cessation of the work except in the manner and to the extent indicated in the resolution.\t [Para 6,7,8]\n\nFurther appropriate rules are required to be framed by the High Courts under Section 34 of the Advocates Act by making it clear that strike by advocate/advocates would be considered interference with administration of justice and concerned advocate/advocates may be barred from practising before Courts in a district or in the High Court.\t [Para 9]"

Is the genus of which the right to appear and conduct cases in the Court may be a specie. But the right to appear and conduct cases in the Court is a matter on which the Court must and does have major supervisory and controlling power. Hence Courts cannot be and are not divested of control of supervision of conduct in Court merely because it may involve the right of an advocate. A rule can stipulate that a person who has committed contempt of Court or has behaved unprofessionally and in an unbecoming manner will not have the right to continue to appear and plead and conduct cases in Courts. The Bar Councils cannot overrule such a regulation concerning the orderly conduct of Court proceedings. On the contrary it will be their duty to see that such a rule is strictly abided by. Courts of law are structured in such a design as to evoke respect and reverence to the majesty of law and justice. The machinery for dispensation of justice according to law is operated by the Court. Proceedings inside the Courts are always expected to be held in a dignified and orderly manner. The very sight of an advocate, who is guilty of Contempt of Court or of unbecoming or unprofessional conduct, standing in the Court would erode the dignity of the Court and even corrode the majesty of it besides impairing the confidence of the public in the efficacy of the institution of the Courts. The power to frame such rules should not be confused with the right to practise law.\t [Para 44]"

Because of such strikes, the ultimate sufferers are the litigants. From the data mentioned in the impugned judgment and order, things are very shocking. Every month on 3-4 Saturdays, the Advocates are on strike and abstain from working, on one pretext or the other. If the lawyers would have worked on those days, it would have been in the larger interest and it would have achieved the ultimate goal of speedy justice, which is now recognized as a fundamental right under Arts. 14 and 21 of the Constitution. It would have helped in early disposal of the criminal trials and therefore it would have been in the interest of those who are languishing in the jail and waiting for their trial to conclude. When the Institution is facing a serious problem of arrears and delay in disposal of cases, how the Institution as a whole can afford such four days strike in a month. The submission on behalf of the petitioner that to go on strike/boycott courts is a fundamental right of Freedom of Speech and Expression under Art. 19(1)(a) of the Constitution and it is a mode of peaceful representation to express the grievances by the lawyers\u2019 community is concerned, such a right to freedom of speech cannot be exercised at the cost of the litigants and/or at the cost of the Justice Delivery System as a whole. To go on strike/boycott courts cannot be justified under the guise of the right to freedom of speech and expression under Art. 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. Nobody has the right to go on strike/boycott courts. Even, such a right, if any, cannot affect the  rights of others and more particularly, the right of Speedy Justice guaranteed under Arts. 14 and 21 of the Constitution. Therefore, boycotting courts on every Saturday in the entire District of Dehradun, in several districts of Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar district in the State of Uttarakhand is not justifiable at all and as such it tantamounts to contempt of the courts. Directions issued by the High Court to District Bar Associations of Dehradun, Haridwar and Udham Singh Nagar to withdraw their call for strike and start attending courts on all working Saturdays, proper.

                "description": "Constitution of India, Arts.14, 18 - Constitutional validity of Section 16 - Designation of Senior Advocate - Power of designation vested in Supreme Court and High Courts, not an uncontrolled, unguided, uncanalised power - Though improper exercise of such power may result into certain adverse consequences, same cannot be a ground to invalidate S.16 - Classification of Advocate and Senior Advocate is based on reasonable parameters - Further, no violation of Art.18 of Constitution as designation u/S.16 is not a conferment of title - It is only a distinction - Test of constitutionality passed by Section 16.\n\n\tThe exercise of the power vested in the Supreme Court and the High Courts to designate an Advocate as a Senior Advocate is circumscribed by the requirement of due satisfaction that the concerned advocate fulfills the three conditions stipulated under Section 16 of the Advocates Act, 1961, i.e., (1) ability; (2) standing at the bar; and/or (3) special knowledge or experience in law that the person seeking designation has acquired. It is not an uncontrolled, unguided, uncanalised power though in a given case its exercise may partake such a character. However, the possibility of misuse cannot be a ground for holding a provision of the Statute to be constitutionally fragile. The consequences spelt out by the intervener, namely, (1) indulgence perceived to be shown by the Courts to Senior Advocates; (2) the effect of designation on the litigant public on account of high fees charged; (3) its baneful effect on the junior members of the bar; and (4) the element of anti-competitiveness, etc. are untoward consequences occasioned by human failures. Possible consequences arising from a wrong/improper exercise of power cannot be a ground to invalidate the provisions of Section 16 of the Act. Recognition of qualities of merit and ability demonstrated by in-depth knowledge of intricate questions of law; fairness in court proceedings consistent with the duties of a counsel as an officer of the Court and contributions in assisting the Court to charter the right course of action in any given case, all of which would go to determine the standing of the Advocate at the bar is the object behind the classification. Such an object would enhance the value of the legal system that Advocates represent. So long as the basis of the classification is founded on reasonable parameters which can be introduced by way of uniform guidelines/norms to be laid down by Supreme Court, the power of designation conferred by Section 16 of the Act cannot be said to be constitutionally impermissible.\n\n\tSimilar is the position with regard to the challenge founded on the alleged violation of Article 18 of the Constitution of India. The designation 'Senior Advocate' is hardly a title. It is a distinction; a recognition. Use of the said designation (i.e. Senior Advocate), per se, would not be legally impermissible inasmuch as in other vocations also we find use of similar expressions as in the case of a doctor referred to as a 'Consultant' which has its own implications in the medical world. There are doctors who are referred to as 'Senior Consultants' or as a 'Senior Surgeon'. Such expressions are instances of recognition of the talent and special qualities of a person which has been proved and tested over a period of time. In fact, even in bureaucratic circles such suffixes and prefixes are also not uncommon. We, therefore, take the view that the designation of 'Advocates' as 'Senior Advocates' as provided for in Section 16 of the Act would pass the test of constitutionality and the endeavour should be to lay down norms/guidelines/parameters to make the exercise conform to the three requirements of the Statute namely, (1) ability of the advocate concerned; (2) his/her standing at the bar; and (3) his/her special knowledge or experience in law. \t [Para 23,24]"

There is a further command to BCI to dispose it off as if it were a proceeding withdrawn for enquiry under sub-section (2) of Section 36. Thus, the jurisdiction for conducting the enquiry and disposal of the complaint is conferred on the BCI by the mandate of the Act. The context, the intention and the purpose is clear as crystal. The BCI is required to exercise original jurisdiction that was to be exercised by the State Bar Council.\n\n\tWhen the language employed under Section 36B(1) and Section 36 are read in juxtaposition, there remains no scintilla of doubt that the legislature desired that the disciplinary proceedings are to be put an end to within a particular time frame by the State Bar Council and if that is not done, the whole thing gets transferred to the BCI, which is obliged to cause an enquiry. Thus understood, there can be no trace of doubt that the original jurisdiction to deal with the complaint stands transferred to the BCI. Once the original jurisdiction is transferred, to rely upon the language that the BCI may dispose of would include any manner of disposal which would include a remand, cannot be thought of.

The rules have been framed in exercise of the power conferred under Section 34 of the Advocates Act. Section 34 of the Act does not confer such a power to frame rules to debar lawyer for professional misconduct. The amendment made by providing Rule 14(A)(vii) to (xii) is not authorized under the Advocate Act. The High Court has no power to exercise the disciplinary control. It would amount to usurpation of the power of Bar Council conferred under Advocates Act. However, the High Court may punish advocate for contempt and then debar him from practicing for such specified period as may be permissible in accordance with law, but without exercising contempt jurisdiction by way of disciplinary control no punishment can be imposed. As such impugned rules could not have been framed within the purview of Section 34. Provisions clearly impinge upon the independence of the Bar and encroach upon the exclusive power conferred upon the Bar Council of the State and the Bar Council of India under the Advocates Act. The amendment made to the Rules 14(A) to 14(D) have to be held to be ultra vires of the power of the High Court.

Section 34 does not confer such power of debarment by way of disciplinary methods or disciplinary inquiry as against an advocate as that has to be dealt with by the Bar Council as provided in other sections in a different chapter of the Act. It is only when the advocate is found guilty of contempt of court, as provided in Rule 14 as existed in the Madras High Court Rules, 1970 takes care of situation until and unless an advocate who has committed contempt of court purges himself of contempt shall not be entitled to appear or act or plead in the Court. The debarment cannot be ordered by the High Court until and unless advocate is prosecuted under the Contempt of Courts Act. It cannot be resorted to by undertaking disciplinary proceedings as contemplated under the Rules 14-A to 14-D as amended in 2016. That is a clear usurpation of the power of the Bar Council and is wholly impermissible. (1998) 4 SCC 409 Foll. \t [Para 69,70,77,78]"

LL.B. course and senior secondary certificate for Integrated Degree Program (5 yrs.) - Had the Rules intended otherwise Rules would have specifically provided so - Petitioner had obtained Senior Secondary Certificate by attending regular school - When a regular certificate is granted by a recognised board, there is presumption that candidate was eligible to be conferred the certificate - Hence, denial to give admission on said ground not proper - As petitioner was a candidate for session 2016-17 direction issued to accommodate petitioner in ensuing session of law course.\n\n\t There is a difference between open universities and other universities and/or boards, in that some of these open universities enable candidates, who do not have the basic qualifications, to obtain higher qualifications straightaway. By prosecuting studies through open universities, it may be possible for a candidate to obtain a Post Graduate Degree or a Three Year LLB Degree without being a graduate or to obtain a graduate degree without having the Senior Secondary School Certificate. The Bar Council of India, in its wisdom, framed the Legal Education Rules making a graduate degree upon prosecution of a regular course from a university, whose degree in Law is recognized by Bar Council of India, in a mandatory eligibility criteria.\n\n\tHad it been the intention of the Bar Council that for admission to Three Year LLB Course a candidate would be required to obtain all the previous requisite degrees and certificates, such as the Secondary School Certificate and Senior Secondary School Certificate, by prosecuting a regular course, the Legal Education Rules would have specifically provided so.\n\n\tThe language and tenor of Rules 5(a) and 5(b) read with the first proviso and the Explanation make it amply clear that prosecution of a regular course is mandatory only for the immediately previous qualifying certificate and/or degree, for example, graduate degree for the Three Year LLB Course and Senior Secondary Certificate for the Integrated Degree Program. Had the Rules intended otherwise, the Rules would have specifically provided that candidates would not be eligible for admission to the Three Year LLB unless they had obtained the Secondary and Senior Secondary Certificates upon prosecution of studies through a regular course or through distance or correspondence mode. The Bar Council of India has, in its wisdom, chosen to frame rules whereunder prosecution of a regular course is mandatory only in respect of the Senor Secondary Certificate for admission to the Integrated Degree Course and in respect of graduation for admission to the Three Year LLB course.\n\n\tOnce a recognized university or a recognized board issues a certificate, it is not for any other authority to question the certificate on the ground of ineligibility to obtain the certificate, until and unless the certificate is cancelled by an appropriate authority and/or by a Court of law. To hold otherwise would be to open the pandora's box, for years later certificates might be questioned on grounds such as inadequate attendance, failure to clear internal test examinations and the like and it would be impossible for candidates possessing the degree and/or certificate to adduce cogent materials and/or evidence to satisfy those questioning the certificates. When a regular certificate is granted by a recognized board, there is a presumption that the candidate was eligible to be conferred the certificate.\n\n\tThe petitioner was a candidate for admission in the session commencing from 2016-17. Since the petitioner has wrongfully been denied admission, he shall be accommodated in the ensuing session of Three Year Law Course.\n\n2016-2-L.W. 64 (Mad) DB Overruled.  [Para 41,42,43,44,45]"

That is why the statutory Board has been given the authority to grant sanction.  The Board is expected to consider the materials placed before it and take a decision as to who are to be prosecuted.  It is not an empty formality.  The Board has a statutory duty to consider the material placed before it by the investigating agency and then decide whether prosecution is necessary and if so who are all to be prosecuted.  It cannot be left to the whims and fancy of the Investigation Officer or Inspector or Air Pollution Officer to file complaint against anybody he chooses from the directors and officers of the company.  It is the Board alone which has to take a decision as to who amongst the directors of the company and who amongst the officers of the Company are responsible for the alleged violation under the Act.  In this case Board has sanctioned prosecution only against the Company.  Hence, the prosecution of the directors and the factory manager cannot be sustained without proper sanction under the Act 1980 Crl. L.J.NOC 93 (Raj) and 1986 Cr.L.J. 1811 Relied on.  [Para 8,9]"

Thus, octroi would not be leviable on the entry of such aircrafts into the municipal limits if such entry is for the purpose of flying in and out of the municipal limits for passenger transport. In order to attract octroi, it is essential that the article should have been imported for sale, use or consumption within the municipal limits. If the article is imported within the city limits not for use therein but temporarily as in transit, it must be necessarily inferred that the article has not entered for use within the municipal limits. It is settled law that octroi is not leviable if goods are not brought into the octroi area for the purpose of use in the area but for export and, in fact, exported by the importer. It is clear that no octroi can be charged whether for use or consumption within the local limits unless the goods come to a repose there. Further an article cannot be said to have been imported for use unless it is meant to be used for an indefinite period within the municipal limits so that it ultimately rest within the municipal limits and does not come out subsequently.   [Para 26,28]\n\nAssuming that there is some kind of use involved in disembarkation, embarkation of passengers, luggages and fueling, such use is not use within the meaning of that term in Section 192 in relation to an aircraft.

A distinction is sought to be drawn between \"airport service\" and a \"scheduled airport service\". Here also, it may be mentioned that Rule 11 clearly lays down that every pilot employed on a scheduled air transported service cannot use any place as a regular place of landing and departure purpose by helicopters owned by respondent No. 7. The pilots are engaged by Tatas. The officers are carried from Juhu Airport to the site in question and in the circumstances, Rule 11 is applicable.

In the instant case, it is an undisputed fact that the license has been granted under Section 146 (ii) of Regulation, 1966 under Form AG3. The said prescribed Form does not stipulate the period of licensing right. In the absence of stipulation of period, the contention urged on behalf of Respondent No.1 that it is a perpetual license in respect of the acquired land is a tenable contention, particularly having regard to the classes of tenants defined under Section 141 of the Regulation, 1966 extracted supra. Respondent No.1 has acquired interest in the land in dispute, in terms of the notifications under Sections 4(1), 4(2) read with Section 17(1) of the L.A. Act, wherein the parts and parcels of land along with building structures, the trees and crops have been clearly mentioned. Such an interest could only be extinguished in terms of Section 162 of the Regulation, 1966. That is to say that the right of Respondent No.1 could be extinguished only in terms of a notification to acquire the land. That was done by the Lieutenant Governor of Andaman and Nicobar Islands, who issued notifications to acquire the land, building structures including the standing trees and crops. The Award has been passed on a part of this land. The Award on the remaining 6 hectares of land was not passed by the Land Acquisition Collector, even though the entire land including the building structures, the trees and crops had been acquired for the aforesaid purpose of establishing industry. Not awarding compensation as provided under Section 11 of the L.A. Act amounts to deliberate omission in discharge of statutory duty by the Collector, despite the statutory right vesting in Respondent No.1 for award of compensation in lieu of losing the holding rights over the land on account of acquisition of the same by the Government. Therefore, Respondent No.1 rightly approached the High Court praying that the Writ of Mandamus be issued to the Review Petitioners-Appellants to pass an Award of compensation in its favour in respect of the remaining land.\n\n2013 ALL SCR 799, 2004(5) ALL MR 79 (S.C.), AIR 1965 Mysore 222, AIR 1968 SC 1045 Disting. \t\t [Para 11]"

Taken to its absurd length such a member could after superannuation claim that, as the services were not terminated, he was entitled to pension and gratuity on the basis that he had continued in service.  The requirement of communication of acceptance would only arise in cases where, even after giving of a notice of voluntary retirement the member continues to work/perform his duties.  In such cases the member would need to know from what date he can stop attending office.  In cases where the member has by his own conduct abandoned service the severance of the relationship of master and servant takes place immediately on acceptance of notice.

Constitution of India, Art.226.\n\nIn the present case, the Government's decision to grant extension or to relax the applicability of Rule 16(1) in favour of respondent Nos.6 and 7 thus cannot be termed as one without authority of law. Of course, exercise of such power has to be for valid reasons in public interest and the proposal should satisfy the ingredients of the specified Rules.\n\nWhatever be the grounds, the approval of the Central Government has to be supported by some proper reasons and essentially has to be in the public interest. Reasons are the essence of any administrative or executive decision. Reasons may be, unlike judgments elaborate, but they must provide some grounds akin to good and valid reasons in support of the decision. Every decision making process is open to judicial review and the Courts normally would not substitute their view for the decision taken by the authorities. The reasoning given by the initiating authority in the Ministry of the Central Government was examined by us. However, in the absence of any reasons for exercise of power of relaxation by the concerned authority, the Courts would not be in a position to express any opinion as to whether such exercise of power is in public interest or not. Wherever the statutory provisions or the Rules confer wide power on an authority, greater is the obligation upon the authorities to act fairly and in adherence to the spirit of Article 14 of the Constitution of India.\n\nThe public interest is a term of wide magnitude and covers within its ambit efficiency, exigencies of service and interest of the public at large. These are some of the relevant considerations which the executive authorities are required to take into consideration before arriving at a final decision. Absence of any reasons or valid reasons would be a ground which would attract the scrutiny by Courts.\n\nIn the present case, no reasons appear to have been recorded by the concerned authorities while not adhering to the unfavourable note put up for their consideration. The records do not reflect that any reasons were provided or even considered by the Governments as to why the respondent No.7 be not given re-employment and that the case of respondent No.6 was not at all covered under Rule 16(1) though referred to in the letter issued by the State Government. Absence of such reasoning or rationality gives rise to the element to arbitrariness. The relevant considerations as emerged from the rules were not considered while irrelevant or extraneous considerations were taken into account during the decision making process. It needs to be noticed that all the officers who have reached such highest posts in the hierarchy of Indian Police Services are expected to have 'very good' or 'outstanding' service record and profile with distinguishing achievements to their career. Grant of extension at such high position which only carries one post, does have the effect on other members of the force. The obvious effect is that, grant of extension to one denies right of consideration to number of other senior officers who may be eligible to hold that post. It certainly hurts their legal expectancy to hold the post of Director General of Police/ Police Commissioner, Mumbai. The respondents are expected to take into consideration the consequences of their decision on interest of service and individual interest surely maintaining the public interest being of paramount relevancy.

What is necessary to be seen while applying rule 16(3) of the said Rules is whether the employee has put in a sufficient number of years of service, at the age of 50, having qualified for full pension. If the employee is retired on full pensionary benefits, it cannot be said that he suffers any real prejudice. The basis on which this view has proceeded is that for efficient administration it is necessary that public servant should enjoy a sense of security of tenure. It is thus clear that, irrespective of normal age of retirement, under rule 16(3) the government is competent to retire compulsorily a government servant prematurely if it is thought that such premature retirement is necessary in public interest. This power can be exercised in cases where the government servant after sufficient number of years of service is qualified for full pension at 50 years of age. In other words, the premature retirement can be forced on the government servant if he has either completed 30 years of service or has attained 50 years of age. Taking into consideration, minimum age and maximum age for recruitment for IAS cadre, which is 21 years and 28 years respectively, we have no hesitation in holding that prescribing 50 years of age for compulsory retirement for All India Service Officers is sufficiently long period. Moreover, an order of compulsory retirement implies no stigma nor any suggestion of misbehaviour. It cannot be said to be removal from service nor punishment so as to attract the provisions of Article 311(2) of the Constitution. In the instant case, the petitioner has completed sufficient number of years of service and has been retired on full pensionary benefits and has not suffered any real prejudice. In the result, the submission that rule 16(3) is arbitrary and invalid must be rejected.  AIR 1970 SC 143 and AIR 1964 SC 600 - Followed.  [Para 8]"

(1908), S.2(11) - Claim for compensation by non-dependent legal representative - Maintainability - As per S.166(1) legal representative can file application for compensation - The term legal representative does not mean dependent only - Therefore, merely because one is not dependant, that by itself, is no ground for not entertaining any claim for compensation under MV Act.\n\n In view of the plain language under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, which is a substantive provision for making application for compensation, it is clear that either the injured person or the legal representative of the deceased are entitled to make an application for award of compensation. Dependency is a matter, which will have a bearing on the issue with regard to fixation of compensation and apportionment of compensation if there are more than one claimant, but at the same time, in view of the plain and unambiguous language used under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, the term legal representative does not mean dependant only. It is fairly well settled that the legal representative is one who can represent the estate of the deceased.Further, in the judgment in Manjuri Beras case (supra), the Honble Supreme Court has held that the no fault liability envisaged under Section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act is distinguishable from the rule of strict liability. In the aforesaid judgment, it is further held that right to make an application has to be considered in the background of right to entitlement. It is further held that while assessing the quantum of compensation, the multiplier system is applied because of deprivation of dependency. In the same judgment, it is also held that since the amount to be awarded under Section 140 of the Motor Vehicles Act is a fixed/crystalised amount, the same is to be considered as a part of the estate of the deceased. Apart from the same, there can be a claim for compensation under other conventional heads which are to be necessarily incurred in the case of deaths. 2007 ALL SCR 1617, 1991 ACJ 707, 2014 ALL SCR 1104 Ref. to. \t [Para 14,15]"

                "description": "Aircraft Rules (1937), R.3(26) - Aeronautics Act (1985) (Canada), S.3(1) - Insurance claim - Repudiation - Claim pertaining to aviation accident/glider accident - Causing death of son of claimant - Deceased was travelling in motorized glider for sight seeing which was duly licensed standard type of aircraft - It brings him out of exclusion in clause under insurance policy - He was travelling as fair paying passenger in flight of an air charter company - Bringing him out of scope of exclusion in policy clause - Therefore, accident out of which claim arose was completely covered under ambit of policy - Repudiation of claim by insurance company, not proper.\n\nIn the instant case though the \u201cglider\u201d in question belonging to soaring centre which met with accident death of deceased was equipped with an engine, this was mainly for the purpose of adding selflaunching capacity to the vehicle, as evident from the Transport safety Board of Cananda,TSBC Report. Be that as it may, the fact that the glider was motorised would not imply that it was not an aircraft at all. Even the TSBC Report unequivocally refers to the glider as an \u201caircraft\u201d repeatedly. Importantly, the terms \u201caircraft\u201d and \u201cglider\u201d have not been defined within the Policy. In such circumstances, the glider in question must be regarded as an aircraft under the Policy. (Para 8)\n\nNo rigid distinction can be culled out between \u201cstandard\u201d and \u201cnonstandard\u201d aircraft. The usage of as vague a phrase as \u201cstandard type of aircraft\u201d in the Policy, thus, suggests that the same must be construed in a liberal manner so as to benefit the insured had the insurer really intended to exclude gliding activity from the purview of the Policy, it could have done so expressly, similar to the manner in which hanggliding and paragliding were excluded in Clause 7(xiii) of the Policy. Similarly, the insurer could have also defined the phrase \u201cstandard type of aircraft\u201d for the purpose of the Policy, but it chose not to do so. In these circumstances, it is not open to the insurer to reject a claim arising out of a glider accident by now arguing that a glider is not a standard aircraft by virtue of not principally being a powered aircraft. Therefore regardless of whether the glider involved in the accident was powered or nonpowered, motorised or nonmotorised, it was a \u201cstandard type of aircraft\u201d envisioned in the Policy. (Para 9)\n\nFurther there was no evidence of a licence being required in respect of each aircraft/ glider, and the private registration undertaken with respect to the glider in question, in addition to the municipal business licence, was sufficient compliance with the requirement of the aircraft being duly licensed moreover here was specific finding in the TSBC Report that the glider was certified, equipped and maintained in accordance with existing regulations and approved procedures, and compliant with rules such as the Visual Flight Rules. The Report further observes that even the pilot of the glider was certified and qualified for the flight as per existing regulations, indicating that such separate glider pilot licence was in accordance with the legal requirements. Thus, we conclude that it was rightly held that the aircraft in question was duly licensed. (Para 10)\n\nThe Pemberton Soaring Centre giving out air craft on hire for aerial jourcy was an air charter company within the meaning of clause of the Insurance Policy. (Para 11)\n\nFurther it cannot be said that the deceased was not a passenger merely because the journey was supposed to begin and terminate at the same location + Needless to say, the purpose of the journey was to fly over various scenic spots, and after completion, the glider was to return to a designated location, presumably from where it took off. this would not be dissimilar to how a sightseeing bus might originate and terminate its journey at the same spot after passing by various places of interest. We find it difficult to conclude that a person undertaking such a journey would not amount to a \u201cpassenger\u201d. Further, it was evident from the record that the journey on the glider was undertaken for a fixed consideration, though the ticket for the same has not been placed on record. Thus, it can be said that the deceased was a farepaying passenger on the glider in question. (Para 12)\n\nTherefore, the accident of glider causing death of deceased out of which the instant claim arose was completely covered under the ambit of the Policy, since the deceased was travelling in a duly licensed standard type of aircraft, which brings him out of the exclusion in Clause under policy, and was travelling as a farepaying passenger in a flight of an air charter company, bringing him out of the scope of the exclusion in Clause. Thus in facts, repudiation of claim by insuance company was not proper. (Para 13)"

In this connection, Rule 11 clearly lays down that no pilot carrying passengers for hire or reward shall use any place for a series of landings and departures without permission/approval in accordance with the provisions of the Air Craft Rules.  A distinction is sought to be drawn between \"airport service\" and a \"scheduled airport service\". Here also, it may be mentioned that Rule 11 clearly lays down that every pilot employed on a scheduled air transported service cannot use any place as a regular place of landing and departure purpose by helicopters owned by respondent No. 7. The pilots are engaged by Tatas. The officers are carried from Juhu Airport to the site in question and in the circumstances, Rule 11 is applicable. The plot is used for a series of landings and departures.\n\nTaking into account the facts of the present case and particularly in view of the fact that the landing site is being used on regular basis twice in a week, we are of the view that respondent No.7 is required to obtain the requisite licence from the competent authority under the Air Craft Rules before making use of the above plot 148 as a helipad.

Given their ordinary meaning there is no gainsaying that an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court only in accordance with the provisions of Section 31. A conjoint reading of Sections 30 and 31 can lead to only one conclusion viz. there is no vested right of appeal against a final order or decision of the Tribunal to the Supreme Court other than those falling under Section 30(2) of the Act. A careful reading of S.31(2) shows that it not only stipulates the period for making an application to the Tribunal for grant of leave to appeal to Supreme Court but also stipulates the period for making an application to Supreme Court for leave to file an appeal against the said order sought to be challenged. It is significant that the period stipulated for filing application to the Supreme Court starts running from the date beginning from the date the application made to the Tribunal for grant of certificate is refused by the Tribunal. This implies that the aggrieved party cannot approach Supreme Court directly for grant of leave to file an appeal under Section 31(1) read with Section 31(2) of the Act. The scheme of Section 31 being that an application for grant of a certificate must first be moved before the Tribunal, before the aggrieved party can approach this Court for the grant of leave to file an appeal. The purpose underlying the provision appears to be that if the Tribunal itself grants a certificate of fitness for filing an appeal, it would be unnecessary for the aggrieved party to approach Supreme Court for a leave to file such an appeal. An appeal by certificate would then be maintainable as a matter of right in view of Section 30 which uses the expression \"an appeal shall lie to the Supreme Court\". That appears to us to be the true legal position on a plain reading of the provisions of Sections 30 and 31. Further an application for leave to appeal is deemed to have been disposed of at the expiration of the time within which it may have been made but is not made within that time. That apart an application for grant of certificate before the Tribunal can be made even orally and in case the Tribunal is not inclined to grant the certificate prayed for, the request can be rejected straightaway in which event the aggrieved party can approach Supreme Court for grant of leave to file an appeal under the second part of Section 31(1). Once such an application is filed, the appeal is treated as pending till such time the same is disposed of.  [Para 3,6,7,17]"

NAGAPPAN, J. :-\n\nNo time limit is prescribed in the Regulation for the exercise of suo motu power but the question is as to whether the suo motu power could be exercised after a period of 50 years. The Division Bench of the High Court was right in affirming the view of the learned single Judge of the High Court that the suo motu revision undertaken after a long lapse of time, even in the absence of any period of limitation was arbitrary and opposed to the concept of rule of law.  [Para 11,12]\n\n Per T.S. THAKUR J. :-\n\nThe delayed exercise of revisional jurisdiction is frowned upon because if actions or transactions were to remain forever open to challenge, it will mean avoidable and endless uncertainty in human affairs, which is not the policy of law. Because, even when there is no period of limitation prescribed for exercise of such powers, the intervening delay, may have led to creation of third party rights, that cannot be trampled by a belated exercise of a discretionary power especially when no cogent explanation for the delay is in sight. Rule of law it is said must run closely with the rule of life. Even in cases where the orders sought to be revised are fraudulent, the exercise of power must be within a reasonable period of the discovery of fraud. Simply describing an act or transaction to be fraudulent will not extend time for its correction to infinity; for otherwise the exercise of revisional power would itself be tantamount to a fraud upon the statute that vests such power in an authority.

Near the area meaning near the protected monument. Any other interpretation of the provisions of Rule 31 may not be permissible. If we look at the wording of Sub-Rule 2 of Rule 31 it requires that every said notice of intention shall specify the limits of the area which is to be so declared and shall invite objections. It specifically contemplates specifications of limits of the area which is to be declared as prohibitory or regulatory area. By very nature of these rules therefore it cannot be one specification for all kinds of protected monuments. The area or the limit of area to be notified under Rule 31 must vary from protected monument to protected monument. To illustrate the prohibitory or regulated area around Shaniwarwada in Pune and that around Ajanta Caves in Ajanta cannot be the same. No purpose will be served around Ajanta caves if mining operations are to be prohibited only around area of 300 meters from Ajanta Caves. The entire hill on which caves are existing will have to be protected from mining operations which notification can issue under Rules 31 and 32 by giving limits of the area. The submission of the learned counsel therefore is liable to be accepted that there cannot be a general notification for all monuments. It is obvious that such notifications will be treating all protected monuments with one yardstick, it will be treating unequals with equals and therefore such  interpretation will be violative of protection granted by Article 14 of the Constitution.\t\t [Para 15]"

Since that is the basic requirement of law it is obvious that every such notification will be prospectively applicable whenever it is issued. Such kind of notifications were prohibitory or regulatory and measures adopted by recourse to enactment of that effect have to be prospective in their operation. Such  notifications cannot have any retrospective effect for the simple reason that it will then require demolition of construction already made in the past by recourse to legal means of making such construction. That effect to such notification is not intended by Rule 33 of the Rules of 1959. A cursory reading of the Act of 1958 and Rules of 1959 do specifically spell out the prospectivity of notifications issued thereunder.

Several Nuclear Energy Generating countries have adopted their own Legislation on the issue of Civil and Criminal Liability. The U.S. Price-Anderson Act, 1957, the German Atomic Energy Act (1959), the Swiss Federal Law on the Exploitation of Nuclear Energy for Peaceful Purposes and Protection from Radiation (1959) and the Japanese Law on the Compensation of Nuclear Damage (1961) are some of them. Few of such legislations followed the basic principle of imposing legal liability on a strict liability basis on the operator of a nuclear installation coupled with the limitation on liability. It is unnecessary to multiply the authorities on the principle of strict liability, precautionary principle, polluter pays etc., which find their expression in Articles 21, 47, 48A, 51A(g) of the Constitution of India. \n\nConsidering India's population density and our National Policy for setting up various NPPs in the country, safety and security of the plants are of extreme importance, lest a nuclear accident can cause immense damage both in terms of human life as well as environmental destruction.

                "description": "Establishment of Nuclear Power Project - Overall view of larger public interest rather than smaller violation of right to life guaranteed under Art.21 of the Constitution is to be kept in mind.\n\nThe issue has to be resolved whether the establishment of NPP would have the effect of violating the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 to the persons who are residing in and around Kudankulam or by establishing the NPP, it will uphold the right to life in a larger sense. While balancing the benefit of establishing KKNPP Units 1 to 6, with right to life and property and the protection of environment including marine life, a balance has to be struck, since the production of nuclear energy is of extreme importance for the economic growth of our country, alleviate poverty, generate employment etc. While setting up a project of this nature, An overall view of larger public interest has to be taken rather than smaller violation of right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution.\n\nExperts Committees are of the unanimous opinion that there will not be any deleterious effects due to radiation from the operation of KKNPP, and that adequate safety measures have already been taken. It cannot be forgotten that there are many potential areas of radiation reflected in many uses of radioactive materials. Radioactive materials are used in hospitals, surgeries and so on. Mobile phone use, though minor, also causes radiation. In a report of the Department of Telecommunication \"Mobile Communication - Radio Wave and Safety released in October 2012, it has been stated that a human body is exposed to more electromagnetic field radiation in case of a call from mobile phone in comparison to the radiation from a mobile tower. It is necessary to balance \"economic scientific benefits\" with that of \"minor radiological detriments\" on the touchstone of our national nuclear policy. Economic benefit, has to be viewed on a larger canvas which not only augment our economic growth but alleviate poverty and generate more employment. NPCIL, while setting up the NPP at Kudankulam, have satisfied the environmental principle like sustainable development, corporate social responsibility, precautionary principle, inter - intra generational equity and so on to implement our National Policy to develop, control and use of atomic energy for the welfare of the people and for economic growth of the country. Larger public interest of the community should give way to individual apprehension of violation of human rights and right to life guaranteed under Article 21. \n\nNobody on this earth can predict what would happen in future and to a larger extent it is left to the destiny. But once the justification test is satisfied, the apprehension test is bound to fail. Apprehension is something we anticipate with anxiety or fear, a fearful anticipation, which may vary from person to person. \n\nNuclear power plant is being established not to negate right to life but to protect the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution. The petitioner's contention that the establishment of nuclear power plant at Kudankulam will make an inroad into the right to live guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution, is therefore has no basis. On the other hand it will only protect the right to life guaranteed under Article 21 of the Constitution for achieving a larger public interest and will also achieve the object and purpose of Atomic Energy Act.\n\nPer Dipak Misra, J. :- unless adequate care, caution and monitoring at every stage is taken and there is constant vigil, life of \"some\" can be in danger. That will be totally shattering of the constitutional guarantee enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution. It would be guillotining the human right, for when the candle of life gets extinguished, all rights of that person perish with it. Safety, security and life would constitute a pyramid within the sanctity of Article 21 and no jettisoning is permissible. The delicate balance in other spheres may have some allowance but in the case of establishment of a nuclear plant, the safety measures would not tolerate any lapse. The grammar has to be totally different. I may hasten to clarify that I have not discussed anything about the ecology and environment which has been propounded before us, but the proportionality of risk may not be \"zero\" regard being had to the nature's unpredictability. All efforts are to be made to avoid any man-made disaster. Though the concept of delicate balance and the doctrine of proportionality of risk factor gets attracted, yet the same commands the highest degree of constant alertness, for it is disaster affecting the living. The life of some cannot be sacrificed for the purpose of the eventual larger good.  [Para 175,178,179,181,184,228]"

                "description": "Suit for necessaries supplied to ship - Averments in plaint - Prima facie case raising triable issue - Motion for dismissal of suit cannot be allowed.\n\nCivil P.C. (1908), O.7, R. 11(a).\n\nThe Court has the power under Order 7 Rule 11 (a) of Civil P.C. to reject the plaint at the threshold. But in this case the Court would reject the plaint only if it comes to the conclusion that necessary averments and material have not been placed before the Court to show, at least prima facie, that defendant had entered into the contract for bunkers at the instance, authority or faith of the vessel or its owners. In the event the court comes to the conclusion that necessary averments have been made to disclose a cause of action in personam against the owner of the vessel, then it would not be necessary to decide the question of law raised that for an action in rem to lie it is essential that the owner of the vessel is liable in personam. It would be necessary to decide this question only if the Court comes to the conclusion that necessary averments have not been made to disclose a cause of action in personam against the owner. Having perused the plaint and the documents which are made available, prima facie it could be held that the necessary averments have been made by the plaintiffs to raise a triable issue with regard to the bunkers being supplied to the owners. Therefore, it would not be necessary to decide the questions of law at this stage. This is not the kind of case where the Court can come to the conclusion, at this interlocutory stage, that there are no averments showing that the bunkers have been supplied to the ship on the alleged authority of the owner.  [Para 4]\n\nA perusal of clause 21 of the contract shows that the agreement is entered into expressly on the faith and credit of the vessel. It is agreed and acknowledged that a lien on the vessel is thereby created. It is also agreed that the buyer, if not the owner of the vessel, warrants that he has the authority of the owner to pledge the vessel's credit. It also states that he will give notice of the provisions of this clause to the owner. Prima facie, without going into the merits or evidentiary value of the documents, it could be held that the Plaintiffs are perfectly within their right to claim on the basis of the combined reading of confirmation of nomination together with paragraph 21 of the General Terms and Conditions of Sale that the necessaries/bunkers were supplied at the instance/authority of the vessel/owners. Thus, at this stage it would not be possible to hold that the contract has not been entered into by defendant on behalf of the owners of the vessel. This issue will have to be finally decided on the basis of the evidence which will be adduced at the final hearing of the case. Reading the aforesaid averments together it cannot be said that the plaintiffs have not stated that the supply of necessaries were not made to the owners of the vessel. So, even if the Court proceeds on the basis that action in rem lies only if the owner is liable in personam, the defendant cannot succeed at this stage. Thus the suit could not be dismissed at this threshold.  [Para 4]\n\nThe phrase \"does not disclose a cause of action\" has to be very narrowly construed. Rejection of the plaint at the threshold entails very serious consequences for the plaintiff. This power has, therefore, to be used in exceptional circumstances. The Court has to be absolutely sure that on a meaningful reading of the plaint it does not make out any case. The plaint can only be rejected where it does not disclose a cause of action or where the suit appears from the statements made in the plaint to be barred by any provision of the law. While exercising the power of rejecting the plaint, the Court has to act with utmost caution. This power ought to be used only when the Court is absolutely sure that the plaintiff does not have an arguable case at all. The exercise of this power though arising in Civil Procedure, can be said to belong to the realm of criminal jurisprudence and any benefit of the doubt must go to the plaintiff, whose plaint is to be branded as an abuse of the process of the Court. This jurisdiction ought to be very sparingly exercised and only in very exceptional cases. The exercise of this power would not be justified merely because the story told in the pleadings was highly improbable or which may be difficult to believe.  [Para 5]\n\nIt is no doubt true that the High Court has inherent powers by virtue of Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, Letters Patent and Article 215 of the Constitution of India to prevent the abuse of its process. It is axiomatic that greater the power, greater the caution in exercise thereof. This power has been specifically incorporated in Order 6 Rule 16 (c) of the Code of Civil Procedure after 1-2-1977. It has been exercised on very rare occasions. It is an abuse of the process when facts germane to the issue are either not disclosed to the Court or are misstated. However, all inaccuracies will not lead to the dismissal of the case. The inaccurate facts must enable the plaintiff to obtain relief which they would not have obtained if they had stated the correct facts.  [Para 8]\n\nIn the circumstances it can be held that there has been no suppression of any fact which would make plaint liable to be rejected.  [Para 8]"

That right is enforceable against the vessel.  But existence of a right in the Plaintiffs against the owner of the vessel, is a must.  In so far as the present case is concerned, averments in the plaint do not disclose any existing right in the Plaintiffs against the owner of the vessel.  In the present case, it is clear that there were two independent contracts in relation to purchase of oil.  There was one contract between the owner of the Defendant No.1/ vessel and M/s.North End Oil Pvt.Ltd., whereby the owner of the Defendant No.1/ vessel agreed to purchase oil at the stated price from M/s.North End Oil Ltd., and the second contract was between M/s. North End Oil Pvt.Ltd. and the Plaintiffs, whereby M/s.North End Oil Pvt.Ltd. agreed to purchase oil from the Plaintiffs at a stated price.  The price of oil in both these contracts is different.  In so far as, the purchase of oil by the owner of the Defendant No.1/vessel is concerned, there is no privity of contract between the Plaintiffs and the owner of the Defendant No.1/ vessel.  Not only that but even a demand of the price was made by the Plaintiffs from M/s.North End Oil Pvt.Ltd. and the Plaintiffs have also lodged their claim with M/s.North End Oil Pvt.Ltd.  The first Defendant has produced on record receipts which show that the owner of the first defendant vessel has already made payment of price of oil to M/s.North End Oil Pvt.Ltd.  It is further to be seen here that in case the Plaintiffs claim against the Defendant No.1/ vessel and its owner is held to be maintainable, then the owner of the defendant No.1/ vessel would be liable to pay price of the oil to two parties, namely M/s.North End Oil Pvt.Ltd. as also the Plaintiffs.  Adopting such course of action would not amount to advancing justice.  Supply of necessity would not make the owner of the vessel liable to pay the price of the supply, unless the Plaintiffs prove that the supplies were made at the instance of either the owner of the vessel or at the instance of the person authorised by the owner of the vessel.A.I.R.1993 SC 1014 - Followed.

The action taken was an action in rem against the vessel.  The lien agreed by member and the association cannot be described as maritime lien.  What constitutes Maritime liens as has now been set out by the Apex Court in the case of m.v. Won Fu 2002 AIR S.C.W. 4409.  Maritime liens are as under :\n\n(a)  damage done by a ship\n\n(b)\t salvage\n\n(c)\t seamen's and master's wages\n\n(d)\t master's disbursement; and\n\n(e)\t bottomry.\n\nA maritime claim is distinguishable from a maritime lien which is carried with the res and can be enforced against the res even if there be change of ownership.  It adheres to the ship from the time that the fact happens, to give a maritime lien and then continues binding the ship upto it being dislodged.  2002 AIR SCW 4409 - Followed.   [Para 6]"

Such power is to be exercised by the Chairman on his own motion or on the application of any of the parties after notice to the parties, and after hearing such of them as he may desire to be heard. The Chairman may, on his motion, transfer any case pending before one Bench to another without notice. \t [Para 58]\n\n\tA careful reading of Section 25 of the Act makes it clear that the Chairman deciding the question of whether a matter should be transferred from one Bench to another cannot grant interim stay of proceedings, their being no power conferred on the Chairman under the said section to pass such interim stay. \t [Para 59]\n\n\tPower under Section 24 to grant interim orders has been conferred on the Tribunal, and/or in other words, a Bench of the Tribunal in seisin of proceedings in respect of which the Bench is entitled to exercise the jurisdiction and powers of the Tribunal. \t [Para 60]\n\n\tA Tribunal created under the Act as also its Chairman derives its powers from the Act and can only exercise such powers as are conferred by the Act. The Chairman of the Tribunal exercising its power under Section 25 of the Act does not function as a Tribunal. \t\t\t\t [Para 61]\n\n\tA careful reading of the provisions of the Act and in particular Sections 14 and 15 thereof in juxtaposition with Article 323A of the Constitution leaves no manner of doubt that an Administrative Tribunal constituted under the Act to give effect to Article 323A of the Constitution exercises all the jurisdiction powers and authority exercisable by all the Courts before commencement of the Act and has all the attributes of a Court of law except that it is not bound by the strict rules of procedure embodied in the Civil Procedure Code or the strict rules of evidence prescribed by the Evidence Act, as observed above. All norms of judicial propriety and judicial discipline apply as much to the Tribunal as to Courts including the High Court. \t [Para 62]\n\n\tA judicial order passed by a Tribunal is binding on all concerned, including the Tribunal itself on its administrative side, unless set aside or modified by a higher forum in exercise of appellate or revisional powers. In no circumstance, can a judicial order of a Bench of the Tribunal be nullified or rendered nugatory by its Chairman. \t [Para 63]\n\n\tIn view of Section 12 of the Act, the Chairman of the Tribunal can only exercise financial and administrative powers over the Benches as may be vested under the Rules. The Chairman may thus constitute Benches, shift members from one Bench to another, constitute Single Benches, Division Benches and even larger Benches, allocate business to the Benches and even transfer cases from one Bench to the other, but having done so he cannot interfere with the functioning of the Benches or tinker with its orders by passing interim orders in a transfer petition. \t [Para 64]\n\n\tIn any case, judicial decorum and propriety demands that a judicial order, ad interim, interim or final be vacated, varied, modified, recalled or reviewed by a Bench of coordinate strength or larger strength or a higher forum, but not a smaller Bench of lesser strength, except in cases where such authority to a lower forum and/or smaller Bench is expressly conferred or implicit in the order sought to be vacated, varied, modified, recalled or reviewed. \t\t\t [Para 65]\n\n\tThe Chairman, like the Chief Justice of the Higher Courts or the Chief Judge of subordinate courts, may be higher in order of protocol and may have additional administrative duties and responsibilities. However, the Chairman, acting judicially, is equal to any other Member. The Chairman, being one amongst equals, could not have stayed proceedings pending before a larger Bench.\n\n1994 ALLMR ONLINE 1131, 1976 ALLMR ONLINE 332 (S.C.), (2001) 4 SCC 448 Ref. to.  [Para 73]"

In our view the Legislature has used this expression consciously. The expression 'Term' signifies a fixed period or a determined or prescribed duration. The word 'term' when used in reference to the tenure of office, means ordinarily a fixed and definite time. There is a distinction between the words 'term' and 'tenure' as applied to a public officer or employee. The 'term', as applied to an office, refers to a fixed and definite period of time.

                "description": "Expression \"extendable by one more term of five years\" - It means total period for which a Member can hold the office is for a period of 10 years only.\n\nThe expression 'extendable', that finds a place in the sub-section, could only mean that the term of office of an incumbent as a member of the Tribunal can be extended if the parties agree. The proviso appended to the sub-section again carves out an exception to the main provision and restricts a member for holding office after he has attained the age of sixty five years. The proviso takes care of a situation where a member whose term of office is extended for a further period of five years cannot hold such office if he has attained the age of 65 years during the extended period of five years. A combined reading of both parts of Section 8(2) of the Act clearly demonstrates that a member of a Tribunal can hold such office for a fixed and definite period of time, i.e. for a period of five years from the date on which he enters upon his office and that period may be extended for one more term of five years. What is contended is that there is neither prohibition nor any embargo for a member who has completed 10 years as Member to participate in the selection process for being appointed as a Member of the Tribunal for another term of five years. This, is impermissible since the total term that a person can hold the office of the Member of the Tribunal is only for a period of 10 years. Where the Legislature clearly declares its intent in the scheme of a language of Statute, it is the duty of the Court to give full effect to the same without scanning its wisdom or policy and without engrafting, adding or implying anything which is not congenial to or consistent with such express intent of legislature. Hardship or inconvenience cannot alter the meaning employed by the Legislature if such meaning is clear on the face of the Statute. If the Statutory provisions do not go far enough to relieve the hardship of the member, the remedy lies with the Legislature and not in the hands of the Court.\t\t\t\t\t\t   [Para 26]"

The proviso, if read plainly, the only conclusion that could be reached is that the Chairman and Members appointed prior to Amendment Act 1 of 2007 on completion of either their term of service or on attainment of 65 years in the case of Chairman or 62 years in the case of Members of the Tribunal, whichever is earlier, may be considered for fresh appointment. If they are eligible in terms of Section 8 of the Amended Act that only means if a member has not completed 10 years term as a member of the Tribunal, he is eligible for fresh appointment, provided he has not completed 65 years of age. The proviso makes it abundantly clear that such fresh appointment could be done provided they satisfy the criteria prescribed under the amended Section 8 of the Act and further, it is made subject to the condition that the total term of office of the Chairman shall not exceed 5 years and that of the Member, ten years. [Para 27]\n\nThe acceptance of the contention would lead to a situation where a person who has been a Member of the Tribunal for 10 years would have to start at the bottom of the ladder as a fresh appointee. A statute is designed to be workable, and the interpretation thereof by Court should be to secure that object unless crucial omission or clear direction makes that end unattainable.

In the absence of evidence to show that such a distance could cause loss of visibility and audibility, out right rejection of his evidence is improper. Moreover, the witness blurted out about such distance by his approximation without measurement thereof.\n\nNot only that the Tribunal has reappreciated the evidence as if it is an appellate authority but appears to have applied incorrect standard of proof for substitution of its own conclusion/finding. In Departmental Enquiry the standard of proof required is only of \"preponderance of probability\". There cannot be a requirement of proof beyond doubt as appears to have been expected by the Tribunal. Even in the case of a criminal trial the requirement is of proof beyond a reasonable doubt but the Tribunal appears to have applied standard of proof reaching to the hilt i.e. reaching point \"beyond doubt\". Needless to say the Tribunal has committed jurisdictional error while reappreciating the whole facts and reaching its own conclusions on application of erroneous yardstick of required amount of proof in the Departmental Enquiry. It follows that the findings of the Tribunal are improper and incorrect due to such wrong approach.\n\nThe Tribunal had no jurisdiction to reappreciate the evidence and set aside the order of the Disciplinary Authority. The Respondent was not prejudiced, in any way, due to non-observance of Rule 9(21) in stricto-sensu since he was fully aware of the circumstances which appeared against him and could have offered himself for examination or might have explained the circumstances through his written statement.

The scheme was framed in the year 1996 principally along with the Arbitration Act which is brought into force on 28.08.1996. The scheme so referred has been framed even before the Arbitration Act was brought into force. There is no other provision under the Act which deals with the payment of costs for processing request and/or even for the Court Fees Act- Central as well as State Act provide for requisite Court Fees and/or process fee for filing any application in the Court and/or before the appropriate forum.\n\nWhen the scheme was framed it was probably on the foundation that the order would be administrative order and therefore certain costs or process fee is required to be paid by the applicant. But now if it is a judicial order [in view of 2006(1) ALL MR 156 (S.C.)] and even otherwise, parties are entitled to invoke S.11 of the Arbitration Act, the requisite court fee and/or process fee need to be paid and/or deposited by the parties as per the respective rules. The question is requirement of direction to deposit the costs for processing.\n\nSection 89 of Code of Civil Procedure also provides for appointment of Arbitrator by Court being one of the alternative mode of settlement of dispute pending in the Court. There is nothing to show that such costs and/or process fee is required to be paid by the parties in those proceedings. Though scheme is different yet, the costs for processing for appointment of Arbitrator under Section 11 of the Arbitration Act is not contemplated under the Arbitration Act and/or even under the Court Fee Act and/or any specific rules except the Scheme of 1996, which had been framed prior to the judgment in S.B.P. & Co.case and not amended till date. \n\nHowever, it is made clear that as on today, unless pointed out otherwise and as there is no challenge at any point of time to the orders passed by the Court directing the parties to deposit the process fee and as most of the parties have complied it, it cannot be said that the same is illegal and/or impermissible. However, an immediate attention is required from all sources to bring in force common scheme and/or rules to avoid further complications in the matter apart from delay in constituting the Tribunal for want of deposit of such process fee.\n\n2006(1) ALL MR 156 (S.C.)
