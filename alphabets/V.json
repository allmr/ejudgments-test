The broad principle of interpretation, with respect to treaties, and provisions therein, would be that ordinary meanings of words be given effect to, unless the context requires or otherwise. However, the fact that such treaties are drafted by diplomats, and not lawyers, leading to sloppiness in drafting also implies that care has to be taken to not render any word, phrase, or sentence redundant, especially where rendering of such word, phrase or sentence redundant would lead to a manifestly absurd situation, particularly from a constitutional perspective.

The question whether a service is a public utility or not, will have to be decided in the context of different situations. As far as the facts in the instant case are concerned, it cannot be denied that the Municipal Corporation is a statutory body which undertakes to provide services to the public at large. Under the provisions of the MRTP Act it also functions as a Planning Authority. One of the functions of the Corporation is to provide streets in the municipal area. Section 291 confers powers on the Municipal Corporation to declare any road as a public street. Upon such declaration, the property vests in the Municipal Corporation and such road is open for the use of the general public. Rule 22(5) also confers power on the Municipal Commissioner to require the owner of the adjoining plot to surrender a part of his property for the purpose of access to the land-locked property. Therefore in the larger sense the action of the Municipal Commissioner is referable to a public utility. Under Article 31 of the Vienna Convention relating to consular relations expropriation of the consulate property is permissible for public utility provided all possible steps are taken to avoid impeding the performance of consular functions and prompt, adequate and effective compensation is paid to the sending State. We have already seen that under rule 22(5) read with the circular of 18th January 1996 and section 291 of the BMC Act, the owner of the property is entitled to compensation. Further he is entitled to proportionate reduction in compulsory open space. Consequently, the question of impeding the consular functions does not arise.  [Para 25]\n\nAn acquisition can be for a public purpose even though all the members of public do not take benefit but only a section of it take the benefit. Public purpose in acquisition may be served even though acquisition is for the benefit of particular members of the public provided the object of acquisition is a public purpose.\n\nAIR 1960 Kerala 321 and AIR 1960 Mad 108 Relied on.
