The concept of child in the womb has got limited application to the extent of a partition of a joint Hindu family property. The concept of child in the womb is not within the realm of the Tenancy Act, 1948 for the reason that the Tenancy Act has given a right to the tenant of becoming a deemed purchaser on the tillers day and it is only in circumstances detailed in section 32-F, the right to purchase is postponed i.e. in case the landlord is a minor, widow, or under mental or physical disability. Apart from the said provision there is no provision in the statute which impedes the right of the tenant of being deemed purchaser on the tillers day. The plain and literal construction of Section 32-F is unambiguous. In the present case, the petitioner on the tillers day was not a minor or a widow or a person subject to any mental or physical disability. Minor is defined under the Indian Majority Act i.e. a person who has not attained the age of 18 years and is in cases where superintendence is assumed by the Court of wards, 21 years. Section 4 of said Act lays down that while computing the age day on which he was born is to be excluded. Thus even viewing the term minor as per Indian Majority Act, a person should have been born on tillers day then only his age can be computed from the said date. When the provision is clear and unambiguous then literal construction of the said section will have to be taken and if it is assumed that the child in the womb is also to be interpreted as part of section 32-F, then that would be doing violence to the phraseology of said section. The same would not be permissible. As such, the joint family contemplated under the Tenancy Act, 1948 would not embrace a concept of 'child in the womb. On this count it will have to he held that the petitioner is not the landlord and had no right or authority to issue the notice for recovery of rent or for determination of tenancy. The reading of the provisions conjointly, the only interpretation that can be drawn is that a 'child in the womb' cannot be considered to be a member of a joint family for the purpose of Tenancy Act, 1948.

Defendant however denied ownership of vessels except vessel 'A' and also denied plaintiff's claim that other vessels are sister vessels of 'A' Further as per amended claim of plaintiff himself, defendant along with one entity named BLT was beneficial owner of the vessels which formed part of their fleet and that defendant was wholly owned subsidicry of BLT.\n\nHeld, just because BLT owns incorporated companies, and each of companies owned different ships does not make all the ships sister ships and does not entitle any claimant to seek arrest of a ship owned by particular entity for a claim against a ship owned by another entity just because both the entities are subsidiaries of a third entity. In view of Art.3(2) of International Convention on Arrest ships, 1999, the vessels if not owned by the same person liable for maritime claim do not become sister ships and what is important is the registered owner of the vessels should be the same entity. Further according to Indian Law, shareholders are not the owners of the assets of the company. Therefore arrest of the ship not owned by the person liable for maritime claim is not permissible unless fraud is established and it is not case of plaintiff that BLT had created, all those companies to own individual vessel with a view to mask the fraud. Plaintiff's case therefore not sustainable.  [Para 12,36,39]"

                "description": "Passing of insolvency resolution - Right of members of suspended board of directors of corporate debtor to participate in meetings of Committee of Creditors (CoC) - In view of statutory scheme of Insolvency Code though erstwhile Board of Directors are not members of CoC, they have a right to participate in each and every meeting held by CoC and also have a right to discuss along with members of CoC all resolutions plans presented at such meetings u/S.25(2)(i) - They have also right to get all relevant documents including insolvency resolution plans - As regards confidential information, resolution professional can take an undertaking from members of erstwhile Board of Directors to maintain confidentiality. \n\n\tStatutory scheme of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (2016), makes it clear that though the erstwhile Board of Directors are not members of the committee of creditors, yet, they have a right to participate in each and every meeting held by the committee of creditors, and also have a right to discuss along with members of the committee of creditors all resolution plans that are presented at such meetings under Section 25(2)(i). It cannot be gainsaid that operational creditors, who may participate in such meetings but have no right to vote, are vitally interested in such resolution plans, and must be furnished copies of such plans beforehand if they are to participate effectively in the meeting of the committee of creditors. This is for the reason that under Section 30(2)(b), repayment of their debts is an important part of the resolution plan qua them on which they must comment. So the first important thing to notice is that even though persons such as operational creditors have no right to vote but are only participants in meetings of the committee of creditors, yet, they would certainly have a right to be given a copy of the resolution plans before such meetings are held so that they may effectively comment on the same to safeguard their interest. \t [Para 9]\n\n\tIt is also important to note that every participant is entitled to a notice of every meeting of the committee of creditors. Such notice of meeting must contain an agenda of the meeting, together with the copies of all documents relevant for matters to be discussed and the issues to be voted upon at the meeting vide Regulation 21(3)(iii). Obviously, resolution plans are \"matters to be discussed\" at such meetings, and the erstwhile Board of Directors are \"participants\" who will discuss these issues. The expression \"documents\" is a wide expression which would certainly include resolution plans.\t [Para 13]\n\n\tUnder Regulation 24(2)(e), the resolution professional has to take a roll call of every participant attending through video conferencing or other audio and visual means, and must state for the record that such person has received the agenda and all relevant material for the meeting which would include the resolution plan to be discussed at such meeting. Regulation 35 makes it clear that the resolution professional shall provide fair value and liquidation value to every member of the committee only after receipt of resolution plans in accordance with the Code [see regulation 35(2)]. Also, under Regulation 38(1)(a), a resolution plan shall include a statement as to how it has dealt with the interest of all stakeholders, and under sub-clause 3(a), a resolution plan shall demonstrate that it addresses the cause of default. This Regulation also, therefore, recognizes the vital interest of the erstwhile Board of Directors in a resolution plan together with the cause of default. It is here that the erstwhile directors can represent to the committee of creditors that the cause of default is not due to the erstwhile management, but due to other factors which may be beyond their control, which have led to non-payment of the debt. Therefore, a combined reading of the Code as well as the Regulations leads to the conclusion that members of the erstwhile Board of Directors, being vitally interested in resolution plans that may be discussed at meetings of the committee of creditors, must be given a copy of such plans as part of \"documents\" that have to be furnished along with the notice of such meetings.\t [Para 14]\n\n\tAs a result of the aforesaid discussion, the arguments of the respondents that \"committee\" and \"participant\" are used differently, which would lead to the result that resolution plans need not be furnished to the erstwhile members of the Board of Directors, must be rejected. Equally, the Regulations, far from going beyond the Code, flesh out the true intention of the Code that is achieved by reading the plain language of the Sections that have already been adverted to. So far as confidential information is concerned, it is clear that the resolution professional can take an undertaking from members of the erstwhile Board of Directors, as has been taken in the facts of the present case, to maintain confidentiality. The source of this power is Regulation 7(2)(h) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Board of India (Insolvency Professionals) Regulations, 2016, read with paragraph 21 of the First Schedule thereto. This can be in the form of a non-disclosure agreement in which the resolution professional can be indemnified in case information is not kept strictly confidential.\t [Para 15]"

(1908), O.9 R.13 - Ex-parte award - Powers of Labour Court/Tribunal to set it aside - Even after expiry of 30 days mentioned in S.17A of ID Act, Labour Court/Tribunal does not become functus officio - Ex-parte award can still be set aside, on sufficient cause being shown - There are certain inherent, ancillary and incidental powers vested in every Tribunal to do justice - In exercise of those powers and on broader principles contained in Order IX Rule 13 of CPC, Labour Court/Tribunal can set aside ex-parte award even after its becoming enforceable.\n\n\tIn case a party is in a position to show sufficient cause for its absence before the Labour Court/ Tribunal when it was set ex parte, the Labour Court/Tribunal, in exercise of its ancillary or incidental powers, is competent to entertain such an application. That power cannot be circumscribed by limitation. What is the sufficient cause and whether its jurisdiction is invoked within a reasonable time should be left to the judicious discretion of the Labour Court/Tribunal.\n\n\tIt is a matter of natural justice that any party to the judicial proceedings should get an opportunity of being heard, and if such an opportunity has been denied for want of sufficient reason, the Labour Court/Tribunal which denied such an opportunity, being satisfied of the sufficient cause and within a reasonable time, should be in a position to set right its own procedure. Otherwise, as held in Grindlays [1980 (Supp) SCC 420], an award which may be a nullity will have to be technically enforced. It is difficult to comprehend such a situation under law.\n\n\tMerely because an award has become enforceable, does not necessarily mean that it has become binding. For an award to become binding, it should be passed in compliance with the principles of natural justice. An award passed denying an opportunity of hearing when there was a sufficient cause for non-appearance can be challenged on the ground of it being nullity. An award which is a nullity cannot be and shall not be a binding award. In case a party is able to show sufficient cause within a reasonable time for its non-appearance in the Labour Court/Tribunal when it was set ex parte, the Labour Court/Tribunal is bound to consider such an application and the application cannot be rejected on the ground that it was filed after the award had become enforceable. The Labour Court/Tribunal is not functus officio after the award has become enforceable as far as setting aside an ex parte award is concerned. It is within its powers to entertain an application as per the scheme of the Act and in terms of the rules of natural justice. It needs to be restated that the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 is a welfare legislation intended to maintain industrial peace. In that view of the matter, certain powers to do justice have to be conceded to the Labour Court/Tribunal, whether we call it ancillary, incidental or inherent.\n\n2005(5) ALL MR 344 (S.C.)

In case of industrial dispute relating to dismissal or discharge of an employee, arbitrator would be powerless in granting relief of reinstatement outside I.D. Act.  Another feature is voluntary arbitration provided for under S. 10A of I.D. Act. Section 10 A provides detailed procedure on how arbitration there under shall proceed, which includes mandatory forwarding of arbitration to appropriate government and Conciliation Officer. Thus Section does not entirely leave matter in hands of parties to arbitration agreement and private fora of their choice. This shows that industrial dispute is not treated solely as industrial dispute but is always approached from context of larger picture of industry as whole.

It defines the word \"interest\" to mean interest on loans and advances.  Section 2(7) must be read with the expression \"unless the context otherwise requires\".  Section 26C provides evidence of the expression \"unless the context otherwise requires\".  Therefore, section 26C demolishes the argument of the Department that the word \"interest\" means interest on Dated Government Securities.  One has to read Section 2(7) with section 26C and, if so read, interest received from RBI on Dated Government Securities will not fall within the meaning of the expression \"Interest on loans and advances\" under section 2(7) of the Act.  Accordingly, the Department was not entitled to levy interest tax on Rs.15,69,41,050/- received from RBI during the year 1993-94 on Dated Government Securities as it would mean levy of tax indirectly on RBI under section 26C of the Act.

Under the impugned Order, it has been held by the Revisional Authority that under Section 20 of the Act, the Revisional Authority cannot allow the assessee to raise a claim for the first time, particularly when the assessee has offered the said amount of Rs.15,69,41,050/- to tax.  This finding of the Revisional Authority is erroneous.  In this case, the assessee has raised a question, which goes to the root of the matter.  The point at issue before the Revisional Authority was not concerning a legality of the Order of the AO, but it was concerning lack of authority/jurisdiction.  In our view, interest tax was not leviable on the interest received from RBI on Dated Government Securities and consequently, the issue raised concerns lack of authority/jurisdiction on the part of the AO under the Interest Tax Act to levy tax on such interest.  Therefore, such an issue was entertainable under Section 20 of the Interest Tax Act.\t\t\t\t [Para 6]"

The undertaking therefore, is a word having wider meaning and it connotes not only printing press but also other properties of the firm Shivraj Fine Art Works.  It is to be noted that as per provisions of Indian Partnership Act, 1932, the individual proprietors of partnership firm are also answerable for claims against the partnership firm.  In this background when prayer (A) is perused it used the word private properties of partnership firm.  The registered firm is not separate legal entity and it is adventure of individuals to earn and share profits.  It cannot therefore have private properties and other properties as sought to be propounded and the type of distinction artificially created by petitioners is not supported by any law.  The fact which therefore emerges is that the godowns in question are also the properties of partnership firm.  When Section 4 of Maharashtra Act No.XXXVI of 1984 is looked into, it covers all the properties and there is deeming fiction in it.\n\nIt is, therefore, clear that all properties of the firm are included within the sweep of phrase \"undertaking\" and this is also apparent from Section 2(1) which defines \"proprietors\". Section 3(l) clearly states that the right, title and interest of the proprietors in relation to their undertaking shall, by virtue of this Act, stands transferred and vests absolutely in State Government.  All assets of firm even under control of proprietors is therefore comprehended in the undertaking by Section 4(1) above.  Therefore, the question whether property is being used or has not been used actually for the purpose of printing press or for the purposes of firm namely Shivraj Fine Art Litho Works is not relevant at all for these purposes.  Section 10 casts an obligation on persons incharge of management of undertaking to deliver all assets of the firm and Section 11 also casts an obligation upon him to account for all such assets.  The distinction sought to be made by the petitioners in this respect is not in existence and not contemplated by the Scheme of Maharashtra Act No.XXXVI of 1984.   [Para 10]"

The four specified factors on the basis of which the power may be exercised are as follows :\n\na)\tthe smallness of the number of workers employed, or\n\nb)\tthe amount invested in any industrial undertaking, or\n\nc)\tthe desirability of encouraging small undertakings generally, or\n\nd)\tthe stage of development of any scheduled industry.\n\nA plain reading of Section 29-B shows that having regard to the stage of development of any schedule industry if the Central Government is of the opinion that there should be an exemption from some or all of the provisions of the Act, it can issue an appropriate notification for this purpose. Sub-section 2 of the Section 29-B also confers upon the Central Government an express power of cancellation of such exemption. In our opinion sufficient guidelines have been provided by the legislature for the Government in this connection. The power conferred under Section 29-B is not tainted by the vice of excessive delegation because the essential legislative policy is specified in the preamble to the IDR Act and is writ large throughout the provisions of the Act. The grounds on which exemption from licensing can be granted - one of them being the stage of development of the industry - are also specified in Section 29-B. The legislative policy having been clearly stated, there is no excessive delegation.   [Para 29,30]"

Supreme Court, time and again, has observed that any substantive law shall operate prospectively unless retrospective operation is clearly made out in the language of the statute. Only a procedural or declaratory law operates retrospectively as there is no vested right in procedure.\n\nIn the absence of any express legislative intendment of the retrospective application of the Act, and by virtue of the fact that the Act creates a new liability of a high rate of interest against the buyer, the Act cannot be construed to have retrospective effect. Since the Act envisages that the supplier has an accrued right to claim a higher rate of interest in terms of the Act, the same can only be said to accrue for sale agreements after the date of commencement of the Act, i.e. 23rd September 1992 and not any time prior.\n\n(2005) 13 SCC 19 - Rel. on.

Ss.3, 4, 5 does not envisage multiple proceedings - Hence action by way of reference cannot be restricted to claim for recovery of interest due only in cases of admitted liability.\n\nThe word 'due' has variety of meanings, in different context it may have different meanings. In its narrowest meaning, the word 'due' may import a fixed and settled obligation or liability. In a wider context the amount can be said to be 'due', which may be recovered by action. The amount that can be claimed as 'due' and recoverable by an action may sometimes be also covered by the expression 'due'. The expression 'amount due from a buyer' followed by the expression 'together with the amount of interest' under sub-section (1) of Section 6 of 1993 Act must be interpreted keeping the purpose and object of 1993 Act and its provisions, particularly Sections 3, 4 and 5 in mind. This expression does not deserve to be given a restricted meaning as that would defeat the whole purpose and object of 1993 Act. Sub-section (1) of Section 6 provides that the amount due from buyer together with amount of interest calculated in accordance with the provisions of Sections 4 and 5 shall be recoverable by the supplier from the buyer by way of suit or other proceeding under any law for the time being in force. The scheme of Section 6 of 1993 Act read with Sections 3, 4 and 5 does not envisage multiple proceedings as canvassed. Rather, whole idea of Section 6 is to provide single window to the supplier for redressal of his grievance where the buyer has not made payment for goods supplied or services rendered in its entirety or part of it or such payment has not been made within time prescribed in Section 3 for whatever reason and/or for recovery of interest as per Sections 4 and 5 for such default. It is for this reason that sub-section (1) of Section 6 provides that 'amount due from the buyer together with the amount of interest calculated in accordance with the provisions of Sections 4 and 5' shall be recoverable by the supplier from buyer by way of a suit or other legal proceeding. Sub-section (2) of Section 6 talks of a dispute being referred to IFC in respect of the matters referred to in sub-section (1), i.e. the dispute concerning amount due from a buyer for goods supplied or services rendered by the supplier to buyer and the amount of interest to which supplier has become entitled under Sections 4 and 5. It is true that word 'together' ordinarily means conjointly or simultaneously but this ordinary meaning put upon the said word may not be apt in the context of Section 6. Can it be said that the action contemplated in Section 6 by way of suit or any other legal proceeding under sub-section (1) or by making reference to IFC under sub-section (2) is maintainable only if it is for recovery of principal sum along with interest as per Sections 4 and 5 and not for interest alone? The answer has to be in negative. Word 'together' in Section 6(1) would mean 'alongwith' or 'as well as'. Seen thus, the action under Section 6(2) could be maintained for recovery of principal amount and interest or only for interest where liability is admitted or has been disputed in respect of goods supplied or services rendered. Under Section 6(2) action by way of reference to IFC cannot be restricted to a claim for recovery of interest due under Sections 4 and 5 only in cases of an existing determined, settled or admitted liability. IFC has competence to determine the amount due for goods supplied or services rendered in cases where the liability is disputed by the buyer.  (2004)3 SCC 447 - Rel.on.   [Para 34]"

                "description": "Term appeal - Has a wide range of connotations - Not necessary that exercise of appellate jurisdiction will always involve re-agitation of entire matrix of facts and law - Term need not be necessarily interpreted within meaning of that word in CPC - Hence term 'appeal' would include application under S.34 of Arbitration Act as well. Arbitration and Conciliation Act (1996) S.34.\n\nAn \"appeal\" is a term that carries a wide range of connotations with it and that appellate jurisdiction can be exercised in a variety of forms. It is not necessary that the exercise of appellate jurisdiction will always involve re-agitation of entire matrix of facts and law. Even an order passed by virtue of limited power of revision under Section 115 of the Code is treated as an exercise of appellate jurisdiction, though under that provision, the Court cannot go into the questions of facts. There is no quarrel that Section 34 envisaged only limited grounds of challenge to an award; however, there is no reason why that alone should take out an application under section 34 outside the ambit of an appeal especially when even a power of revision is treated as an exercise of appellate jurisdiction by Apex Court and the Privy Council.  (1969)2 SCC 74, (2001)3 SCC 341 - Rel.on.   [Para 32]\n\nIf the word 'appeal' is not construed as including an application under section 34 of Arbitration Act, it would render the term 'award' redundant and the requirement of pre-deposit a total nullity with respect to all case where a Small Scale Industry undertaking preferred arbitral proceedings, prior to the incorporation of the reference procedure in 1998. Arbitration necessarily has to result in an award. The only way of challenging an award in a Court, in accordance with section 5 read with the opening clause of section 34 is filing an application under the latter section. If such challenge is not construed as an 'appeal', the requirement of pre-deposit of interest before the buyer challenging an award passed against him, becomes a total nullity. The fact that an order passed on such application/challenge under section 34 is appealable under section 37 is of no consequence.   [Para 42]\n\nIt is true that in almost all definitions of 'appeal', there is reference to removal of a cause from an inferior Court to a superior Court. It is also trite that an arbitrator deriving his authority from a private agreement does not fit into the ordinary hierarchy of Courts. However, an appeal need not necessarily lie from an inferior Court to a superior Court, especially within the meaning of Section 7, for the following reasons:\n\n1)\tSection 7 itself uses the term 'before a Court or other Authority.' Hence, the inter se relation between an Arbitrator and Court is not relevant for the purpose of interpreting S.7. If an appeal can lie only from an inferior court to a superior Court, the words 'other authority' in S.7 will be rendered redundant. The terminology of the section indicates that it is intended to cover a wide range of judicial/non-judicial determinations and challenges instituted therefrom before Courts or any other authority empowered to entertain such challenge.\n\n2)\tSection 37(2) provides for appeals from arbitral tribunals. Thus it is not impossible to have appeals lying from arbitral tribunals to Courts.\n\n3)\tThough practically unknown in India, there are two tier arbitration mechanisms known to other jurisdictions. These contemplate appeal from an arbitral award to yet another appellate arbitral tribunal. The arbitrator and the appellate arbitral tribunal do not constitute inferior and superior Courts, but a challenge instituted against the award passed by the former before the latter is treated as an 'appeal' nonetheless.\n\n4)\tThere are other legislations in which the term 'appeal' is used when Courts are not is the context of reference. For instance, under the Right to Information Act, 2005 an appeal lies from the other of the Central/State public information officer to a senior official of higher rank. These officials, no doubt, can not be called Courts.  2006(5) ALT 647 - Overruled.   [Para 46]\n\nThe Interest Act is a beneficial piece of legislation intended to expedite timely payment of money owed to Small Scale Industries. Most of the contracts of supply or sale that Small Scale Industries enter into contain arbitration clauses. These arbitration proceedings result in an 'award'. If the term 'appeal' is interpreted in the limited context of a 'decree of order' and as excluding an application to set aside or remit such awards, the very purpose behind the enactment of Interest Act will be defeated.\n\nHence keeping in mind the language of Section 7, object of the legislation and the contextual meaning of the term appeal, we are, therefore, of the view that the term \"appeal\" appearing in Section 7 of the Interest Act should include an application under Section 34 as well.

Thus, a member appointed to the All India Service has no right to be allocated to a particular State cadre or Joint cadre, but he has a right to a fair and equitable treatment in the matter of allocation under Articles 14 and 16(1) of the Constitution..   [Para 9,10]\n\nIn the instant case as against a total of 29 vacancies 9 OBC candidates (4 insiders + 5 outsiders) had been allocated to the Andhra Pradesh cadre from amongst the successful candidates of Civil Services Examinations from 1994-2003 and if the respodent, an insider OBC candidate, was to be allocated to the Andhra Pradesh cadre from the selected candidates of the Civil Services Examination, 2004, a total of 10 OBC candidates would be allocated to the Andhra Pradesh cadre in the 30 point roster, making the percentage of OBC candidates to 33 1/3, which was a variation of 6% in excess and by any standard was not a marginal variation.. Hence, the impugned order of the High Court quashing the allocations and directing reconsideration of their allocation will not have cascading effects on the service because the High Court has only quashed the allocation of only two members of the IPS,  and not of other members of the IPS and directed reconsideration of their allocation.

                ],
                "description": "Criminal P.C. (1973), S.482 - Misbranding of insecticide - Prayer for quashing of proceedings - On ground that Insecticide Inspector sent the sample for analysis without institution of any proceeding - Held, Insecticide Inspector has ample power to send sample for testing or analysis to CIL on his own even before filing of a formal complaint against named accused - Criminal proceedings against accused cannot be quashed.\n\n\tInsecticide Inspector is empowered to take samples of any insecticide and send such samples for analysis to the Insecticide Analyst for testing in the prescribed manner. The manner of dispatch of samples for test or analysis is prescribed in Rule 34. It predicates as to how each sample is required to be sent by registered post or by hand in a sealed packet together with a memorandum set out in Form XII in an outer cover addressed to the Insecticide Analyst. As per sub-section (5) of Section 22, if the Insecticide Inspector decides to take a sample of an insecticide for the purpose of test or analysis, he is obliged to intimate such purpose in writing in the prescribed form to the person from whom he takes it and, in the presence of such person unless he willfully absents himself, he shall then divide the sample into three portions and effectively seal and suitably mark the same and permit such person to add his own seal and mark to all or any of the portions so sealed and marked. After that, the Insecticide Inspector is expected to restore one portion of a sample so divided or one container as the case may be, to the person from whom he takes it and retain the remainder and deal with same in the manner prescribed in sub-section (6) of Section 22. Out of the remainder, one portion or container is required to be sent for Insecticide Analyst Test or Analysis. The second portion is required to be produced before the Court where the proceedings if any are instituted in relation to the said insecticide. As noted earlier, the analysis of the sample can be obtained from either the Insecticide Analyst appointed under Section 19 or the CIL established under Section 16 of the Act.\t [Para 11]\n\n\tOn a bare reading of sub-section (3) of S.24, it is seen that the first part declares that the report signed by the Insecticide Analyst shall be evidence of the facts stated therein and it shall be conclusive, unless the \"person from whom\" the sample was taken exercises his right by notifying in writing within the specified time that he intends to adduce evidence in controversion of that report. Thus, the second part of this provision gives a right to the person from whom the sample was collected to raise an objection. Once the person from whom the sample was taken exercises that right in terms of sub-section (4), the conclusiveness of the report of the Insecticide Analyst (State Analyst) referred to in the first part of the same provision cannot be used against such person. These provisions are in the nature of rules of evidence. Further, if the criminal complaint is launched and the person is named as an accused, he can request the concerned Magistrate before whom the proceedings are pending to send the third sample produced before the Court to the CIL for testing or analysis. That right can be exercised only if the complaint is founded on the report of the State Insecticide Analyst. However, if the complaint is filed also on the basis of the report of the CIL, then the question of exercising the right under Section 24 (4) does not endure to the accused. For, the purport of Section 24(4) is that the report of the CIL shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated therein. It is pertinent to bear in mind that the opening part of sub-section (4) of Section 24 opens with the words, \"Unless the sample has already been tested or analysed in the CIL\". Therefore, in cases where such report is already obtained or available, the criminal prosecution must proceed on that basis. In other words, only if the analysis report of the CIL is not available or filed along with complaint or placed on record in the criminal prosecution, would the accused get a right to request the concerned Magistrate to direct testing or analysis of the third sample produced before that Court by the prosecution from the CIL and not otherwise. Any other view would entail in rewriting of the provisions, which are otherwise plain and unambiguous. Thus, if the report of the CIL has been obtained before filing of the complaint or pursuant to the direction given by the concerned Magistrate and made part of record of the criminal prosecution, as in this case, the accused named in the complaint cannot ask for analysis of the sample already used at the instance of the person from whom it was taken and is named as co-accused. The provisions of the Act predicate that the Insecticide Inspector has ample power to send the sample for testing or analysis to the CIL on his own. Rather, it is his duty to do so if such an express request is made by the person from whom the sample was taken.\t [Para 13,14]"

They agree to pay the damages arising out of any accident by taking a chance that no accident might happen. Motivation of the insurance business is that the premium would turn to be the profit of the business in case no damage occurs. Such business of the insurance company can be carried on only with the premium paid by the insured persons on the insurance policy. The only profit, if at all the insurance company makes, of the insurance business is the premium paid when no accident or damage occurs. But to ask the insurance company to bear the entire loss or damages of somebody else without the company receiving a pie towards premium is contrary to the principles of equity, though the insurance companies are made liable to third parties on account of statutory compulsions due to the initial agreement, entered between the insured and the company concerned.\t [Para 8]\n\nIn a contract of insurance when an insurer gives a cheque towards payment of premium or part of the premium, such a contract consists of reciprocal promise. The drawer of the cheque promises the insurer that the cheque, on presentation, would yield the amount in cash. It cannot be forgotten that a cheque is a Bill of Exchange drawn on a specified banker. A Bill of Exchange is an instrument in writing containing an unconditional order directing a certain person to pay a certain sum of money to a certain person. It involves a promise that such money would be paid. Thus, when the insured fails to pay the premium promised, or when the cheque issued by him towards the premium is returned dishonoured by the bank concerned the insurer need not perform his part of the promise. The corollary is that the insured cannot claim performance from the insurer in such a situation.\t\t   [Para 17,18]\n\nHowever, if the insured makes up the peremium even after the cheque was dishonoured but before the date of accident it would be a different case as payment of consideration can be treated as paid in the order in which the nature of transaction required it. As such an event did not happen in this case the insurance company is legally justified in refusing to pay the amount claimed by the respondents.\t\t\t [Para 20]"

In the present case, it was evident from the chain of events that the fire was the efficient and active cause of the damage. Had the fire not occurred, the damage also would not have occurred and there was no intervening agency which was an independent source of the damage. Hence conclusion of the surveyors that the fire was not the cause of the damage to the machinery of the claimant cannot be sustained.

Section 38 as it now stands gives the insurer the discretion to decide whether or not to accept a transfer or assignment of an Insurance Policy. The Amendment Act, according to its Statement of Objects and Reasons, is \"An Act further to amend the Insurance Act, 1938 and the General Insurance Business (Nationalisation) Act, 1972 and to amend the Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority Act, 1999.\" It is thus neither a declaratory or clarificatory piece of legislation. The language of the extant Section 38 cannot be interpreted to mean that this is what Section 38 had meant all along. Furthermore, had the Legislature intended to amend Section 38 retrospectively, it would have said so explicitly. Instead, it has incorporated sub-section (9), which protects rights and remedies of assignees that arose prior to the commencement of the Amendment Act. It is thus clear that Parliament intended to allow all previous assignments and transfers provided that they complied with the requirements laid out in Section 38. In the face of this clear legislative intent, no other interpretation of Section 38 is possible.  [Para 13]\n\nIt is not open to LIC to charter a course which is different to the postulation in the Insurance Act by means of its own circulars.The position that obtains today is diametrically opposite inasmuch as the statute permitted, at the relevant time, the assignment and/or transfer of life insurance policies, but the delegate, through its Circulars, has attempted to nullify that provision of law. We conclude, therefore, that the circulars are ultra vires the Statute and must therefore be made ineffectual. it is not appropriate to import the principles of public policy, which are always imprecise, difficult to define, and akin to an unruly horse, into contractual matters. The contra proferentem rule is extremely relevant inasmuch as it is the Appellant who has drafted the insurance policy and was therefore well-positioned to include clauses making it specifically impermissible to assign policies. In the absence of any such covenant, the Appellant cannot be heard to say that such transfers or assignments violate public policy. In any event, the general global practice is to permit assignments of insurance policies.  [Para 14,15]"

Be that as it may, the fact that the glider was motorised would not imply that it was not an aircraft at all. Even the TSBC Report unequivocally refers to the glider as an \u201caircraft\u201d repeatedly. Importantly, the terms \u201caircraft\u201d and \u201cglider\u201d have not been defined within the Policy. In such circumstances, the glider in question must be regarded as an aircraft under the Policy. (Para 8)\n\nNo rigid distinction can be culled out between \u201cstandard\u201d and \u201cnonstandard\u201d aircraft. The usage of as vague a phrase as \u201cstandard type of aircraft\u201d in the Policy, thus, suggests that the same must be construed in a liberal manner so as to benefit the insured had the insurer really intended to exclude gliding activity from the purview of the Policy, it could have done so expressly, similar to the manner in which hanggliding and paragliding were excluded in Clause 7(xiii) of the Policy. Similarly, the insurer could have also defined the phrase \u201cstandard type of aircraft\u201d for the purpose of the Policy, but it chose not to do so. In these circumstances, it is not open to the insurer to reject a claim arising out of a glider accident by now arguing that a glider is not a standard aircraft by virtue of not principally being a powered aircraft. Therefore regardless of whether the glider involved in the accident was powered or nonpowered, motorised or nonmotorised, it was a \u201cstandard type of aircraft\u201d envisioned in the Policy. (Para 9)\n\nFurther there was no evidence of a licence being required in respect of each aircraft/ glider, and the private registration undertaken with respect to the glider in question, in addition to the municipal business licence, was sufficient compliance with the requirement of the aircraft being duly licensed moreover here was specific finding in the TSBC Report that the glider was certified, equipped and maintained in accordance with existing regulations and approved procedures, and compliant with rules such as the Visual Flight Rules. The Report further observes that even the pilot of the glider was certified and qualified for the flight as per existing regulations, indicating that such separate glider pilot licence was in accordance with the legal requirements. Thus, we conclude that it was rightly held that the aircraft in question was duly licensed. (Para 10)\n\nThe Pemberton Soaring Centre giving out air craft on hire for aerial jourcy was an air charter company within the meaning of clause of the Insurance Policy. (Para 11)\n\nFurther it cannot be said that the deceased was not a passenger merely because the journey was supposed to begin and terminate at the same location + Needless to say, the purpose of the journey was to fly over various scenic spots, and after completion, the glider was to return to a designated location, presumably from where it took off. this would not be dissimilar to how a sightseeing bus might originate and terminate its journey at the same spot after passing by various places of interest. We find it difficult to conclude that a person undertaking such a journey would not amount to a \u201cpassenger\u201d. Further, it was evident from the record that the journey on the glider was undertaken for a fixed consideration, though the ticket for the same has not been placed on record. Thus, it can be said that the deceased was a farepaying passenger on the glider in question. (Para 12)\n\nTherefore, the accident of glider causing death of deceased out of which the instant claim arose was completely covered under the ambit of the Policy, since the deceased was travelling in a duly licensed standard type of aircraft, which brings him out of the exclusion in Clause under policy, and was travelling as a farepaying passenger in a flight of an air charter company, bringing him out of the scope of the exclusion in Clause. Thus in facts, repudiation of claim by insuance company was not proper. (Para 13)"

The present case relates to a mediclaim policy, which is entirely different from a life insurance policy. A mediclaim policy is a non-life insurance policy meant to assure the policy holder in respect of certain expenses pertaining to injury, accidents or hospitalizations. Nonetheless, it is a contract of insurance falling in the category of contract uberrimae fidei, meaning a contract of utmost good faith on the part of the assured. Thus, it needs little emphasis that when an information on a specific aspect is asked for in the proposal form, an assured is under a solemn obligation to make a true and full disclosure of the information on the subject which is within his knowledge. It is not for the proposer to determine whether the information sought for is material for the purpose of the policy or not. Of course, obligation to disclose extends only to facts which are known to the applicant and not to what he ought to have known. The obligation to disclose necessarily depends upon the knowledge one possesses. His opinion of the materiality of that knowledge is of no moment.  (1996)6 SCC 428 - Rel.on.\t\t\t\t\t\t   [Para 12]"

                ],
                "description": "Claim for compensation under \"Transit Marine Insurance Policy\" - Policy purchased by claimant to cover transportation of Helicopter from Canada to Bhopal, India - Helicopter transported in \"knocked down state\" by air to New Delhi - Shifted to hangar at New Delhi - Helicopter assembled at hangar for further transportation, to fly to Bhopal - In inspection window of crew door reported damaged - Helicopter stored in hangar awaiting replacement of spare window - After one month of custom clearance, on inspection tail boom of helicopter found to be damaged - Claim for compensation under insurance policy - Held, deviation of assembling of Helicopter and storing at hangar at New Delhi by claimant for commercial convenience, was at variance with \"ordinary course of transit\" - Resulting into end of insurance, since risk associated with assembled Helicopter was not covered within purview of policy - Therefore, claim seeking compensation from insurance company for wrongful repudiation of claim and towards loss sustained, liable to be dismissed.\n\nThe respondent-claimant purchased a \u201cTransit Marine Insurance Policy\u201d from the appellant on 21 July 2005, to cover the transportation of a Helicopter from Langley, Canada to Bhopal, India. The helicopter was transported in a knocked down state by air to New Delhi. On 13 October 2005, the helicopter was cleared by the customs and was shifted to a hangar at New Delhi. On 21 October 2005, the helicopter was inspected by a representative of the manufacturer during routine inspection and the window of the crew door was reported to be damaged. The respondent sought the permission of the Director General of Civil Aviation to fly the helicopter to Bhopal but was denied permission on account of the damage to the window of the crew door. By a letter dated 22 October 2005, the respondent informed the appellant of the damage and stated that the helicopter was \u201cbeing assembled at the Hangar of Indamer Co. located at Delhi so that the Helicopter can fly from Delhi to Bhopal\u201d. On 23 November 2005, i.e. one month after customs clearence the respondent informed the appellant, that upon inspection, the tail boom of the helicopter was found to be damaged. The respondent, claimant filed consumer complaint seeking compensation from insurance company for wrongful repudiation of claim and towards loss sustained by it.\n\nHeld, the transit policy only covered such risks that may have arisen by the venture or operation being carried out in the usual or ordinary manner and did not include risks that were out of the scope of the policy. Change in the character of the helicopter from a knocked down state to a ready to fly state exposed the appellant to risks not contemplated by the parties under the policy. The effect of the alteration of the subject-matter insured is outside the scope of the agreed cover and brings an end to the policy. Once the nature of the subjectmatter was altered, the cargo cannot be said to be in transit and the appellant is absolved from any liability arising out of any subsequent damage to the consignment. Exposure to risks associated with the flight substantially and unnecessarily added to the risks of the journey that were not covered by the policy. Accordingly, the plea of the respondent that the cover against risks would be provided till the time the helicopter was not delivered at the final destination of Bhopal is unsustainable. Once the respondent intended to alter the subjectmatter it becomes irrelevant to determine whether the hangar at New Delhi was a transit store or the final destination of delivery. (Para 29)\n\nThe purpose of a transit policy is to cover the carriage of goods to the final destination. In the present case, storage of the helicopter in the hangar at New Delhi awaiting replacement of the spare window cannot be said to be incidental or in furtherance of the carriage of the goods to the ultimate destination. It would be unreasonable to suggest that the transit policy intended to cover indefinite storage of the helicopter at the hangar in New Delhi not brought about by the requirements of transport but determined by commercial convenience of the respondent. The degree of deviation of storing the helicopter at the hangar awaiting replacement of the spare window is at variance with the ordinary course of transit. Ordinary course of transit is the period when the cargo is in the course of transportation, and not in the immediate control of the buyer or seller. After the goods cleared customs, the helicopter was in possession of the respondent and it took a voluntary decision of retaining the helicopter in New Delhi on the basis of commercial convenience. The intention of the respondent was not to prepare the helicopter for transportation by road to Bhopal but to assemble the helicopter in New Delhi and fly it to Bhopal. Once the respondent decided to leave the goods in the hangar at New Delhi for its commercial convenience not associated with or in furtherance of the requirements of their carriage to Bhopal, the transit insurance ended. The purpose of the marine transit insurance policy is to cover the consignment from risks associated with transportation of the consignment from one place to another. It is fundamental for those responsible for carrying the cargo to ensure that all stages of the transportation are effected with reasonable promptness. \u201cIn transit\u201d, however, does not necessarily mean that the consignment needs to be in continuous motion at all times. A mere brief suspension must however be in furtherance of the ordinary course of transit. During the ordinary course of transit, the consignment might frequently come to rest or be temporarily stored in the dock awaiting loading or customs clearance. However, unduly protracted steps in the cargos transportation are not within, and may terminate, the \u201cordinary course of transit.\u201d (Paras 30, 31)\n\nFurther the respondent has on the balance of probabilities failed discharge its burden that the damage to the helicopter incurred during the course of transit. No proximate cause has been shown between the damage to the helicopter and the helicopter being in a state of transit. Hence, it cannot be concluded that the damage to the helicopter incurred during the course of transit.. Therefore claim for compensation for damages liors to helicopter by respondant would be liable to be dismissed. (Para 38)"

It is true that the effect of the transfer or assignment would be a novation of the contract, but such a novation is expressly recognised by law. By operation of law the insurer is bound to accept the transfer and/or endorsement, if notice is given to the insurer and the procedure followed. Considering the terminology of the Section, it is not open to the insurer, to dispute the right of the insured to transfer or assign the policy and/or the right of the assignee pursuant to the transfer or assignment to have interest in the policy. Once the transfer or assignment is effected and noted, it is the assignee alone, in the terms of the transfer deed who has complete interest. In fact the definition of the Policy holder under sub-section (2) of Section 2 includes a person to whom the whole of the interest of the policy-holder in the policy is assigned once and for all, but does not include the assignee thereof whose interest in the policy is defeasable or is for the time being subject to any condition. The Insurance Act, therefore, treats the assignee as the policy holder if the policy is assigned once and for all. Once the insured transfers or assigns the policy in favour of the assignee the assignment is complete between them. The provisions of the Section leave no doubt that the insurer has no choice but to accept the transfer or assignment as the case may be if the procedure required by Section 38 has been followed, but subject to the terms of the policy. Section 38 is substantive and not procedural. The position in law, therefore, would be that the interest in the policy earlier held by the assignor is transferred to the assignee with all benefits attached thereto. The assignment becomes binding on the insurer recording the fact of such transfer or assignment.  [Para 16]\n\nOnce the policy has been transferred to the assignee it is the assignee who becomes the policy holder. Such policy holder would be bound by the terms of the policy including the effect of the death of an insured. If such assignee seeks to claim benefit inspite of the death of the original insured, in our opinion, to that extent, the assignee would only be entitled to the benefits as on the day of the death of the original insured when the policy becomes payable in terms of the contract.

Alternatively, it can be stated that there must be sufficient ground to disagree with the findings of Surveyor/Surveyors. There is no prohibition in the Insurance Act for appointment of second Surveyor by the Insurance Company, but while doing so, the insurance company has to give satisfactory reasons for not accepting the report of the first Surveyor and the need to appoint second Surveyor.

On a fair reading of the section it is clear that it is restrictive in nature. It lays down three conditions for applicability of the second part of the section namely :- (a) the statement must be on a material matter or must suppress facts which it was material to disclose; (b) the suppression must be fraudulently made by the policy holder; and (c) the policy holder must have known at the time of making the statement that it was false or that it suppressed facts which it was material to disclose. Mere inaccuracy of (or) falsity in respect of some recitals or items in the proposal is not sufficient. The burden of proof is on the insurer to establish these circumstances and unless the insurer is able to do so there is no question of the policy being avoided on ground of misstatement of facts. The contracts of insurance including the contract of life assurance are contracts uberrima fides and every fact of material must be disclosed, otherwise, there is good ground for rescission of the contract. The duty to disclose material facts continues right up to the conclusion of the contract and also implies any material alteration in the character of the risk which may take place between the proposal and its acceptance. If there are any misstatements or suppression of material facts, the policy can be called in question. For determination of the question whether there has been suppression of any material facts it may be necessary to also examine whether the suppression relates to a fact which is in the exclusive knowledge of the person intending to take the policy and it could not be ascertained by reasonable enquiry by a prudent person.   [Para 12]\n\nIn course of time the Corporation has grown in size and at present it is one of the largest public sector financial undertakings. The public in general and crores of policyholders in particular look forward to prompt and efficient service from the Corporation. Therefore the authorities in-charge of management of the affairs of the Corporation should bear in mind that its credibility and reputation depend on its prompt and efficient service. Therefore, the approach of the Corporation in the matter of repudiation of a policy admittedly issued by it should be one of extreme care and caution. It should not be dealt with in a mechanical and routine manner.  [Para 16]"

In a contract of insurance, any fact which would influence the mind of a prudent insurer in deciding whether to accept or not accept the risk is a material fact. If the proposer has knowledge of such fact, she or he is obliged to disclose it particularly while answering questions in the proposal form. An inaccurate answer will entitle the insurer to repudiate because there is a presumption that information sought in the proposal form is material for the purpose of entering into a contract of insurance.\t\t\t\t [Para 25]"

In a contract of insurance, there is requirement of uberimma fides i.e. good faith on the part of the insured. Except that, in other respects, there is no difference between a contract of insurance and any other contract. The four essentials of a contract of insurance are, (i) the definition of the risk, (ii) the duration of the risk, (iii) the premium and (iv) the amount of insurance. Since upon issuance of insurance policy, the insurer undertakes to indemnify the loss suffered by the insured on account of risks covered by the insurance policy, its terms have to be strictly construed to determine the extent of liability of the insurer. The endeavour of the court must always be to interpret the words in which the contract is expressed by the parties. The court while construing the terms of policy is not expected to venture into extra liberalism that may result in re-writing the contract or substituting the terms which were not intended by the parties. The insured cannot claim anything more than what is covered by the insurance policy.  (1999)6 SCC 451, (2004)8 SCC 644-Rel. on.  [Para 15]"

                "description": "Contract of life insurance - Proposal of life insurance along with passport as proof of age submitted on 20-4-1981 - Corporation issuing suspense memo on 2-5-1981 acknowledging receipt of money towards first premium - Corporation asking for standard proof of age which was submitted in the form of School Leaving Certificate on 18-5-1981 - Insured dying on 21-5-1981 - Held, there was concluded contract on 18-5-1981 i.e. prior to death of insured though it was communicated to plaintiff belatedly on 26-6-1981.\n\nThe Acceptance letter indicates that the defendant Insurance Company has accepted the table 14 term 29 premiums. This clearly is on the basis of the School Leaving Certificate which was received by the Defendant company on 18th May, 1981. It must therefore necessarily be presumed that the contract of insurance became effective from 18th May, 1981 and not from 22nd June, 1981 as stated in the acceptance letter. In fact, according to the plaintiff, the contract of Insurance must be held to have retrospectively come into effect from the date when the proposal was submitted (i.e. 20th April, 1981). It must be remembered that the proposal of insurance along with Passport as proof of age was submitted on 20th April, 1981 and the defendants issued their suspense memorandum dated 2nd May, 1981 acknowledgment receipt of a sum of Rs.471/- towards of first premium including misc. expenses. This by itself would have amounted to concluded contract but for the Table term of insurance stated in the proposal which was 14-29. However, since the proposer had only submitted his passport, a non-standard proof, the defendants did not issue the policy requiring the plaintiff to produce standard proof as evidence of age to entitle him to table terms 14-29. The said SLC having been submitted on 28th May, 1981, there was no impediment to concluding the contract of insurance. The delay in communicating the acceptance is on the part of the Insurance Company. The insured cannot be made to suffer due to any internal delays and/or defects in the procedure in issuing insurance policy which is a formal expression of contract which had already come into existence prior to the death of the deceased proposer. The defendants company is carrying on business of assuring lives and claims an exclusive right to do so. The business of Life Insurance consists in providing social security meant for the community. The Corporation must be guided in its dealings with the public with a social sense of justice. It cannot be the Corporation's policy to raise frivolous objections to avoid policy claims. No doubt, the Corporation is governed by statute and the claims are to be processed as per the rules laid down in the Life Insurance Corporation Act. The facts as set out above clearly make out the case that there was a concluded contract of insurance prior to the death of the insured which occurred on 21st May, 1981. The defendants have communicated their acceptance of the proposal, on 26th June, 1981 though they received the SLC certificate from the plaintiff through their agent on 18th May, 1981 i.e. before the death of the proposer. Since there was a concluded contract of insurance as on 18th May, 1981 which was communicated to the plaintiff, albeit belatedly, the defendant Insurance Company is liable to honour its commitment under the contract of Insurance.

After obtaining possession, if the same is fraudulently retained it will amount to misdemeanor. The employee covenanted that for not vacating possession of staff quarter when called upon he would be guilty of wrongful restraint. Wrongful restraint of property will amount to misdemeanor.  [Para 8]\n\nS.43(2) of the L.I.C.Act entitled the Central Government to apply certain provisions of the Insurance Act to the Corporation subject to such conditions and modifications as may be specified in the notification by which those provisions have been applied. The Central Government, by notification No. G.S.R. 734 dated 23-8-1958, apart from other sections, applied the provisions of Sections 102 to 106 of the Insurance Act to the Corporation. Section 105 of the Insurance Act deals with wrongfully obtaining or withholding of the property of the insurer by any director, managing agent, manager or other officer or employee of an insurer.\n\nS.49(1) contains general provisions for framing regulations by the Corporation and like such time the regulations are framed, there is no bar for the corporation to issue instructions for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of the Act. The Act provides for resorting to criminal action against an employee who illegally retains possession of the property of the Corporation. The Corporation could under the instructions provide for lesser penalty than the one contained in Section 105 of the Insurance Act which has been made applicable to the Corporation by Notification dated August 23, 1958.

The Convention in clear terms provides that in such a case, the security to be provided will be lower of the two amounts i.e., the security will be the value of the arrested vehicle. On the other hand Section 443(1) of the M.S. Act does not contemplate any such situation and merely provides that the High Court which has ordered arrest of the ship at the instance of the plaintiff (whose property has been damaged by the defendant ship) will indicate the security which the owner of the defendant ship has to give to the satisfaction of the High Court. The words \"to pay all costs and damages that may be awarded in any legal proceedings that may be instituted in respect of the damage\" merely contemplates the maximum amount for which the High Court will ask the defendant to give security. There is nothing in Section 443(1) of the Act which indicates that the Legislature had contemplated a situation where value of the arrested ship was less or substantially less than the plaintiff's claim in the Admiralty Suit. In view of the above discussion, there does not appear to be any conflict between Article 4 of the 1999 Convention on the one hand and Section 443(1) of the M.S. Act. A familiar approach in all such cases is to find out which of the two apparently conflicting provisions is more general and which is more specific. Hence when value of the arrested vessel is less than the plaintiff's best arguable case in an Admiralty Suit for damages, the value of security which the Admiralty Court may call upon owner of the arrested vessel to furnish will not exceed value of the arrested vessel as independently assessed.

Thus we are of the opinion that MSO 25 and 26 do not infringe Article 14 of the Constitution.  [Para 6]\n\nModel Standing Order 25(6) provides adequate guidelines to the employer when exercising his discretion. It provides that he should take into account both extenuating or aggravating circumstances of the case. The Manager has to apply his mind to the gravity of the offence and the previous record. thus it cannot be said that this Model Standing Order gives uncanalised or unbriddled powers to the Manager to impose any punishment. In any particular case when this power is misused it can always be challenged in appropriate proceedings. This in itself is not sufficient to render the Model Standing order ultra vires Article 14.

Before the employer seeks to take action for asserting that consequence, there has to be due compliance with the principles of natural justice. The requirement of natural justice must be read into the provisions of the Certified Standing Orders. The Certified Standing Orders have a statutory flavour under the Industrial Employment Standing Orders Act, 1946. Where the civil rights of an individual are adversely affected, the requirement of fairness warrants that an opportunity consistent with the principles of natural justice should be given to him. Now, an opportunity in a manner which is consistent with the principles of natural justice does not necessarily warrant the holding of a full-fledged departmental enquiry. What is required is an opportunity with a view to enable an employee to furnish any explanation he may have for explaining his absence without leave. An employee may have a justifiable reason for absence from duty beyond the period of leave. It is not necessary for Court to catalogue exhaustively the circumstances in which that may be the case. It would, however, suffice to note that the law contemplates as an incident of the requirement of fair treatment that at least a notice should be given to an employee so that he would have an opportunity to explain why he was absent from work. The principles of natural justice are in aid of justice. In a case such as the present, they are intended to protect an employee, should the employee have a plausible reason for his absence from duty.

It is not acceptable for the reason that the enquiry officer cannot travel beyond the charge sheet issued to the delinquent. The enquiry officer is required to conduct an enquiry squarely within the framework of the charge sheet and neither can the management nor would the enquiry officer and the delinquent be permitted to travel beyond the scope of the charge sheet. The onus and burden lies on the management to prove the charges levelled upon the employer. Specific clauses of the Model Standing Orders or the Certified Standing Orders or whichever Rules that may be framed for the said purpose, have to be set out in the charge sheet. The enquiry officer, therefore, has to conclude on the basis of the oral and documentary evidence as to whether the charge levelled upon a delinquent is established or not by the management.\n\n\tThe enquiry officer is only to judge whether the charge of absence without leave or absence without leave for more than ten consecutive days is proved or not. The issue, therefore, is as to whether any application for leave was filed and as to whether the said application has been accepted or rejected. A mere filing of an application for leave and proceeding on leave on the presumption that it may be allowed, is not enough. When an employee files an application for leave, it is his duty to note whether his application has been allowed or not. If the same is allowed, he could proceed on sanctioned leave. If the application is not allowed and if he proceeds to remain absent, it would amount to unauthorized absenteeism required to judge whether the management proves that no application for leave was filed or if filed, was rejected. This could also be done with the assistance of the charge sheeted employee who has every right to prove before the enquiry officer that he had filed a leave application and the same was granted. If it is so proved, the employee would then fall in the second part of the Standing Order 24(f), which is, \"over staying the sanctioned leave without sufficient grounds or satisfactory explanation.\" As such, the role of the enquiry officer considering the two parts under Standing Order 24(f) is well defined and specified. As such, unless it is provided in the Standing Orders, whereby an employee could offer sufficient grounds or proper or satisfactory explanation for not filing a leave application, the said employee cannot try to justify the non-filing of a leave application before the enquiry officer.\n\n2012(4) ALL MR 442 (S.C.), 2009(6) ALL MR 451 (S.C.), 2014 ALL SCR 1972, 2012(7) ALL MR 712, 2000(3) ALL MR 283 Disting. \t\t [Para 29,30,31,32]"

                "description": "Non completion of enquiry within 90 days - Effect of - As per O.25 enquiry should be completed ideally within period of 90 days and if it is not completed, it is permissible for enquiry officer to proceed with conducting enquiry even after completion of 90 days, by recording reasons for it - Failure to record reason will not render enquiry a nullity - Also it would not be an anathema to conduct enquiry beyond 90 days.\n\n Primary consideration while conducting an enquiry is adherence to the principles of Natural Justice and grant of a reasonable and adequate opportunity of defence to the charge-sheeted workman. If a deadline of three months was mandated, there was a possibility of its misuse. It could turn out to be a tool in the hands of an employer to rush through the enquiry in haste and complete it within the time frame of three months. So also, a workman could claim that the enquiry is invalid if conducted beyond three months. It would, thus, be counter-productive. Whether Standing Order 25(4) regarding completion of enquiry within a period of 3 months is a mandatory provision or could it be interpreted to mean a directory provision, is to be seen under the provisions of the Model Standing Orders. Standing Order 25(4), read in tandem with the Proviso thereunder, leaves no room for doubt. In fact, the proviso clearly indicates that if an enquiry cannot be concluded within a period of three months, the enquiry officer can record his reasons in writing and extend the period as may be deemed necessary by him. Failure to record reasons would not be fatal to such proceedings, since what is needed to be ensured is that the parties to the enquiry are given adequate opportunity in defence and the principles of natural justice are adhered to. \n\n\"Enquiry Shall be completed within a period of 3 months\" in Standing Order 25(4) appears to be a mandate. The word \"shall\" is normally interpreted to indicate a mandate. However, the proviso thereof gives liberty to the enquiry officer to extend the enquiry beyond three months for a period as he may deem necessary, but by recording reasons. Standing Order 25 (5-A) enables an employer to place the charge-sheeted employee under suspension, pending enquiry. Standing Order 25(5-A)(i) entitles a suspended workman, subject to the condition of not taking up any employment during the period of suspension, to subsistence allowance. For the first ninety days of the suspension period subsistence allowance is 50% of his normal daily wages. Under Standing Order 25(5-A)(ii), a suspended workman is entitled to subsistence allowance beyond the period of 90 days \"if the enquiry gets prolonged and the workman continues to be under suspension for a period exceeding ninety days\", @ 75% of his normal daily wages. Similarly, under Standing Order 25(5-A) (iii), if the enquiry is not completed within a period for 180 days, the workman shall be entitled to full wages as subsistence allowance. This provision of the Standing Order clearly indicates that though it is desirable to complete an enquiry within a period of 90 days, it would not be an anathema to conduct the enquiry beyond 90 days. The entire scheme under the above referred provisions of the Model Standing Orders clearly indicates the intent and object of law. It emerges that an enquiry, if not completed within 3 months, would neither render it a nullity nor an illegality. Provision of completing the enquiry within a period of three months is directory in nature and not mandatory. It can also be said that it is desirable for the enquiry officer to record his reasons. Failure to do so however will not render the enquiry a nullity.  [Para 12,13,14,15,16,17,18]"

Undoubtedly, it is open to a disciplinary authority to hold that the punishment of dismissal which has been proposed should be reduced having regard to the nature of the misconduct or, for that matter, the past record of the employee which in the present case by all accounts has been regarded as clean. But, equally while reducing the punishment it is not open to the disciplinary authority to impose a punishment which is not prescribed by the certified standing orders. Consequently while the discretion of the disciplinary authority to reduce the punishment cannot be doubted, the authority in doing so is governed by the discipline of the certified Standing Orders and must confine itself to one of the punishments enumerated thereunder. \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 10]"

                "description": "Restricting right of representation to fellow workman of particular establishment - Being fair, reasonable and in consonance with Model Standing Orders, could be certified.\n\nThe basic principle is that an employee has no right to representation in the departmental proceedings by another person or a lawyer unless the Service Rules specifically provide for the same. The right to representation is available only to the extent specifically provided by the Rules.  [Para 27]\n\nModel Standing Orders no doubt, provided that a delinquent employee could be represented in the disciplinary proceedings through another employee who may not be the employee of the parent establishment to which the delinquent belongs and may be an employee elsewhere, though he may be a member of the Trade Union, but this rule of representation has not been disturbed by the Certified Standing Orders inasmuch as it still provides that the delinquent employee can be represented in the disciplinary proceedings through an employee. The only embargo is that the representative should be an employee of the parent establishment. The choice of the delinquent in selecting his representative is affected only to the extent that the representative has to be a co-employee of the same establishment in which the delinquent is employed. There appears to be some logic behind this as a co-employee would be fully aware of the conditions prevailing in the parent establishment, its Service Rules, including the Standing Orders, and would be in a better position, than an outsider, to assist the delinquent in the domestic proceedings for a fair and early disposal. The basic features of the Model Standing Orders are thus retained and the right of representation in the disciplinary proceedings through another employee is not altered, affected or taken away. The Standing Orders conform to all standards of reasonableness and fairness and, therefore, the Appellate Authority was fully justified in certifying the Draft Standing Orders.  [Para 38]"

It would be a contradiction in terms.  We may also draw support from Section 25-B which defines \"continuous service\" as \"uninterrupted service, including service which may be interrupted on account of sickness or authorised leave or an accident or a strike which is not illegal, or a lock-out or a cessation of work which is not due to any fault on the part of the workman\".  The specific exclusion of persons on illegal strike plainly means that the period a person is on illegal strike does not amount to service.  Different considerations would no doubt prevail where the strike is legal.  Workers on strike continue to be in service although they may have ceased work.  If the strike is a legal one such cessation of work or refusal to continue would be absence authorised by law.  Under CSO L-2.12 a presumption is to be drawn against an employee if such employee is unauthorisedly absent.  Clearly, a person on illegal strike and a person on legal strike are both 'absent', but the absence of the first is unauthorised and the second is not.  CSO L-2.12 raises a presumption against the employee and it is for the employee to rebut that presumption by adducing the evidence.  [Para 21]"

The Enquiry Officer, after such a conclusion was recorded by him in his report, forwarded it to the employer and the employer acting on the same has dismissed the respondent from service with effect from 25th November 2002. The employee sought a reference from the Appropriate Government and that is how the matter of his dismissal is referred to the Labour Court and that is how the Court is seized of the matter. The Court cannot be equated with an employer as it is only performing a judicial function of giving an opportunity to the petitioner to adduce evidence to prove charges of misconduct before it, and that is because the law postulates such an opportunity. The law does not equate this situation with suspension by the employer pending domestic enquiry or investigation into any complaints. The Supreme Court decision cannot be extended by analogy to such a situation as that would produce startling consequences. In all such matters merely because the Court grants the employer an opportunity to adduce evidence to prove the charges of misconduct, it will be obliged to direct the employer to pay subsistence allowance to the employee. That would mean that the order of dismissal already passed against the employee is set aside and substituted by his suspension. That would be creating a situation wherein the order of the Court permitting de novo enquiry means an order of suspension of the employee enabling him to claim subsistence allowance. If the charges of misconduct are grave and serious and the employee is already dismissed, then, paying him any subsistence allowance or sustenance allowance which may in a given case be 75% or more of his last drawn wages, would mean that he is allowed to resume work although the employer has already dismissed him. Ultimately, if the dismissal is justified by the employer, then, an order will have to be made directing the employee to bring back the monies already paid. Apart therefrom, allowing him to resume work or in lieu thereof pay him 75% of wages would be putting a premium on his misconduct and in a given case, fraud. That will be in contravention of the object and purpose sought to be achieved by industrial adjudication. \n\nAIR 1964 SC 737; 2004(5) ALL MR 1016 (S.C.) - Ref.  [Para 23,25]"

Maxims - Generalis specialibus non derogant.\n\nThe circular issued by the Electricity Board dt:23-5-2001 relating to transfer of its employees is valid. The circular is not introducing the subject of transfer as a new subject.  What is being done by the circular is certain guidelines are being issued while exercising the powers of transfer and suggesting under what circumstances and situations the transfer would be effected.  If any particular employee is thereby hurt, he has his every remedy open to challenge the same on any special grounds such as malafide etc.  However, it would be incorrect to suggest that by issuing the circular the respondent/Board is in any manner tampering with the items enumerated in the schedule under Section 2-A of 1946 Act.   [Para 24]\n\nThough the Regulations made under Section 79(c) of the Electricity (Supply) Act are statutory in nature, however that could not mean that the same would stand on a high pedestal so as to override the Standing Orders made under the Standing Orders Act.  No doubt, the Statutory bodies are authorities within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution and the employees of these bodies have a  statutory status, it is also no doubt true that the Regulations made under the statutes creating these bodies have force of law, however, that by itself would not be sufficient to hold that the regulations framed under Section 79(c) have to gather more importance than that of the provisions made under the Standing Orders Act which is a special law.   [Para 21]\n\nThe Model Standing Orders are definitely applicable to the employees in the service of the respondent/Board.  Failure on the part of the Board to frame Standing Orders and to get the same certified or duly notified, would not allow the respondent-Board to contend that provisions in respect of subject to which reference is made in the Schedule under Section 2-A of the Act of 1946, would not apply. In this view of the matter it can be said that the provisions of the special Act will prevail in the matter and, therefore, the Board has to comply with the provisions of the Act of 1946.   [Para 23]\n\nIf any industry has to make any provisions about any of the subjects in the Standing Orders, if the Standing Orders are framed or if it is to be tampered with in any manner, what is required is, those regulations are to be got notified either in accordance with Section 13-B if the industry is a government undertaking or it has to be got duly certified by Certifying Officer under Section 5 of 1946 Act. But, when the subject about which a regulation is already framed by the Board or when that particular subject does not form part or is not included in any of the items given in schedule under Section 2-A of the Act then in why it should not be permissible for the Board to issue certain guidelines in respect of the subject which is already included in the regulation is a question.  Restriction is only with regard to the subjects which are included in the schedule and not the subjects which are outside the schedule.  In the matter in hand, the matters which are enumerated in the Standing Orders in respect of those matters only the Act of 1946 will have to be treated as a special Act but the matters not enumerated therein in the cases of those matters, the regulations framed by the Board under Section 79(c) will have to prevail.

Therefore, in terms of Section 12-A of the Standing Orders Act, the Model Standing Orders are deemed to be applicable.  Section 2(f) of the Act defines an employee to include an apprentice, but at the same time makes an exclusion in the case of an apprentice engaged under the Apprentices Act or under the Standing Orders.  Under the Model Standing Orders an apprentice is described as a learner who is paid allowance during the period of training.  In the case at hand, trainees were paid stipend during the period of training.  They had no right to employment, nor any obligation to accept any employment, if offered by the employer.  Therefore, the trainees were 'apprentices' engaged under the 'Standing Orders' of the establishment.  Above being the position, it cannot be said that the concerned 45 trainees were employees in terms of Section 2(f) of the Act.  In other words, an apprentice engaged under the Apprentices Act or under the Standing Orders is excluded from the definition of an 'employee' as per Section 2(f) of the Act.\t [Para 10,11,12]"

The charges may appear simple. The facts stated in the charge-sheet may appear simple. It may not be difficult for the employee to understand the same. Anyone with any experience of litigation before a Civil Court, an Arbitrator or a Tribunal knows that simple facts may require skillful handling which an employee or a person who is not legally trained cannot be expected to be capable of. Skillful and adept handling of facts and law makes all the difference, not merely to the outcome of the matter but to the production of evidence and placing the matter in the correct perspective. Simple facts are handled quite differently, more skilfully by a legally trained person. A lawyer can, by virtue of his training, complicate simple facts and present complicated facts in clear and simple terms. He can complicate simple cases and simplify, over-simply complicated ones. That is the result of his training. There is neither logic nor any justification in denying an employee the benefit of the assistance of a legally trained person where the Management avails of the same. This approach is reinforced by the fact that the scope of judicial review against orders passed in such proceedings are limited. A person denied the assistance of a legally trained person would be at a great disadvantage in seeking judicial review of the orders passed in proceedings where the opposite side has the benefit of a legally trained person. There may be crucial lapses in the decision making process. These may be factors that indicate or establish bias. Considering the scope of judicial review, it is essential that the same are appropriately dealt with, recorded. A legally trained Presenting Officer could well guard against the same appearing on record. It is essential, therefore, that the employee is also granted the assistance of a lawyer to guard against the same.\n\nFurther, the importance or relevance of evidence, documentary or oral, may not be realised by a lay person. A legally trained person would, however, realize the importance thereof. If the Management representative is a legally trained person, he would be able to produce, for the consideration of the Enquiry Officer, the material necessary to substantiate the charges. The importance of such evidence may escape an employee who does not have similar assistance. The necessary evidence not having been produced before the Enquiry Officer, it may be difficult for the employee to sustain a reasonable challenge/judicial review to the action. The scales would be unfairly tipped against the employee leading to an unfair result.  2008(4) ALL MR 447 (S.C.) and 2006(III) FLR 819 - Ref. to.\t [Para 34,37]"

The rule requires that from amongst the outstanding officers, 15 names are to be forwarded to the Central Government, and hence it is possible that amongst these 15, a junior officer may as well figure, depending upon the assessment of his merit. He cannot be eliminated merely on the ground that he is a junior officer, and that if selected he will write the ACRs of his superiors. \n\nIf the rules for selection contain a requirement, the same has to be applied uniformly and strictly, and none from the eligible group can be eliminated from being considered on any criteria, other than those which are provided in the rules. If there is a criteria laid down for selection, the Administration has to confine to the same, and it cannot impose an additional criterion over and above whatever has been laid down.

In the cases at hand, it is not in dispute that all the petitioners had obtained licences for valuable consideration without any notice of the fraud alleged to have been committed by the original licence holders while obtaining licences.  If that be so, the concept that fraud vitiates everything would not be applicable to the cases where the transaction of transfer of licence is for value without notice arising out of mercantile transaction, governed by common law and not by provisions of any statute.\n\nThe effect of fraud is not to render the transaction void ab initio but renders it voidable at the instance of the party defrauded and transaction continues valid until the party defrauded has decided to avoid it. Alternatively, let us consider it from another angle assuming that licence comes to an end upon its suspension and/or cancellation, in catena of cases, it is laid down that the date of import of goods would be the date on which the Bill of Entry was presented under section 46.  This legal position is clear from the decision of the Apex Court as laid down in 1999 (112) ELT 3 (SC) and 1999(113) ELT 358 (SC).  The same is the view taken by of the Apex Court in Sampat Raj Dayar's case.  Imports against replenishment Licences were permitted duty free if the importers produced an import Replenishment Licence the goods or the materials were imported into India.  In the instant cases when the goods were imported into India, and even when the Bills of Entry were filed, neither were the licences suspended nor the same cancelled.  In all these cases, Bills of Entry were filed by the petitioners well before the suspension and/or cancellation of the licences in question, thus the imports were made under valid licences, the goods could not be subjected to levy of customs duty in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case in hand.  1999 (113) ELT 358(SC) and AIR 1962 SC 1893 - Followed.\t [Para 36,37]"

Thus, Rule 9 can be said to be ultra vires the provisions of the IT Act being beyond the delegated power.\n Rule 9 also prima facie appears to be infringing the constitutional guarantee of Freedom of Speech and Expression as conferred by Article 19(1)(a) in subjecting the publishers of news and current affairs content and publishers of online curated content subject to action under the statutory regime of the Press Council Act, PC Act and the CTVN Act, 1995 which provides for an independent mechanism for any violation of the provisions of such legislation. Such transgression of powers occupied by different legislations cannot be disrupted by a subordinate legislation. \n (Para 32) \n Rule 9, prima facie, suffers from two illegalities firstly, it imposes an obligation on the publishers of news and current affairs content and publishers of online curated content, to observe the Code of Ethics under a completely different statutory regime alien to the IT Act, namely, by applying norms of Journalistic Conduct of the Press Council of India under the PC Act and Programme Code under Section 5 of the CTVN Act. Further, Section 87 does not confer any power on the Central Government to frame rules contemplating such provisions under clauses (z) and (zg) of sub-section (2). Thus, it cannot be said that Rule 9 is intended to carry out the provisions of the IT Act. It cannot be overlooked that the two provisions referred to in the \u201cCode of Ethics\u201d, namely, Norms of Journalistic Conduct of the Press Council of India under the PC Act and the Programme Code under Section 5 of the CTVN Act are under different statutory regimes occupying the field for the purposes of those two enactments. It is prima facie difficult to comprehend as to how such fields which stand occupied by independent legislations can be brought within the purview of the impugned rules and substantive action can be taken for their violation under the impugned rules. \n (Para 25) \n Even otherwise, the IT Act does not seek to censor content on the internet, except to the extent mentioned in S.69A thereof. \n Adherence and/or observance of moral standards in the code of journalistic ethics has been exalted to the status of a mandatory compliance. One who violates the code does so at his own peril and would expose himself/itself to more rigorous action than what the PCI Act envisages. It is, therefore, incomprehensible as to how by a subordinate legislation, contravention of such code laying down standards of moral behaviour, could validly be made a ground for attracting action of the nature specified in Rule 14(5) of the 2021 Rules. \n Allowing the operation of the 2021 Rules in its form and substance to operate would result in the writer/editor/publisher standing the risk of being punished and sanctioned, should the inter-departmental committee be not in favour of criticism of any public figure. It is, therefore, quite possible that the writer/editor/publisher on contravention of the provisions of clause (1) of Rule 9 of 2021 Rules, but without even transgressing the boundaries set by clause (2) of Article 19 of the Constitution, may expose himself/itself to punishment/sanction under the 2021 Rules. The indeterminate and wide terms of the Rules bring about a chilling effect qua the right of freedom of speech and expression of writers/editors/publishers because they can be hauled up for anything if such committee so wishes. The 2021 Rules are, thus, manifestly unreasonable and go beyond the IT Act, its aims and provisions. \n Rule 9 does not conform to the statute, namely, of the Information Technology Act as also it is an intrusion into the fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution. Therefore, as an interim relief on the petitions, High Court directed stay of operation of subrules (1) and (3) of Rule 9 of the 2021 Rules. \n (Paras 26, 27, 29, 33)"

That offence is required to be investigated into by a Special Police Force, by virtue of Notifications issued from time to time dated 18th February, 1963 and 7/9th August, 1989 in exercise of powers conferred under the provisions of Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946.  In view of the said Notifications, the offences under the provisions of the Act, can be taken note of, enquired and investigated into only by the Special Police Force authorised in that behalf, being C.B.I.  In that sense, no fault can be found with the investigation of the present case as has been done by the C.B.I. and as the allegations pertain to cognizable offence, it was not necessary to take prior authorisation of the Magistrate for the purpose of investigation.  The question, however, is : Whether the C.B.I. who had investigated into the offence, was obliged to submit police report within the meaning of Section 173 of the Code?  Once again, this question will have to be tested in the context of the provisions of the Act.  There can be no doubt that by virtue of special provision, such as Section 6 of the Act, the Magistrate could take cognizance of such offence only upon a complaint to be filed by an Officer authorised in that behalf by the Central Government, by general or special order.  In other words, the requirement of filing complaint flows from the mandate of Section 6 of the Act.  The Magistrate could take cognizance of offence only upon such complaint being filed and in no other manner.  If it is so, it cannot be said that the C.B.I. was obliged to file police report within the meaning of Section 173 of the Code.  Even if such a report was to be filed, it was not open to the Magistrate to take cognizance of the offence on the basis of such a report.  It is for that reason, the matter has been brought before the Magistrate in the form of a complaint filed by the authorised Officer and the Magistrate proceeded to take cognizance of the offence on the basis of the said complaint given in writing, as the allegations in the complaint did make out offence against the accused to be tried before it.  [Para 18,19,20]\n\nViewed in this perspective, non-filing of police report within the meaning of Section 173 of the Code by the C.B.I. in the fact situation of the present case, will make no difference and that will have no bearing on the validity of the complaint filed by the authorised Officer in writing.  Insofar as the record collected during the investigation of the case by the C.B.I. is concerned, that cannot be treated as evidence in the case which is ignited on the basis of complaint under Section 6 of the Act.  [Para 22]\n\nIf the alleged offence is a non-cognizable offence, the Police cannot take notice of the information, much less, proceed to investigate without seeking prior order of the Court in that behalf and that, on completion of the investigation, it was obliged to file report within the meaning of Section 173 of the Code.

The submission that the provisions of the Civil Procedure Code apply in toto cannot be accepted. It is true that certain provisions of the Civil Procedure code are made applicable to the proceedings conducted before the Labour Court. When such provisions are to be made applicable, they have been specifically mentioned in the Act as well as the Rules. Moreover, the power of the Labour Court to grant stay of the Recovery Certificate on condition that the petitioners deposit the amount is an inherent power. [Para 5]\n\nIn the present case, the Labour Court was satisfied that in order to stay the recovery proceedings certain conditions should be imposed on the petitioners. By directing the petitioners to deposit 50% of the amount awarded alongwith the costs in Court would not in any manner prejudice the petitioners. In fact, if no such order had been made prior to granting stay of the Recovery Certificate, the Labour Court would have done injustice to the workman. In the event, the workman succeeded in the matter they would have again to run from pillar to post in order to recover the amount payable to them. By directing the petitioners to deposit the amount in Court, the Labour Court had merely avoided this. Assuming that the petitioners had a good case on merits, no prejudice would have been caused to them if the amount had been deposited in the Court since there was no direction from the Labour Court allowing the respondent-workman to withdraw the amount. [Para 6]\n\nThere is no doubt that the Labour Court has jurisdiction to set aside the ex-parte order. Whether such an Award or Order should be set aside unconditionally is for the Labour Court to decide at its discretion. In the instant case, the Labour Court, while considering whether the stay should be granted unconditionally, has considered the fact that the petitioners employer had remained absent despite receipt of notice as well as intimation sent through the Court. They had also remained absent before the Commissioner of Labour when directed to appear before him on three occasions when the recovery certificate was issued. It was only thereafter that Recovery proceedings were initiated against them. The Labour Court has given cogent reasons for allowing the stay application on condition that the petitioners deposit the amount as directed. [Para 9]"

The provisions of Section 33-A (b) of the Act speak of a complaint by an employee aggrieved by the contravention of Section 33 to an Arbitrator, Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal and empower these authorities to adjudicate upon the complaint as if it were a dispute referred to or pending before it. Under Section 33-A (b) of the Act, the Labour Court, Tribunal or National Tribunal is empowered to pass an award after adjudicating the complaint pending before it. There is a clear distinction between the provisions of Section 33-A (a) and Section 33-A (b) of the Industrial Disputes Act. Section 33-A (a) does not give any adjudicatory power to the Conciliation Officer and provides that the Conciliation Officer shall take the complaint filed by the employee into account while mediating in and promoting the settlement of the industrial dispute, whereas, Section 33-A (b) of the Act empowers the Arbitrator, Labour Court, Tribunal, or National Tribunal to adjudicate upon the complaint pending before it in accordance with the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act and also pass an award therein. It is, thus, clear from the provisions of Section 33-A that though the arbitrator, Labour Court, Tribunal, or National Tribunal is empowered to adjudicate upon the complaint as if it were a dispute the Conciliation Officer is not empowered to adjudicate upon the complaint. The Conciliation Officer is only empowered to consider the complaint and take it into account while mediating in and promoting the settlement of the industrial dispute. The provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act, specially the provisions of Section 33-A, do not empower the Conciliation Officer to adjudicate the complaint filed by the employee for the alleged contravention of the provisions of S.33 of industrial disputes Act by the employer.\n\nAIR 1955 SC 258, 2011(2) ALL MR 657 Rel. on.

After the expiry of thirty days, the Award would become enforceable thereby consequentially rendering the Court/Tribunal which delivered the award, \"FUNCTUS OFFICIO\". On the date the Award becomes enforceable, the Court/Tribunal would lose jurisdiction over the reference proceedings.\n\n\tIn the light of the above and since the Rules framed under the Central Act are \"Hand Maid\" to the provisions of the Act, the effect of Sections 17 and 17A of the Central Act would render the words, \"within thirty days of the receipt of a copy thereof\", in Rule 26(2) insignificant for the reason that after thirty days of the publication of the Award, the Award becomes enforceable and the Court/Tribunal becomes \"FUNCTUS OFFICIO\".\n\n\tBy way of an illustration, if an Award dated 1st of January, 2015 is published on 1st of March, 2015, the Award would not become enforceable till 31st March, 2015. It would become enforceable on 1st April 2015 u/s 17 and the Court/Tribunal would become \"FUNCTUS OFFICIO\". Therefore, if the aggrieved party receives the copy of the ex parte award, say on 20th March, 2015, the thirty days for filing an application for recalling/vacating the ex parte award would be rendered untenable if filed on or after 1st April, 2015 since the Court/Tribunal would have become \"FUNCTUS OFFICIO\" from 1st April, 2015.\n\n\tWhen it comes to the harmonious interpretation of Rule 26 of the Rules vis a vis Section 17 and 17A of the Industrial Disputes Act, the provisions of the Act have to prevail.\n\n(1981) I LLJ 327 (SC), 2005(5) ALL MR 344 (S.C.)

(1908), O.11, R.14\n\nThe member of Industrial Court is in position to direct the party concerned to produce the relevant document and the discretion is, no doubt, left with the Member. It is the subjective satisfaction of the member himself on the basis of which he may or he may not direct the party concerned to produce the documents. However, if this power which is rightly exercised by the Member of the Industrial Court exercising the jurisdiction vested in him in a judicious manner, then High Court cannot accept the argument of the petitioners that their request for production of document has been arbitrarily rejected by the Member of Industrial Court. It is also to be seen that, no doubt, in accordance with the provision of Order XI of the Civil Procedure Code, such an application for production of document can be made even at the stage of interim application. It is also undisputed and it is always not necessary that the application for production of documents must be made along with the original suit or complaint itself. However, that does not mean that merely because application of such a nature is made that the Court must grant it. If the Court is satisfied that production of those documents at that particular stage is not necessary or was not necessary and if due reasoning is given by the Member for that purpose, then in that case, the order cannot be termed to be either arbitrary or resulting into miscarriage of justice.  [Para 12,14,17]\n\nEven otherwise, the matter can be looked at from another angle in accordance with the provisions of Clause 100(2) of the Industrial Courts Regulations, 1975, it is for the complainant to point out regarding each unfair labour practice complained of in a concise statement of the material facts constituting it including that of the date of such occurrence.  [Para 15]\n\nIn the instant case the application does not make out as to exactly for what purposes that those documents are being asked for. In such circumstances, if the apprehension entertained by the other side that the method is adopted just to extend the advantage of the interim order cannot be said to be absolutely wrong. In any case, this High Court does not assist the petitioners to make a roving or fishing enquiry so as to enable themselves to find out some evidence in support of their contentions in respect of interim applications.

As Section 12 provides that a notice of an application from a union for recognition under section 11 is to be displayed on the notice board of the undertaking. The employees concerned are also entitled to show cause as to why the recognition should not be granted to the applicant-union. Regulation 85 also requires the employer whose employee-union has applied for recognition to display on the notice board at a conspicuous place of the premises of the undertaking, such an notice. He further submitted that it would be impossible for the field workers to see the notice if they do not attend the premises of the undertaking itself. However, it is not necessary that a field worker would not ever attend the undertaking, secondly, it is always possible for a field worker to come to know of the same through others. Thirdly, in any event, this would at the highest be a situation which is for the legislature to take care of. The provisions do not militate against interpretation of the provisions of the Act that the Act does not exclude.           [Para 28,29]"

Admittedly, the defaults in the present case range only for 3 days to around maximum of 20 days for the entire period from September, 1978 to February, 1990.  It is also an admitted fact that the actual excise duty has been paid and the respondent has received the same without imposition of any penalty even though there was delay of few days.  Obviously, the respondent has waived such delay and has accepted the payment.  It is not open for the respondent after accepting such a payment, to purportedly raise a claim after a long period of 12 years i.e. from September, 1978 to February, 1990 for the penalty amount.  At the highest, the breach is only technical as there has been delay of a very insignificant number of days.  We find that the order passed by the Authority is totally without application of mind.

Accordingly, payment of interest follows as a matter of course when a money decree is passed. The only question to be decided is since when is such interest payable on such a decree. Though, there are two divergent views, one indicating that interest is payable from the date when claim for the principal sum is made, namely, the date of institution of the proceedings till the recovery of the amount, the other view is that such interest is payable only when a determination is made and order is passed for recovery of the dues. However, the more consistent view has been the former and in rare cases interest has been awarded for periods even prior to the institution of proceedings for recovery of the dues, where the same is provided for by the terms of the agreement entered into between the parties or where the same is permissible by statute. Accordingly, Court is unable to sustain the order of the Railway Claims Tribunal directing payment of interest on default of the payment of the principal sum within a period of 45 days. When there is no specific provision for grant of interest on any amount due, the Court and even Tribunals have been held to be entitled to award interest in their discretion, under the provisions of Section 3 of the Interest Act and Section 34 of the Civil Procedure Code.  1999(3) SCC 257 - Ref. to.

                "description": "Contract for construction of undersea pipe lines - Unconditional Bank guarantee furnished - Bank guarantee invoked for delay in completing work - Plaintiff is entitled to interest on debt due. Civil P.C. (1908), O.37, R.3.\n\nSection 3 of the Interest Act, 1978 confers power upon the Court to allow interest. The power of the Court is to allow interest not at a rate exceeding the current rate of interest, in any proceedings for the recovery of any debt or damages or in any proceedings in which a claim for interest in respect of any debt or damages already paid is made. The expression, \"current rate of interest\" is defined in Section 2(b) as being the highest of the maximum rates at which interest may be paid on different classes of deposits by different classes of scheduled banks in accordance with the directions given or issued to banking companies generally by the Reserve Bank of India under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949. The power of the Court to allow interest under Section 3 arises inter alia, in proceedings for the recovery of any debt. If the proceedings relate to a debt payable by virtue of a written instrument at a certain time, then the Court is empowered to award interest from the date when the debt is payable to the date of the institution of the proceedings. If the proceedings do not relate to any such debt, then the power to allow interest is from a date mentioned in the written notice of demand until the institution of proceedings. In the case of an unconditional and irrevocable Bank Guarantee, the issuing bank undertakes an explicit obligation towards the beneficiary of the Guarantee to pay on demand, a claim lodged by the beneficiary upon the Bank. The obligation assumed by the Bank is absolute and a claim which has been lodged by the beneficiary in terms of the provisions of the Guarantee has to be met by payment by the issuing Bank. The law has now been well settled that the person or body at whose behest the issuing Bank has issued the Bank Guarantee, is not entitled to an order of injunction save and except in the case of established fraud or where the payment of the Guarantee would cause irretrievable injustice or in a case where there are special equities. Again, the nature of the circumstances that must exist in order to establish a case of irretrievable injustice or special equities has been carefully circumscribed in decided cases.  The Judgments of the Supreme Court on the subject emphasise the importance of banks honouring their obligations under unconditional Bank Guarantee since the very fabric of trade and commerce depends upon the fulfillment of the assurance held out in such guarantees that the issuing Bank will honour its obligations. The Bank Guarantee is a contract exclusively between the issuing Bank and the beneficiary. The issuing Bank is not concerned with an underlying contractual dispute that may arise between the beneficiary and the contracting party at whose behest the Bank had issued the Guarantee. The Bank is under an absolute obligation to pay under the guarantee upon a demand being lodged in terms of the Guarantee. In the case of a Bank Guarantee as in the present case, the debt is payable by the Bank by virtue of a written instrument at a certain time, the time being immediately upon invocation of the Bank Guarantee. The Court is, therefore, empowered by the provisions of clause (a) of sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Act to award interest at a rate not exceeding the current rate of interest. [Para 13,14]\n\nSection 3 of the Interest Act, 1978, it must be noted, confers a discretionary power upon the Court to award interest for, the section provides that the Court \"may if it thinks fit allow interest\". In a case such as the present, where the Bank has assumed an unconditional obligation to pay to the Plaintiff who is the beneficiary under the Guarantee, there is a debt due and payable by the Bank upon the invocation of the Bank Guarantee. This debt arises out of a written contract between the issuing Bank, the Defendant in the present case, and the beneficiary who is the Plaintiff. A Summary Suit is clearly maintainable upon the foundation of such a debt. The Court is statutorily vested with the power to award interest in such a case from the date when the debt is payable until the date of the institution of the proceedings. The invocation of the power of the Court to award interest under the provisions of Section 3 of the Interest Act,  1978 does not affect the maintainability of the proceedings. The power, it must be noted, is a power to be exercised by the Court in appropriate cases where the Court considers it appropriate in the exercise of the judicial discretion to award interest.

Such an application would also be maintainable for compound interest for even when the interest is compounded, it still in effect relates to the principal amount. Interest is always qua a principal amount. The component of the principal amount may differ from case to case. For instance where compound interest is payable it will also include the previous interest. It makes no difference. The interest is relatable to and in respect of a right to receive wages or other benefits during the subsistence of the employer-employee relationship to wit during the period the applicant was a workman. Any other view would lead to a totally unjust and undesirable result where the workman would be entitled to maintain an application under Section 33-C(2) only upto the period of his employment, but not thereafter despite the fact that the claim arises in respect of, in relation to or in connection with a period during which he was a workman. It would also lead to an absurd result requiring an employee to file proceedings before the Labour Court for the principal sum and possibly a part of the interest and a civil suit for the interest for the period after he ceased to be a workman. 2004(12) LJSOFT 56 : 2004(III) CLR 870 and 1999(II) LLJ 335 - Ref. to.

(1908), S.34.\n\nAn arbitrator has power to award interest pendente lite and, where the contract is silent as to the awarding of interest, the arbitrator has power to award interest for the pre-reference period if there is a substantive law which empowers him to do so, or if there is a usage of trade for payment which has the force of law. In the instant case, there is no usage of trade. The only substantive law which empowers the arbitrator to award interest is the Interest Act, 1978. It is not in dispute that the arbitration was after coming into force of the 1978 Act i.e. from the year 1981. Thus, the arbitrator had power to award interest in view of Section 3 of the Interest Act, 1978.  [Para 24,25]\n\nA person deprived of the use of money to which he is legitimately entitled has a right to be compensated for the deprivation, call it by any name. It may be called interest, compensation or damages. This basic consideration is as valid for the period the dispute is pending before the arbitrator as it is for the period prior to the arbitrator entering upon the reference. This is the principle of Section 34, Civil Procedure Code and there is no reason or principle to hold otherwise in the case of arbitrator.  [Para 22]\n\nHowever, S.3 of the Interest Act places an embargo upon the power of arbitrator by words \" not exceeding current rate of interest.\"  The maximum rate permitted by R.31 on public deposits during the relevant period was Rs.10%. Therefore, the award of interest in excess of 10% was beyond the power of the arbitrator and could not be sustained.  [Para 26,31]\n\nThus the direction in the award for payment of interest on the entire amount inclusive of interest as made in the award, is perfectly justified both in principle and on precedent.

In reply to the show cause notice issued by the Licensing Authority, the petitioners admitted that the misbranded insecticides have been received by them and have been kept in their shops for sale.  Their licences were suspended on that basis without affording them opportunity of hearing.  They were also prosecuted criminally, but the Criminal Courts, after trial, found on facts that the prosecution has failed to prove that the insecticides which were found in possession of the petitioners, were misbranded.  The acquittal of the accused persons in criminal cases, have certainly bearing on the orders passed by the authorities suspending the licences of the petitioners.\n\nHeld, that even the admissions made by the petitioners in their replies to show cause notice, did not absolve the authorities to get established that the seized articles were, in fact, misbranded insecticides.  More so when the criminal Courts have not accepted the report of the analysis for the reasons stated in the judgments and particularly because the required procedure was not followed.  The fact remains that before the authorities, there was no tangible material to hold that the insecticides seized were, in fact, misbranded.  Thus the orders suspending the licences of the petitioners, are obviously erroneous and cannot sustain in the eyes of law.  The orders suspending licence came to be passed without application of mind.  No reasons are assigned.  What is significant is that it is not even reflected in the orders that the petitioners were heard before passing the orders. [Para 14,19]"

In our opinion the mere intention to adduce evidence in controversion of the report, implies demand to send the sample to Central Insecticides Laboratory for test and analysis.  \t\t\t\t\t      [Para 11,12]\n\nNo proceeding was pending before any Court, when the accused was served with Insecticide Analyst report, the intention was necessarily required to be conveyed to the Insecticide Inspector, which was so done by the appellant and in this background Insecticide Inspector was obliged to institute complaint forthwith and produce sample and request the court to send the sample for analysis and test to the Central Insecticides Laboratory. Appellant did whatever was possible for it. The moment it is done conclusive evidentiary value of the report gets denuded and the statutory right to get the sample tested and analysed by the Central Insecticides Laboratory gets fructified. Its right has been defeated by not sending the sample for analysis and report to Central Insecticides Laboratory. It may be mentioned herein that shelf life of the insecticides had expired even prior to the filing of the complaint. The position therefore which emerges is that by sheer inaction the shelf life of the sample of insecticides had expired and for that reason no step was possible to be taken for its test and analysis by Central Insecticides Laboratory. Valuable right of the appellant having been defeated, allowing this criminal prosecution against the appellant to continue shall be futile and abuse of the process of Court.   [Para 13]"

                "description": "Criminal P.C. (1973), S.482 - Misbranding of insecticide - Prayer for quashing of proceedings - On ground that Insecticide Inspector sent the sample for analysis without institution of any proceeding - Held, Insecticide Inspector has ample power to send sample for testing or analysis to CIL on his own even before filing of a formal complaint against named accused - Criminal proceedings against accused cannot be quashed.\n\n\tInsecticide Inspector is empowered to take samples of any insecticide and send such samples for analysis to the Insecticide Analyst for testing in the prescribed manner. The manner of dispatch of samples for test or analysis is prescribed in Rule 34. It predicates as to how each sample is required to be sent by registered post or by hand in a sealed packet together with a memorandum set out in Form XII in an outer cover addressed to the Insecticide Analyst. As per sub-section (5) of Section 22, if the Insecticide Inspector decides to take a sample of an insecticide for the purpose of test or analysis, he is obliged to intimate such purpose in writing in the prescribed form to the person from whom he takes it and, in the presence of such person unless he willfully absents himself, he shall then divide the sample into three portions and effectively seal and suitably mark the same and permit such person to add his own seal and mark to all or any of the portions so sealed and marked. After that, the Insecticide Inspector is expected to restore one portion of a sample so divided or one container as the case may be, to the person from whom he takes it and retain the remainder and deal with same in the manner prescribed in sub-section (6) of Section 22. Out of the remainder, one portion or container is required to be sent for Insecticide Analyst Test or Analysis. The second portion is required to be produced before the Court where the proceedings if any are instituted in relation to the said insecticide. As noted earlier, the analysis of the sample can be obtained from either the Insecticide Analyst appointed under Section 19 or the CIL established under Section 16 of the Act.\t [Para 11]\n\n\tOn a bare reading of sub-section (3) of S.24, it is seen that the first part declares that the report signed by the Insecticide Analyst shall be evidence of the facts stated therein and it shall be conclusive, unless the \"person from whom\" the sample was taken exercises his right by notifying in writing within the specified time that he intends to adduce evidence in controversion of that report. Thus, the second part of this provision gives a right to the person from whom the sample was collected to raise an objection. Once the person from whom the sample was taken exercises that right in terms of sub-section (4), the conclusiveness of the report of the Insecticide Analyst (State Analyst) referred to in the first part of the same provision cannot be used against such person. These provisions are in the nature of rules of evidence. Further, if the criminal complaint is launched and the person is named as an accused, he can request the concerned Magistrate before whom the proceedings are pending to send the third sample produced before the Court to the CIL for testing or analysis. That right can be exercised only if the complaint is founded on the report of the State Insecticide Analyst. However, if the complaint is filed also on the basis of the report of the CIL, then the question of exercising the right under Section 24 (4) does not endure to the accused. For, the purport of Section 24(4) is that the report of the CIL shall be conclusive evidence of the facts stated therein. It is pertinent to bear in mind that the opening part of sub-section (4) of Section 24 opens with the words, \"Unless the sample has already been tested or analysed in the CIL\". Therefore, in cases where such report is already obtained or available, the criminal prosecution must proceed on that basis. In other words, only if the analysis report of the CIL is not available or filed along with complaint or placed on record in the criminal prosecution, would the accused get a right to request the concerned Magistrate to direct testing or analysis of the third sample produced before that Court by the prosecution from the CIL and not otherwise. Any other view would entail in rewriting of the provisions, which are otherwise plain and unambiguous. Thus, if the report of the CIL has been obtained before filing of the complaint or pursuant to the direction given by the concerned Magistrate and made part of record of the criminal prosecution, as in this case, the accused named in the complaint cannot ask for analysis of the sample already used at the instance of the person from whom it was taken and is named as co-accused. The provisions of the Act predicate that the Insecticide Inspector has ample power to send the sample for testing or analysis to the CIL on his own. Rather, it is his duty to do so if such an express request is made by the person from whom the sample was taken.\t [Para 13,14]"

The right to practice is restricted in the sense that only if the name finds place in the Central Register then the question of practicising in any part of the country arise. The conditions under Section 23 of the Central Act are cumulative. Since the appellants undisputedly do not possess recognised medical qualifications as defined in Section 2(1)(h) their names cannot be included in the Central Register. As a consequence, they cannot practice in any part of India in terms of Section 29 because of non inclusion of their names in the Central Register. Section 17(3A) of the Maharashtra Act refers to Section 23 of the Central Act relating to Central Register. Section 17(1) relates to the register for the State. In any event, it is for the State to see that there is need for having qualification in terms of Second and Fourth Schedule. The claim of the appellants is that they have a right to practice in any part of the country. In terms of Article 19(6) of the Constitution, reasonable restriction can always be put on the exercise of right under Article 19(g).  1992(3) SCC 147, 2007(10) SCC 306, 1997(11) SCC 687 - Ref.

This concept of equality has to be patently infringed by a provision before that provision or any part thereof, can be declared as unconstitutional. The mere fact that there is some inconvenience arising from the language of a provision and its due implementation, cannot be a ground for declaring a provision violative of fundamental rights. The impugned part of Section 7 of the Act is intended to ensure that there is no vacuum in the membership of the Central Council. The legislative intent is clear that there cannot be a vacuum in the working of a statutory body and it cannot be rendered non-existent even for a short period by lapse of membership term or otherwise. Thus, to provide a safeguard for the interregnum period, of the earlier members of the Central Council vacating their office and newly elected members assuming their office, the provisions of Section 7 have been enacted by the Legislature.  [Para 7]\n\nThe presumption of constitutionality is always in favour of a legislation, unless the contrary is shown. Furthermore, a Legislature, in enacting a law, operates on a presumption, in law and practice, both, that all other forums and entities constituted under one or other Act would, in their functioning, act in accordance with law and expeditiously.\n\nIn dealing with the issues of constitutionality, the courts are slow to embark upon an unnecessary, wide or general enquiry and should confine their decision as far as may be reasonably practicable, within the narrow limits required on the facts of a case. Question of constitutionality of a provision is a matter which the courts would venture to examine only for valid, proper and sustainable grounds. The provisions of Section 7 of the Act, or any part thereof, do not suffer from any legal infirmity, excessive legislative power or violate any legal right of any person, including the petitioner, much less a constitutional right. Keeping the principle of strict necessity in mind, the courts do not venture to examine the constitutional validity of a provision and even strike down such provisions, if they are constitutional and a Court does so only if the situation created by such legislation is irremediable or unredeemable. None of these circumstances exist in the present case.  [Para 8,11]"

For whatever reason, once recourse to this exceptional situation becomes necessary, then the concept of reasonable time would come into play. It is a settled rule of statutory interpretation that wherever no specific time limit is prescribed, the concept of reasonable time shall hold the field for completing such an action. The courts in the process of interpretation can supply the lacuna, which would help to achieve the object of the Act and the legislative intent and make the provisions effective and operative.\n\nNeither the Government, nor the Central Council can abjure their obligation to complete the election process within five years, or in any case, within a reasonable time thereafter. Thus, a period of three months would be more than sufficient for completing the election process in accordance with law.

The section also stipulates that the scheme cannot be disapproved by the Central Government without giving a reasonable opportunity of being heard to the medical college concerned. The scheme of Section 13-A therefore, envisages that an institution may be permitted to establish and commence a medical college, provided it has the previous permission of the Central Government. Any such medical college is expected to submit its scheme to the Central Government which then refers the scheme to the CCIM for its recommendations. On receipt of the scheme from the Central Government, the CCIM may obtain such particulars as are necessary from the institution or college concerned in the event the scheme is found to be defective. A reasonable opportunity must be afforded to the institution or medical college for making a representation. Thereafter, the institution/medical college may rectify the defects, if any, specified by the CCIM. Once the scheme is considered by the CCIM and the deficiencies are removed, a report is to be submitted by the CCIM to the Central Government alongwith its recommendations within a period of 6 months from the date of the receipt of the reference from the Central Government. The Central Government is not expected, under Section 13-A of the Act, to send its own team to assess for itself whether the institution/college complies with the requirements. That task is to be performed by the CCIM and the Central Government can only approve or disapprove such scheme. The question of sending their own team for assessing whether a particular institution or college has the infrastructure as required under Section 13-A of the Act,does not arise. While accepting or rejecting the recommendations of the CCIM, the Central Government must consider the factors enumerated in sub-section 8. It is only when these conditions, which are mentioned in sub-section 8 are fulfilled that, the recommendations issued by the CCIM may be accepted by the Central Government. As already stated, there is no provision at all for the Central Government, to send its own team. In fact it is for this reason that one of the panel members of the team, which visited the petitioners to assess the infrastructure, was from the panel of experts nominated by the Central Government. Therefore, the procedure adopted by the Central Government in sending its own team, is not in consonance with the provisions of the Act.  (1995)4 SCC 104 - Ref. to.  [Para 8]"

If within one year from the date of submission of scheme to Central Government under sub-section [2], the steps as set out in sub-sections [3] and [4] are not taken by the Central Government, and no order is communicated by it, then the scheme as forwarded and submitted is, deemed to have been approved. Then what happens is the permission of the Central Government under sub-section [1] shall also be deemed to have been granted. The question of deeming provision will come into play only if the conditions prescribed by sub-section [6] are satisfied and not otherwise.

The reason for this is that it is very difficult to find a good faculty of academicians for doing the job of teachers. In any discipline and especially in a discipline in an institute like I.I.T., it is very difficult to replace an experienced teacher with years of learning, maturity and experience. This explains why in many cases even teachers are retained beyond their extended period of retirement by way of extension or their services are continued on the basis of re-employment. This is done to preserve the intrinsic value and quality of teaching imparted in these institutions.   [Para 32]"

If the Petitioner suffers cancellation of her admission due to this mess created by the college, casually proceeding to admit the Petitioner without compliance of the binding orders from the Central Council and the University concerned as to eligibility of a student for admission, then the remedy of the Petitioner is to claim appropriate compensation from the College as may be open to her but at the same time merits and prescribed standards of medical education can not be sacrificed in the larger public interest by merely protecting the individual interest of the Petitioner. Petitioner does not have any legal right to claim that her admission must be regularized in this case not-with-standing the wrong committed by the college to admit her contrary to the Regulations prevalent and which were in force at the time of her admission. The doctrine of promissory estoppel cannot be invoked in case the authority concerned acted against the Statute as no one can be compelled to act in a manner which is contrary to law. In the facts and circumstances of the present case it is clearly seen that the Brochure mentioned in clause 4.18 that admission to Health Science courses is subject to the grant of eligibility by Maharashtra University of Health Science, Nashik.

It is a half size hypothetical photograph, black and white dotted. Only half of the left arm of the woman is visible. As such, there is no exposure of her breasts and genitalia. The picture has been printed for advertisement of the above oil and capsule showing them to be useful to strengthen nerves and to remove weakness. The entire scenario along with the circumstances around it would suggest that for promoting the sale of the aforesaid products through various medical shops at different places, such an advertisement was published along with the above hypothetical dotted form picture. In view of the changed scenario of the society where the sexual literacy is also a part of modern human life, such depictions does not carry much weight to classify them to be indecent or derogatory to or denigrating the women or likely to deprave, corrupt or injure the public morality of morals. That is more so, because the present depiction will fall in simple category among what has already been available to the society at large through the print and electronic media is much more higher than what has been depicted in the case in hand along with the overall surrounding circumstances.\t\t [Para 14,15]"

Equally, the word circulation or circulate must be given its ordinary and common sense meaning. In the context in which all these words appear it is clear that depiction in any manner of the figure of a woman, her body or form or any part thereof is what is prohibited. Additionally, prohibition of advertisements and publication or sending by post is envisaged. Therefore, it is not as if the offence is prima facie committed only if the distribution to public is made. Therefore, it is not as if the petitioner has committed no offence within the meaning of the Act because the painting or the figure has been depicted on the walls of one bedroom in a house. Once, that bedroom is allegedly accessible not only to the respondent No.1 but a driver and male servants and even to visitors coming to visit the house of the petitioner, then, all the more, the allegations point towards the commission of the offence. Prima facie the act is covered by section 4 and punishable by section 6 of the said Act.\n\nAIR 1979 SC 888, 2007 ALL SCR (O.C.C.) 178, AIR 1986 SC 967 Ref. to. \t     [Para 31]"

(1973), S.482 - Constitution of India, Arts.19, 21 - Freedom of speech and expression - View of a well known actress about pre-marital sex and live-in-relation in an interview to news magazine - Complaints against - Held, it is not task of criminal law to punish individual merely for expressing unpopular views - The law should not be used in a manner that has chilling effects on the 'freedom of speech and expression'.\n\nThe institution of the numerous criminal complaints against the appellant was done in a mala fide manner. In order to prevent the abuse of the criminal law machinery, Court is therefore inclined to grant the relief sought by the appellant. In such cases, the proper course for Magistrates is to use their statutory powers to direct an investigation into the allegations before taking cognizance of the offences alleged. It is not the task of the criminal law to punish individuals merely for expressing unpopular views. The threshold for placing reasonable restrictions on the 'freedom of speech and expression' is indeed a very high one and there should be a presumption in favour of the accused in such cases. It is only when the complainants produce materials that support a prima facie case for a statutory offence that Magistrates can proceed to take cognizance of the same. Initiation of a criminal trial is a process which carries an implicit degree of coercion and it should not be triggered by false and frivolous complaints, amounting to harassment and humiliation to the accused. Even though the constitutional freedom of speech and expression is not absolute and can be subjected to reasonable restrictions on grounds such as 'decency and morality' among others, we must lay stress on the need to tolerate unpopular views in the socio-cultural space. The framers of our Constitution recognised the importance of safeguarding this right since the free flow of opinions and ideas is essential to sustain the collective life of the citizenry. While an informed citizenry is a pre-condition for meaningful governance in the political sense, we must also promote a culture of open dialogue when it comes to societal attitudes. Admittedly, the appellant's remarks did provoke a controversy since the acceptance of pre-marital sex and live-in relationships is viewed by some as an attack on the centrality of marriage. While there can be no doubt that in India, marriage is an important social institution, we must also keep our minds open to the fact that there are certain individuals or groups who do not hold the same view. To be sure, there are some indigenous groups within our country wherein sexual relations outside the marital setting are accepted as a normal occurrence. Even in the societal mainstream, there are a significant number of people who see nothing wrong in engaging in pre-marital sex. Notions of social morality are inherently subjective and the criminal law cannot be used as a means to unduly interfere with the domain of personal autonomy. Morality and Criminality are not co-extensive. In the present case, the substance of the controversy does not really touch on whether pre-marital sex is socially acceptable. Instead, the real issue of concern is the disproportionate response to the appellant's remarks. If the complainants vehemently disagreed with the appellant's views, then they should have contested her views through the news media or any other public platform. The law should not be used in a manner that has chilling effects on the 'freedom of speech and expression'. (1989)2 SCC 574 - Rel. on.  [Para 28,29]"

In Roth v. United States 354 U.S. 476 (1957), noticing that sex and obscenity were held not to be synonymous with each other, the Supreme Court of U.S. held that only those sex-related materials which had the tendency of \"exciting lustful thoughts\" were found to be obscene and the same has to be judged from the point of view of an average person by applying contemporary community standards.\n\nTherefore, Hicklin test is not the correct test to be applied to determine \"what is obscenity\". Section 292 of the Indian Penal Code, of course, uses the expression 'lascivious and prurient interests' or its effect. Later, it has also been indicated in the said Section of the applicability of the effect and the necessity of taking the items as a whole and on that foundation where such items would tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all the relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it. We have, therefore, to apply the \"community standard test\" rather than \"Hicklin test\" to determine what is \"obscenity\". A bare reading of Sub-section (1) of Section 292 , makes clear that a picture or article shall be deemed to be obscene (i) if it is lascivious; (ii) it appeals to the prurient interest, and (iii) it tends to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely to read, see or hear the matter, alleged to be obscene. Once the matter is found to be obscene, the question may arise as to whether the impugned matter falls within any of the exceptions contained in Section. A picture of a nude/seminude woman, as such, cannot per se be called obscene unless it has the tendency to arouse feeling or revealing an overt sexual desire. The picture should be suggestive of deprave mind and designed to excite sexual passion in persons who are likely to see it, which will depend on the particular posture and the background in which the nude/semi-nude woman is depicted. Only those sex-related materials which have a tendency of \"exciting lustful thoughts\" can be held to be obscene, but the obscenity has to be judged from the point of view of an average person, by applying contemporary community standards.
