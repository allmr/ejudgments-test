Going by the definitions in the Act, both Governments could be \"service providers\". The Central Government could also be the licensor. Thus, either as a licensor or a service provider, the Central Government could make an application to TDSAT seeking an adjudication of any dispute between it and the licensee or between it and another service provider or between it and a group of consumers. It has actually to make its claim in TDSAT. There is no reason to whittle down the right given to the Central Government to approach the TDSAT for an adjudication of its claim which comes under Section 14(1) of the Act. Normally, a right to make a claim would also include a right to make a cross-claim or counter claim in the sense that the Central Government could always make an independent claim on matters covered under the Act and such a claim will have to be entertained by the TDSAT. This the Central Government could do even while it is defending a claim made against it in TDSAT, by way of a separate application. If a subject matter is capable of being raised before the TDSAT by the Central Government or the State Government by way of a claim by making an application under Section 14 of the Act, it would not be logical to hold that the same claim could not be made by way of a counter claim when the other side, namely, the licensee or consumers, had already approached the TDSAT with a claim of their own and the Central Government is called upon to defend it. It is, therefore, not possible to accept an argument that a counter claim by the Central Government or State Government cannot be entertained by the TDSAT. Held, the TDSAT has jurisdiction to entertain a counter claim in the light of Section 14(1) and 14-A of the Act.  [Para 12]"

The Plaintiff has made out a dispute as a licencee of the Defendant under the licence dated 22nd January, 1999. The Plaintiff's dispute is with regard to the preponement of monopolisation under the licence. The Plaintiff's dispute is also with regard to the extent and content of the package offered by the Government in consideration of such preponement which the Plaintiff claims is insufficient compensation for the loss suffered by the Plaintiff upon having acted pursuant to the promise by the Defendant. The case of the promissory estoppel made out by the Plaintiff is sought to be compensated by additional compensation claimed in addition to the package offered by the Government. It would have to be seen whether the Defendant was without its rights to have modified licence of the Plaintiff by preponement of its monopolisation under the package and whether such modification was in the interest of general public or for the proper conduct of telegraphs. The Court adjudicating upon such a dispute would require to bear in mind the worldwide technical advances in the field of telecommunications as well as the economic development of India in that regard to determine how much, if at all, the package to be given by the Government would be required to be enhanced or compensation of a particular extent be awarded to the Plaintiff.  [Para 18]\n\nIt may be mentioned that the arbitration clause in the terms and conditions of the licence agreement can also be invoked by the parties so as to have their dispute decided by a skilled adjudicator who would take into consideration the causes and effects of the policy of the Defendant resulting in preponement of the monopolisation of the Plaintiff. It may also be mentioned that the rejection of the package offered by the Defendant as insufficient compensation by the Plaintiff itself requires creation of further options in the interest of both the parties to mitigate the loss, if any, by the demonopolisation of the Plaintiff which can be achieved best by the mode of mediation. This itself shows and suggests that the dispute between the parties if adjudicated upon would require its adjudication by a specialised tribunal which will be better equipped to handle various aspects for considering the adequacy or otherwise of the additional compensation claimed by the Plaintiff. It is for such cases that the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts is expressly barred under Sections 15 and 27 of the Telecom Act. 2007 ALL SCR 2834 - Ref. to.  [Para 23]"

An elaborate procedure is prescribed for registration of a hospital. Unless such registration for a hospital is secured a surgical operation of transplantation of human organs there is not permissible. The Act and the Rules however do not provide individual surgeons who would undertake the surgical operations, are required to be specifically authorized by the appropriate authority. The Rules of (1995) do not prohibit an expert who is member of a team of experts of a registered hospital, from performing transplantation operation in any other registered hospital. At the same time in view of the rules referred to above an expert who is not member of a team of any registered hospital, no matter, how much experience he has in this field, is not permitted to perform transplantation operation in any registered hospital.  [Para 7,10,11]\n\nThe position that emerges is that if an expert in this field as defined under rule 9-C is recognized as member of team of experts in a registered hospital, he would be able to perform surgical operations involving transplantation of kidney in any other registered hospital. The registered hospital has to ascertain as to whether such expert is a member of a team of experts in any other registered hospital. On ascertainment of this information, a registered hospital is able to permit such expert who is not member of their own team to perform transplantation operations in their hospital. The appropriate authority can not raise any objection to this practice.  [Para 11]"

The Authorisation Committee is, therefore, required to satisfy that the real purpose of the donor authorizing removal of the organ is by reason of affection or attachment towards the recipient or for any other special reason. Such special reasons can by no stretch of imagination encompass commercial elements. Above being the intent, the inevitable conclusion is that the Authorisation Committees of the State to which the donor and the donee belong have to take the exercise to find out whether approval is to be accorded. Such Committee shall be in a better position to ascertain the true intent and the purpose for the authorisation to remove the organ and whether any commercial element is involved or not. They would be in a better position to lift the veil of projected affection or attachment and the so-called special reasons and focus on the true intent. The burden is on the applicants to establish the real intent by placing relevant materials for consideration of the Authorisation Committee. Whether there exists any affection or attachment or special reason is within the special knowledge of the applicants, and a heavy burden lies on them to establish it. Several relevant factors like relationship if any (need not be near relationship for which different considerations have been provided for), period of acquaintance, degree of association, reciprocity of feelings, gratitude and similar human factors and bounds can throw light on the issue. It is always open to the Authorisation Committee considering the application to seek information/materials from Authorisation Committees of other States/State Governments, as the case may be, for effective decision in the matter. In case any State is not covered by the operation of the Act or the Rules, the operative executive instructions/Government orders will hold the field. As the object is to find out the true intent behind the donor's willingness to donate the organ, it would not be in line with the legislative intent to require the Authorisation Committee of the State where the recipient is undergoing medical treatment to decide the issue whether approval is to be accorded. \t [Para 12]"

It would be appropriate for the Legislature to accordingly amend the Rules and the Form I, so that requirement for disclosing incomes and vocations for some previous financial years (say 3 years) gets statutorily incorporated. This would help the Authorisation Committees to assess whether any commercial dealing is involved or not.

Act is thus mitigated to some extent by S.149.\n\nSection 149 of Civil P.C. does not deal only with court fees payable on a plaint. The said Section also deals with every document with respect to which court fee is required to be paid under the appropriate law. It may be further mentioned that Order VIII of the Code provides for set-off and counter claims under Rule 6 and 6A. Under Section 8 of the Tamil Nadu Act, it is declared that  \"a written statement pleading a set-off or counter claim shall be chargeable with fee in the same manner as a plaint\". Therefore, when Section 149 of the Code speaks about a document with respect to which court fee is required to be paid, it takes within its sweep not only plaints but various other documents with respect to which court fee is required to be paid under the appropriate law including written statements in a suit.  [Para 27]\n\nThe question whether there is a deficit of court fee paid with respect to a plaint depends on two factors: (1) the valuation of the suit, and (2) the determination of the appropriate court fee payable thereupon. There can occur an error (either advertently or otherwise), on either of the abovementioned counts. Under Section 12(1) of the Tamil Nadu Act, primarily it is the obligation of the Court to examine all the relevant material and determine whether the proper fee payable on the plaint is paid or not. Under Section 12(2) of the Tamil Nadu Act, the defendant can also raise objections to either the valuation of the suit or the determination of the court fee payable. The determination of the accuracy of the valuation of the suit and/or the appropriate court fee payable thereon, in either of the contingencies mentioned above, is required to be made by the Court. If the Court reaches the conclusion that the appropriate court fee is not paid, the consequences stipulated in Section 12(2) to (4) should follow.  [Para 32]"

                "description": "Registration of assignments and transmissions - Grant of registration, cannot be said to be a mere formality - Non-registration of assignment will have to be considered as an important factor while deciding the question as to whether the plaintiff is entitled to the relief of temporary injunction during pendency of suit - S.44 does not create a bar for filing a suit by the assignee whose application is pending disposal for registration.\n\nCivil P.C. (1908), O.39, R.1.\n\nSection 44 does not create a bar for filing a suit by the assignee whose application is pending disposal for registration.  A discretion, however, is vested in the Court under sub-clause (2) of Section 44 of the Act, whether to permit the said unregistered document in evidence or not. At the same time, it cannot be said that the procedure of registration of assignment is a mere formality.  It appears from the various provisions that the legislature has thought it fit to scrutinise every application for assignment and transmission keeping in view the various other Acts, including the import restrictions, foreign exchange, etc., as also any inter se disputes between the assignor and assignee and only thereafter, if the Registrar is satisfied the said application for assignment would be registered. Therefore, the view taken by the Madras High Court in the case of T. I. Muhammad Zummon Sahib (supra) that the registration is a mere formality cannot be accepted.  In any case, in the said judgment, the question which fell for consideration before the Court was regarding the transmission of registration and in the said case the transmission had acquired finality by virtue of personal law prevailing at that time in respect of the plaintiff.  Lastly, during the pendency of the suit before the judgment was delivered, registration of transmission was already granted in favour of the plaintiff. Therefore, the said judgment will not be of any assistance to the appellant.  However, in the subsequent judgment in the matter of Belighty Industries Association, Court has held that the right to sue an unregistered proprietor is not in terms excluded but is affected by section 11 of the Act of 1919.  In the present case also, therefore, though the plaintiff is an unregistered assignee, it cannot be said that he is prevented from filing a suit during the pendency of the registration; for sub-clause (2) of the same Section clearly vests discretion with the Court either to admit the same in evidence or to reject the admissibility of the same in evidence.  The trial court, therefore, erred in holding that the document of assignment cannot be admitted in evidence as a proof of title to the trade marks. In view of sub-clause (2), the discretion is vested in the Court to examine as to whether it is admissible or not.  However, the registration of a Deed of Assignment would be one of the important factors which would have to be taken into consideration by the Court while deciding the question of grant of temporary injunction.  Section 44 has been incorporated merely as a safeguard by the legislature in order to avoid the multiplicity of the proceedings and also in order to ensure that the various other laws prevailing in the country are safeguarded while registering the assignment.  Thus, the grant of registration of assignment or transmission cannot be said to be a mere formality and on a conjoint reading of the provisions it will be apparent that the Registrar has to be satisfied after going through the application, which has to be filed in the prescribed form giving various particulars.  In the present case, non registration of the assignment will have to be considered as an important factor while deciding the question as to whether the plaintiff is entitled to the relief of temporary injunction during the pendency of the suit.

It has mandated that no information about the commission of an offence under TADA shall be recorded by the police without the prior approval of the District Superintendent of Police. Not only this, further safeguard has been provided and restriction has been put on the court not to take cognizance of any offence without the previous sanction of the Inspector-General of Police or as the case may be, the Commissioner of Police. Both operate in different and distinct stages and, therefore, for successful prosecution both the requirements have to be complied with.

It is relevant here to state that the Designated Court, besides trying the case under TADA, can also try any other offence with which the accused may be charged at the same trial if the offence is connected with the offence under TADA. When the Designated Court had the power to try offences under TADA as well as other offences, it is implicit that it has the power to convict also and that conviction is permissible to be ordered under TADA or other penal laws or both.\n\nThe conviction of the accused to have been vitiated on account of non-compliance of Section 20-A(1) of TADA and thus, it may be permissible in law to maintain the conviction under the Arms Act and the Explosive Substances Act but that shall only be possible when there are legally admissible evidence to establish those charges. The Designated Court has only relied on the confessions recorded under TADA to convict the accused for offences under the Arms Act and the Explosive Substances Act. In view of finding that their conviction is vitiated on account of non-compliance of the mandatory requirement of prior approval under Section 20-A(1) of TADA, the confessions recorded cannot be looked into to establish the guilt under the aforesaid Acts. Hence, the conviction of the accused under Section 7 and 25(1A) of the Arms Act and Section 4, 5 and 6 of the Explosive Substances Act cannot also be allowed to stand. [Para 38,40]"

The lawyers, straight after their enrolment, who join the legal profession with high hopes and expectations and dedicate their whole lives to the professions, are the real deservers. Lawyers who enroll themselves after their retirement from government services and continue to receive pension and other terminal benefits, who basically join this field in search of greener pastures in the evening of their lives cannot and should not be equated with those who have devoted their whole lives to the profession. For these retired persons, some amount of financial stability is ensured in view of the pension and terminal benefits and making them eligible for lump sum welfare fund under the Act would actually amount to double benefits. Therefore, the classification of lawyers into these two categories is a reasonable classification having a nexus with the object of the Act.\n\n Furthermore, it is also to be noted that in view of their being placed differently than the class of lawyers who chose this profession as the sole means of their livelihood, it can reasonably be discerned that the retired persons form a separate class. As the object of the Act is to provide for the constitution of a Welfare Fund for the benefit of advocates on cessation of practice. As per Section 3 (2) (d) of Tamil Nadu Act, any grant made by the Government to the welfare fund is one of the source of the Advocates' Welfare Fund. The retired employees are already in receipt of pension from the Government or other employer and to make them get another retiral benefit from the Advocates' Welfare Fund would amount to double benefit and they are rightly excluded from the benefit of the lump sum amount of welfare fund. \t [Para 28,29]"

A confessional statement recorded by a Police Officer not below the rank of Superintendent of Police under Section 15 of TADA Act is admissible, while it is not so admissible unless made to the Magistrate under Section 25 of the Evidence Act. It appears, consideration of a confessional statement of an accused to a Police Officer except to the extent permitted under Section 27 of the Evidence Act is not permissible. There is one common feature, both in Section 15 of TADA Act and Section 24 of the Evidence Act that the confession has to be voluntary. Section 24 of the Evidence Act interdicts a confession, if it appears to the Court to be the result of any inducement, threat or promise in certain conditions. The principle therein is that confession must be voluntary. Section 15 of TADA Act also requires the confession to be voluntary. Voluntary means that one who makes it out of his own free will inspired by the sound of his own conscience to speak nothing but the truth. The crux of making a statement voluntarily is, what is intentional, intended, unimpelled by other influences, acting on one's own will, through his own conscience. Such confessional statements are made mostly out of a thirst to speak the truth which at a given time predominates in the heart of the confessor which impels him to speak out the truth. Internal compulsion of the conscience to speak out the truth normally emerges when one is in despondency or in a perilous situation when he wants to shed his cloak of guilt and nothing but disclosing the truth would dawn on him. It sometimes becomes so powerful that he is ready to face all consequences for clearing his heart.   [Para 23]\n\nThe question whether a confession is voluntary or not is always a question of fact. A free and voluntary confession is deserving of highest credit, because it is presumed to flow from the highest sense of guilt.   [Para 24]"

                "description": "Constitutional validity - Section 106 as amended by S.2 dispensing with requirement that notice must terminate tenancy at the end of the month of tenancy and S.3 giving it limited retrospectivity - Held, there is nothing arbitrary or ultra vires therein.\n\nParliament and the state legislatures have plenary powers of legislation to legislate upon the fields assigned to them. Subject only to constitutional restrictions Parliament and the legislatures of the States can legislate prospectively or retrospectively. As a rule of construction, a statute which deals with substantive rights is prima facie construed to be prospective unless its operation is retrospective either expressly or by necessary implication. Hence, unless there are words in the statute that would indicate that the intention of the legislature was to affect existing rights a statute enacting a provision of substantive law is construed to be prospective in its operation. In contrast to statutes dealing with what are regarded as substantive matters, statutes governing matters of procedure are presumed to be retrospective unless such a restriction is not textually admissible. However, these are rules of construction and interpretation. These principles of interpretation do not define the limits of constitutional power. The constitutional power extends to enacting legislation both prospective and retrospective.   [Para 12]\n\nThe background in which an amendment to Section 106 came to be enacted find elaboration in the One Hundred and Eighty-First Report of the Law Commission. The requirement of furnishing a notice expiring with the month of tenancy gave rise to a considerable degree of uncertainty in the law. The object of Section 106 was that before a lessor sues for possession, there must be a cessation of the relationship of lessor and lessee. The period of notice was intended to give to the lessee a reasonable period before being called upon to vacate the premises. However, the interpretation of Section 106 was not free from complexity and the line of precedent gave rise to rigidities in the application of law that were perhaps unforeseen by the framers of the legislation in 1882. The date on which the notice was served was required to be excluded as a result of the judicial interpretation of Section 106 though not the day on which the tenancy was sought to be terminated. There were disputes in regard to the exact date of the commencement of tenancy which concomitantly gave rise to a dispute in regard to the expiration of the tenancy. Though in the generality of cases suits came to be instituted much after the stipulated period had expired, yet issues were required to be framed and were framed by trial courts across the country on the validity of notices of termination. Apart from breeding delay, there was a multiplicity of litigation since it was always open to the landlord to institute a fresh suit for eviction upon a due and valid termination of tenancy. This was the state of affairs which Parliament sought to obviate in enacting an amendment to Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. The object of the amendment was to render the law certain and to provide consistency in its application. Certainty and consistency are the ideals - however elusive they may be in practice - for a system governed by the rule of law. The legislature has thus stepped in to correct an obvious deficiency in the law. No litigant can claim to have a vested right in benefiting from the complexities of law or in the confusion that may be generated by ingenious arguments designed to defeat the genuine claim of a plaintiff who sues to recover possession upon the termination of a lease which does not find protection of rent control legislation. Thus the element of public interest must militate against the acceptance of the argument that the amendment is arbitrary or unconstitutional as being in violation of Article 14. Plainly it is not.   [Para 17]\n\nParliament was completely within the realm of its plenary powers in determining that the amended provision should have limited retrospectivity. The retrospectivity that has been conferred is to the extent that the amended provision shall apply to all notices in pursuance of which a suit or proceeding is pending at the commencement of the Amending Act. Similarly, the amending provision applies to notices which have been issued before the commencement of the Act but where no suit or proceeding has been filed before such commencement. The legislature has, therefore, considered it appropriate in its wisdom to extend the application of the amended provision to situations where adjudication has not been concluded on the validity of a notice of termination under Section 106. There is nothing arbitrary or ultra vires therein. [Para 18]"

The former is governed by Army Act 1950 while the latter is governed by the Territorial Army Act 1948. It is implicit in Section 9 of the Territorial Army Act that when the person enrolled in the Territorial Army is not called out during that period of disembodied state, he is not subjected to the provisions of the Army Act. It is thus clear from the statutory scheme that a fine distinction is made between regular army personnel and personnel enrolled in territorial army. Further distinction has to be made between the Territorial Army personnel who are embodied and those who are in disembodied state. It is only when the Territorial Army personnel get embodied, which means that when they are called out or attached to any portion of the regular army for active duty, that the provisions of Army Act 1950 are applied to the Territorial Army personnel. When the Territorial Army personnel are in a disembodied state i.e., when they are not called out or attached to any portion of the regular army for active duty, then the Territorial Army Act 1948 governs the service conditions and this is the statutory scheme. \t [Para 10]"

Mehra were staying together  and there was joint and common use of three telephones provided to the petitioners and the two telephones provided to Mrs. A.V. Mehra.  The argument advanced by the learned counsel for the respondents that in the application form for getting  telephone connection the petitioners as well as Mrs.A.V. Mehra have stated their residential address as 17, Aashiana and, therefore it should be considered that all the three petitioners and Mrs. A.V. Mehra are family members staying jointly can hardly be accepted.  Aashiana is a multi-storeyed building having number of flats wherein petitioners no. 1 and 3 are staying in one flat, petitioner no.2 is staying in another flat and the defaulter subscriber Mrs.A.V.Mehra is staying in yet another flat.  Merely because building address is common, by no stretch of imagination, can it be said that there is joint and common use of the telephones allotted to the petitioners and the telephones allotted to the defaulter subscriber.  In our considered view, the case in hand is squarely covered by the judgment of this Court in Dr.B.V. Manek.  The action of the respondents, therefore, in disconnecting the three telephones provided to petitioners no.1,2 and 3 is wholly illegal, arbitrary and highly unjustified.  We, consequently, allow the writ petition as disconnection of three telephones bearing nos.6045309, 6048503 and 6000686 provided to petitioners no.1, 2 and 3 respectively is wholly illegal.  The respondents 1 to 3 are directed to forthwith restore the three telephone connections bearing nos. 6045309, 6048503 and 6000686 and in no case later than twenty four hours failing which the respondents shall be liable to pay compensation at the rate of Rs.1,000/- per day's delay to the petitioners no.1, 2 and 3.  The respondents 1 to 3 are also directed to pay cost of Rs.1000/- to the petitioners as cost of the writ petition.\t [Para 10,11]"

The Central Government in furtherance to the Rules and Regulations framed had issued certain directions which may be binding on the Committee but it will be so only if such instructions were in consonance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder. Assumption of powers by any authority or forum including the Government and/or the Committee itself cannot be justified in the eyes of law. Defined powers can be exercised only by the authority which is duly empowered to act under the relevant provisions. Assumption of power on the plea that it was in the interest of administration to do so cannot be sustained in law when the exercise of delegated powers is apparently contrary to the specific provision. \n\nWhatever be the circumstances, the law must prevail and every authority in the hierarchy of the Committee should act in accordance with law. The provisions of Section 14 and Rules 33 to 35 clearly command that the Respondents cannot pass the impugned resolution. The resolution is in violation of these Rules and thus cannot be permitted to stand. AIR 1989 SC 1582 - Ref. to.  [Para 19]"

Once these statutory posts are handled by duly appointed persons, then the Secretary of the Committee cannot be termed as head of the department in terms of Rules 34 and 35.

A person who is, by specific language of the provision and even under the scheme of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder is subordinate to another officer then such a subordinate officer cannot be head of the department when that higher officer/official is holding the higher post. There is a definite hierarchy contemplated under the provisions of the Act and executive direction or resolution cannot be passed which will be contrary to the specific provisions of the Act. Once framers of the Rules have vested the Secretary of the Committee with very limited powers under the Rules 35-A to J then the scope of these powers can hardly be extended that too to the extent where it will be in direct contradiction to the specific provisions which prohibits directly or at least by necessary implications delegation of such powers to the Secretary of the Committee. The pure theory of law, according to eminent positivist jurist Kelsen requires that once the principal legislation or statutory rules though may be inferior to the principal act would have precedence over any other regulation or orders issued in exercise of its executive power. Thus, nothing could be done by executive orders or by resolution by the Committee which would offend or being in conflict with the statutory provisions. (2005)10 SCC 244 - Ref. to. [Para 14]"

The views of the next of kin are entitled to deference but this is not to suggest that the Authorization Committee, once a disagreement is expressed, would have no power to take an independent decision based on the best interest of the donor and the donee. Ultimately, the Authorization Committee has to take a judicious decision after considering all the facts and circumstances.\n\nIn the present case, the admitted position is that the donor and the donee are not 'near relatives' as defined in Section 2(i) of the Act. The Authorization Committee took note of the fact that the donor and the donee are cousins. The fact that other relatives of the donor including his brother and his two minor children who have objected to the proposed transplant have not disputed the relationship between the donor and the donee, is a matter of some significance. The Authorization Committee has erred in coming to the conclusion that a bond of love and affection could not be established. The Authorization Committee seems to have formed that view on the basis that : (i) the elder brother and the minor daughters of the donor had opposed the donation of a kidney by the donor to the donee; and (ii) the donee has his own relatives who have not come forward to donate a kidney. The existence of the objections of the relatives of the donor and the fact that other relatives of the donee have not come forward with a proposal for transplantation, would not, displace a case of affection and attachment between the donor and the donee. These circumstances which were borne in mind by the Authorization Committee are relevant to the ultimate decision which the Authorization Committee has to take on whether to grant its approval. The Authorization Committee however, erred in holding that the circumstances on which it relied upon did not establish a bond of love and affection between the donor and the donee. In the circumstances, that it would be necessary for the Authorization Committee to have a fresh look at the entirety of the proposal having regard to the provisions of the Act and the Rules. \t\t\t \t  [Para 11,13,15]"

Thereafter, the said mills were nationalized under the provisions of the Textile Undertakings (Nationalisation) Act, 1995. As per section 3(2), every Textile Undertaking vested in the Union of India immediately stood transferred to and vested in the National Textile Corporation (NTC). Any liability arising in respect of wages and other dues of employees of Kohinoor Mills became the liability of the Union of India and was required to be discharged for and on behalf of the Union of India by NTC. Section 6 empowered NTC to transfer any Textile Undertaking to its subsidiary and in case of such transfer liabilities of NTC are to be discharged by such subsidiary. This is how the National Textile Corporation (Maharashtra North) Ltd. being wholly owned subsidiary of NTC, is liable to pay the dues of the workers of the Kohinoor Mills in view of the provisions of section 5(2) read with section 6 of the said Act of 1995.   [Para 3,10]\n\nThe facts of these Petitions show a very sorry state of affairs. Petitioners, ex-employees of Kohinoor Mills Company Ltd., filed complaints under Maharashtra Recognition of Trade Unions and Prevention of Unfair Labour Practices Act, 1971 for recovery of salary and other relief. Separate Recovery Certificates were issued between January, 2003 and June, 2005 by the Industrial Court in different amounts on the basis of the final orders passed in the complaints. Collector failed to recover amounts in the same manner as arrears of land revenue. Meanwhile property of Kohinoor Mill No.3 was sold for Rs.421 crores by a public auction.  Writ petition filed seeking direction to recover the amounts with interest. High Court observed that instead of taking steps by exercising statutory powers u/s. 267 of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code, 1966, Collector passed an order granting installments in favour of the fifth respondent to pay dues as per recovery certificates.  Apart from the fact that the Collector granted installment without giving an opportunity of being heard to the persons who were holding recovery certificates, the Collector even did not care to ensure that interest is charged as required by section 267 of the Code. The Collector could not have granted installments without giving prior notice nor could have compelled the Petitioners to accept their legitimate dues by installments without giving an opportunity of being heard. Collector has failed to perform his statutory duty u/sec.50 of the said MRTP and PULP Act of recovering amounts under the recovery certificates as arrears of land revenue.  This is not a case where Collector took steps for effecting attachment and only thereafter, the fifth respondent came out with plea of grant of installments. Dues of the workers were towards salary which had remained unpaid for several years.  The Collector and the State Government did not take any steps to ensure immediate recovery of the dues of the workmen. Thus, the second respondent failed to perform his duty. No steps as a welfare State were taken by the first respondent.  Only prompt action on the part of the second respondent was that of grant of installments.  High court directed the National Textile Corporation (Maharashtra North) Ltd. - fifth respondent - to pay to each petitioner in these petitions entire amount due and payable as per recovery certificates issued in their favour, if not paid, and to pay interest at the rate of 6 per cent per annum from the date of issuance of recovery certificate till the date of payment of the entire principal amount payable under the certificates. The interest shall be paid to petitioners within three months.  The respondent Nos.1 and 2 shall together pay costs of Rs.7,500/- to each and every petitioner in these petitions within a period of two months.   [Para 4,14,20,21]"

As a general rule, the trustees must execute duties of their office jointly and the general rule of joint execution of duties is subject to certain exceptions as mentioned in the case of J.P. Srivastava [(2005) 1 SCC 172]. These exceptions indicate that one of the trustees can act singularly or perform duties of the co-trustees in situations where the trust deed allows the trust to be executed by one or more of the trustees or where there is express sanction or approval of the act by the co-trustees or where the delegation of power is necessary or where the beneficiaries competent to contract consent to the delegation or where the delegation to a co-trustee is in regular course of business or where a co-trustee merely gives effect to the decision taken by the trustees jointly.

The provisions of Section 2(20) do not imply that the provisions of Indian Trusts Act, 1882 relating to creation of trust, appointment of trustees, their powers, duties, responsibilities, etc. will apply to the Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950. The provision of Section 2(20) of the Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950, which stipulates that words and expressions used, but not defined in this Act and defined in Indian Trusts Act, 1882 shall have the meanings assigned to them in that Act, is a legislative device generally adopted for the sake of brevity. However, so far as applicability of the provisions of Sections 47 and 48 of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882 to the public trusts is concerned, there is no such legislation evolved by the Legislature in particular or in general and incorporated in the Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950 so that the provisions of the Indian Trusts Act, 1882 can be read in Bombay Public Trusts Act, 1950. On the other hand, the Preamble and provision of Section 1 of Indian Trusts Act, 1882 are otherwise. Even otherwise, the Apex Court in the case of Thayarammal has specifically held that the provisions of Indian Trusts Act, 1882 are not applicable to the public trusts and are applicable to the private trusts only.

                ],
                "description": "Arbitration clause in 'Trust Deed' - Does not constitute arbitration agreement - Because 'Trust Deed' is signed only by settlor of trust and not by beneficiaries - Beneficiaries cannot be regarded as 'party' to such deed - There being no proposal and acceptance, Trust Deed does not partake nature of agreement - Application u/S.11 for appointment of arbitrator in matters of trust, therefore, not maintainable - Also because, such a clause in trust deed has effect of ousting jurisdiction of Civil Court which cannot be readily inferred - Matters relating to trust can only be decided by forums prescribed under Trust Act - This decision has added one more category of non-arbitrable cases as specified in Booz Allen's case 2011(7) ALL MR 786 (S.C.).\n\n\tIn the case of a Will, the testator executes the Will in favour of legatee(s) whereas in the case of a Trust, the settlor executes the deed in favour of the beneficiaries. In both the cases, it is the testator/settlor who signs the document alone. That apart, both the deeds convey the interest in the estate in favour of the legatees or/and beneficiaries. However, since legatee/beneficiaries do not sign the document or not required to sign such document, they are not regarded as party to such deed despite legatee/beneficiaries/trustees accepting the deed. Such deed, therefore, does not partake the nature of an agreement between such parties. In the light of foregoing discussion, it is to be held that the Trust Deed including the arbitration clause does not satisfy the requirements of Section 2(b) and 2(h) read with Section 7 of the Act and hence, the Trust Deed cannot be construed as an \"arbitration agreement\" within the meaning of Section 7 of the Act. \n2010 ALL SCR 682 Rel. on. \t [Para 33,35]\n\n\tThere is always a proposal and then its acceptance in the case of every agreement, which is not required in the case of creation of the Trust because in the case of a Trust, the trustee and beneficiary though accept its creation but by such acceptance, they merely undertake to carry out the terms of the Trust Deed in so far as the same may be in accordance with law. The clause relating to arbitration in the Trust Deed is one of the several clauses. The other clauses which deal with several types of directions to the trustees and beneficiaries such as how the Trust should be managed, how the amount of the Trust should be spent etc. are not in the nature of agreement between the trustees or/and beneficiaries. In other words, by accepting the Trust Deed, it cannot be said that the trustees or beneficiaries have agreed amongst themselves as to how they should spend the money or how they should manage the affairs of the Trust or receive any benefit.\t [Para 42]\n\n\tFurther, the clause in an agreement, which provides for deciding the disputes arising out of such agreement through private arbitration, affects the jurisdiction of the Civil Court and the ouster of jurisdiction of Courts cannot be inferred readily. The Arbitration Act is one such law, which provides for ouster of jurisdiction of the Civil Courts. The Act, inter alia, provides a forum for deciding the disputes inter se parties to an agreement through arbitration. Such clause requires strict rule of interpretation to find out whether it provides an ouster of jurisdiction and, if so, to which Court/Tribunal/Authority as the case may be. In the case at hand, when we apply this principle of interpretation, we do not find that arbitration clause in Trust deed enables the arbitrator to assume the jurisdiction to decide the disputes arising between the beneficiaries. In other words, said clause does not satisfy the rigour of Sections 2(b), 2(h) and 7 of the Act. \t [Para 43]\n\n\tOn examining the Scheme of the Trust Act, found no difficulty in concluding that though the Trust Act do not provide any express bar in relation to applicability of other Acts for deciding the disputes arising under the Trust Act yet, there exists an implied bar of exclusion of applicability of the Arbitration Act for deciding the disputes relating to Trust, trustees and beneficiaries through private arbitration. Since sufficient and adequate remedy is provided under the Trust Act for deciding the disputes in relation to Trust Deed, Trustees and beneficiaries, the remedy provided under the Arbitration Act for deciding such disputes is barred by implication.\t  [Para 58,59]\n\n\t The disputes relating to Trust, trustees and beneficiaries arising out of the Trust Deed and the Trust Act are not capable of being decided by the arbitrator despite existence of arbitration agreement to that effect between the parties. Therefore application filed by the respondents under Section 11 of the Act is not maintainable on the ground that firstly, it is not based on an \"arbitration agreement\" within the meaning of Sections 2(b) and 2(h) read with Section 7 of the Act and secondly, assuming that there exists an arbitration agreement (clause in the Trust Deed) yet the disputes specified therein are not capable of being referred to private arbitration for their adjudication on merits.\t [Para 61]\n\n\tThus one more category of cases can be added, i.e. category (vii), namely, cases arising out of Trust Deed and the Trust Act, in the list of (vi) categories of cases specified by Supreme Court in Para 36 at page 547 of the decision rendered in the case of Booz Allen & Hamilton Inc. (supra) which cannot be decided by the arbitrator(s).\t [Para 62]"

(1908), O.39, R.1 - Scope - Plaintiff, a foreign company - Suit for permanent injunction - Allegation that defendant, an N.R.I. holding responsible position in plaintiff company made secret profits fraudulently and in breach of trust - Deposited that amount in a Bank in India - Cause of action commenced outside India and parties involved residing outside India - Plaintiff obtaining leave under Cl.XII of Letters Patent (Bom.) - Entitled to injunction sought for.\n\nIn instant case, the Plaintiff is a company in corporated in Dubai and the defendant No.1 an Indian national, was one of the promoters of the Plaintiff company and occupied different portions in that company.  The Plaintiff has sought a permanent injunction against the 1st Defendant restraining him from transferring, disposing of, alienating, encumbering, parting with possession of, removing from India or dealing with his assets including the amounts lying to the credit of the accounts held by him with the N.R.I. branch of a Bank, the 2nd defendant and of all other accounts of his with the 2nd Defendant until the hearing and disposal of Suit filed in the English Court by the Plaintiff and until the satisfaction in full of the decree, if any, that may be passed against the 1st Defendant therein.  The Plaintiff has also sought an injunction restraining the 2nd Defendant Bank from permitting the 1st Defendant to operate in any manner or closing the said account and any other account that may be held by the 1st Defendant for the same duration.  The Plaintiff's case is that between 1997 and 1999 it purchased, rather was made to purchase, four items of machinery at a significant over valuation.  Further, payments have been made by the plaintiff for certain goods which were not received by it.  This, it is alleged, was with a view to enable inter-alia the first Defendant to make secret profits fraudulently and in breach of his fiduciary duties to the Plaintiff.  There was no satisfactory explanation from defendant No.1 regarding the money in his account with the defendant No.2 Bank.\n\nHeld, at the material time Defendant No.1 owed fiduciary duties to the Plaintiff.  Also it is found that prima-facie, Defendant No.1 did act in breach of his fiduciary duties. Defendant No.1, having gained for himself the said pecuniary advantage, the Plaintiff is entitled to trace the money to his hands.  He holds the same for the benefit of the Plaintiff under Section 88 of the Trust Act.  [Para 44]\n\nIt could  not be said that it was not possible to identify the money presently lying in the account to be the same as the money that came into the account, as a result of breach of trust committed by the defendant No.1.  Since the defendant No.1 failed to produce the relevant documents in respect of his account with Defendant No.2 Bank.  Moreover, this contention is specifically negated by section 66 of the Trust Act.  The money received in the account was equivalent to hard cash.  It was not a mere book entry or a statement of accounts where no money is actually paid or received.  Defendant No.1 was liable to make good the loss caused by his breach of trust.  The Plaintiff is, in these circumstances, entitled to a charge over the whole fund for the amount due to it as it represents trust money which belongs to the Plaintiff.  [Para 45,46,47]\n\nThus the Plaintiff in these circumstances is entitled to injunction restraining the defendant No.1 from disposing the amount lying in his account in the defendant No.2 Bank in view of the provisions of S.38 of the Specific Relief Act.  That section 38(1) includes within its scope fiduciary duties of a Director is clear from section 2(a) which defines the term \"Obligation\" to include every duty enforceable by law.  [Para 50,55,61]\n\nTherefore, Defendant No.1 in his fiduciary capacity had an obligation to discharge his duties honestly.  Not having done so, he is under an obligation inter-alia under the provisions of the Trust Act to hold the benefit subject to the trust, for that money is comprised in the trust.  Had the entire cause of action arisen in India and the parties been subject to the jurisdiction of the Indian Courts, there is no doubt that the Plaintiff could have filed a suit for a declaration that the money is comprised in the trust and for a decree ordering Defendant No.1 to pay the same over to the Plaintiff.  In filing a suit to enforce such a right, therefore, the Plaintiff does not seek a mere inter-locutary injunction.  What is sought is a mandatory injunction of a final nature as contemplated under section 38 of the Specific Relief Act.  In view of a pre-existing cause of action that vests in the Plaintiff.  It cannot therefore be said that the injunction sought is merely ancillary or incidental to a pre-existing cause of action.  What the Plaintiff has however chosen to do is to limit the duration of this injunction until the hearing and disposal of the suit filed in the English Court and until the satisfaction in full of the decree, if any, passed against Defendant No.1.  The Plaintiff has thus chosen to limit the duration of its injunction and also make it dependent upon the outcome of the English proceedings.  If the Plaintiff succeeds in the English Court in obtaining the decree against Defendant No.1, it would be entitled to enforce the same under section 44-A of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.  In that sense, the Plaintiff has actually sought in this suit a relief less than it is entitled to seek.  The same cannot be denied.\t\t [Para 49,52,53,54]\n\nThough breach of trust emanated or commenced outside India and some or even all the parties involved therein reside outside India, Clause XII of the Letters Patent would entitle a Plaintiff to maintain such an action when a material part of the cause of action has arisen within the jurisdiction of Bombay High Court and leave in view thereof is obtained.

By virtue of his election as a Chairman of the proposed housing society he collected various amounts from the proposed members and purchased the land out of that amount and therefore, he was in the position as trustee qua, the proposed members of the society and must hold the property for their benefit. The trial Court's finding that the first Defendant had collected about Rs.12,000/- to Rs.13,000/- from the members is also fully justified and is based on both oral and documentary evidence on record. The evidence on record clearly show that the first Defendant was in the position as trustee and is liable to account for the purchase of the land, its sale, the sale proceeds and the amounts collected from the members.  [Para 12,13,14]\n\nDefendants Nos. 1 and 2  were in the position as trustees for the proposed members of the proposed society. Hence the suit though filed belatedly, is not barred by limitation and is within time, in view of S.10 of the Limitation Act.  [Para 15]\n\nThe Counsel for the Appellant is right in his criticism that the area mentioned by the trial Court is erroneous and has no basis. The trial court has not applied its mind to find out the available vacant space. It has just mentioned the same which has been mentioned in the plaint without applying its mind to point out whether the area mentioned in the plaint is correct or not. It can only be said that first Defendant is liable to account for the remaining available vacant space. The said portion of land is  very small piece of land and which cannot be given to the possession of the plaintiffs who are in large number. It cannot be divided among all the Plaintiffs. The best course is to sell the available vacant portion of land through court by way of public auction and then divide the proceeds among all the members. The first Defendant will have to account for all the amounts received from the members, the amount refunded by him to some of the members, the amount realised by him by way of mesne profit, the amount realised by him from 16 purchasers to whom he sold 16 plots. Hence the decree of the trial Court will have to be modified on these points.  [Para 17]"

The English principle followed is that in contentious matters Section 74 cannot be invoked and the party will have to be relegated to a Suit. The Indian Trusts Act, as pointed out in Section 60, Illustration (e) also provides for such a situation. Apart from that, a look at Sections 73 and 74 would indicate that Section 74 steps in only when appointment under Section 73 becomes impracticable. The appointment under Section 73 can be made in the event a vacancy arises or principal civil court of original jurisdiction holds that the person is unfit or personally incapable to act in the trust. The trustees cannot decide and fill in the vacancy if there are disputes. Can it then be said that as it is impracticable to make appointments under Section 73 and therefore appointments are to be made under Section 74. Also if the Court opines that a vacancy has arisen then an appointment can be made by the persons named in the Trust. This opinion in Section 73, or appointment in Section 74 if there is a vacancy should be read with Section 60. Sections in an Act must be read harmoniously. A construction which renders any Section otiose cannot be adopted. The intent of the Legislature must be given effect to. The present Act is a preindependence Act. It will therefore be safe to accept that interpretation, bearing in mind that this Court can also exercise equity jurisdiction.  [Para 9]\n\nIn this case the removal of the trustees was sought for various acts as set out in the plaint. These acts, would involve the character of the Trustees. The Court therefore will have to examine as to whether in fact the allegations are supported by material after evidence has been led. This will require investigation into facts. In the Petition, the Petitioners themselves have set out that a Petition arises out of the wrong done by the trustees to the Petitioners which is a continuous wrong. The Petition therefore, involves contentious issues and the preliminary objections on behalf of the Respondents that this Court has no jurisdiction in a petition under Section 74 to decide the contentious issues and relegate the petitioner to a Suit will have to be accepted.  In the course of the proceedings Respondent No.1 expired. His heirs have been brought on record. This could only be if relief is still available against the original Trustee. Secondly even though a vacancy has arisen it is contended that there are already apart from Respondent No.2, two other corporate Trustees, and the Trust can function as it requires minimum two trustees. The petitioners dispute the same. All these issues also can be decided by way of a Suit and not in a Petition under Section 74. The reliefs are not consequential.  [Para 10]"

An application would be maintainable on any present questions.  Such questions must arise 'respecting management or administration of trust property'. The questions should not be of any 'detail, difficulty or importance or otherwise not proper in the opinion of court for summary disposal'.  If an opinion is rendered, or advice is given, or a direction is issued, same shall be deemed, so far trustee is concerned, in regard to his own responsibility to have discharged his duty as such trustee in the subject matter of the application. It may be that such application may be filed without instituting a suit but maintainability of such application would mainly depend upon nature and purport thereof.  Merely an option has been conferred on a trustee to file either a suit or to move court for its opinion, advice or direction in terms of Section 34 of the Act, such option can be exercised only when recourse to both remedies are available.  The jurisdiction of court is not only confined to opinion or advice but also extends to issuance of direction, but such opinion rendered, or advice given or direction issued only to a trustee.  Consequence of issuance of such a direction is also stated in paragraph 3 of section 34 in terms whereof a legal fiction is created by reason whereof the trustee would be deemed to have discharged his obligation in regard to his own responsibility in subject matter of application. It does not envisage adjudication. It does not ordinarily envisage determination of right, title or interest of a member of trust or a beneficiary in relation to trust property, although such a question may have to be incidentally dealt with.  The provision of S.34 must be given its literal meaning. Court cannot exercise a jurisdiction which is not vested in it. [Para 18,19,20,21,22]\n\nIn this case right of a member of a trust to receive pension poses a difficult question. It may pose a question of importance, keeping in view the fact that by reason thereof, obligation of trustee would come to an end. It is one thing to say that an advice, opinion or direction can be made respecting administration of trust; but what that means would evidently depend upon terms of the trust deed.  Part II of trust deed lays down mode and manner in which trust properties are to be administered. It does not lay down a right on part of trustee to put an end to his right to get himself discharged from his obligation. If for some reason or other, it is contended by trustee that trust stand extinguished, any remedy in respect thereof must be found within Chapter VIII and not otherwise.   [Para 25,26]\n\nThe courts have all along held that their jurisdiction, in this behalf, is limited.  In any event, it is for the court concerned to arrive at an opinion as to whether questions posed are matters of detail, difficulty or importance. Summary jurisdiction would not be exercised in the event the exclusionary clause comes into operation.   Even if it is assumed that application under Section 34 was maintainable, court, however, keeping in view number of persons who would be entitled to oppose prayer of extinction of trust, would decline to exercise its jurisdiction. Interpretation of trust deed furthermore is a question of importance. It is also a matter of detail in the proceeding as to whether the trustees have been able to discharge their entire liabilities.  High Court opined that trust is an irrevocable one. It may or may not be correct; but question posed admittedly is a difficult one and if for said purpose it had refused to exercise its discretionary jurisdiction, no fault can be found therewith.

Despite the above, there is no indication of the maximum duration for which a suspension order can be in operation. Keeping in mind the requirements of proportionality, we are of the opinion that an order suspending the aforesaid services indefinitely is impermissible. In this context, it is necessary to lay down some procedural safeguard till the aforesaid deficiency is cured by the legislature to ensure that the exercise of power under the Suspension Rules is not disproportionate. We therefore direct that the Review Committee constituted under Rule 2(5) of the Suspension Rules must conduct a periodic review within seven working days of the previous review, in terms of the requirements under Rule 2(6). The Review Committee must therefore not only look into the question of whether the restrictions are still in compliance with the requirements of Section 5(2) of the Telegraph Act, but must also look into the question of whether the orders are still proportionate, keeping in mind the constitutional consequences of the same. We clarify that looking to the fact that the restrictions contemplated under the Suspension Rules are temporary in nature, the same must not be allowed to extend beyond that time period which is necessary.\t\t\t [Para 100]"

Despite the above, there is no indication of the maximum duration for which a suspension order can be in operation. Keeping in mind the requirements of proportionality, we are of the opinion that an order suspending the aforesaid services indefinitely is impermissible. In this context, it is necessary to lay down some procedural safeguard till the aforesaid deficiency is cured by the legislature to ensure that the exercise of power under the Suspension Rules is not disproportionate. We therefore direct that the Review Committee constituted under Rule 2(5) of the Suspension Rules must conduct a periodic review within seven working days of the previous review, in terms of the requirements under Rule 2(6). The Review Committee must therefore not only look into the question of whether the restrictions are still in compliance with the requirements of Section 5(2) of the Telegraph Act, but must also look into the question of whether the orders are still proportionate, keeping in mind the constitutional consequences of the same. We clarify that looking to the fact that the restrictions contemplated under the Suspension Rules are temporary in nature, the same must not be allowed to extend beyond that time period which is necessary.

(1908), S.9, O.39, R 1 and 2 - Right to Strike - Negative obligation imposed on workmen by S.22 does not tantamount to positive right in favour of employer - Right to strike is not conferred either in Constitution or by any other statute - Statute only seeks to restrict inherent right in every individual in the larger interest of society - Relief in the form of permanent injunction and interim relief is not beyond jurisdiction of Tribunal - Hence civil suit to restrain employees from going on strike cannot be brought in civil court.\n\nA Civil suit to restrain the employees from going on a strike, irrespective of whether the proposed strike is legal or illegal under a special statute, cannot be brought in a civil Court. 1996 (II) LLJ 52 or 2000 (85) FLR 144 Dissented from.  [Para 36]\n\nThere are two difficulties in accepting the contention that the negative obligation imposed on workmen by Section 22 amounts to a positive right in favour of the employer, the employer is entitled to enforce those rights by resorting to action in civil court. In the first place, every obligation may not create a corresponding right in any particular or specific person.  Often times statutes prescribed obligations, that too in a negative manner, which are intended for the benefit of the public at large.  These are obligations owed to the society as a whole.  No one person is entitled to say that they crate a right in his favour.  If at all, it is for the society at large or the body politic to enforce them.  A Suit by any individual to enforce such an obligation in public domain would not be entertainable.  [Para 18]\n\nAn obligation owed  to the community at large cannot be enforced by an individual on the footing that he is a part of the community at large.  [Para 20]\n\nThe obligations of a workman or Trade Union contemplated by Section 22 are obligations in realm, enforceable by the society at large.  The only manner in which the statute contemplates their enforcement is indicated in Section 26 of the Act which prescribes a penalty for any workman who commences, continues or otherwise acts in furtherance of a strike which is illegal under the Act, the penalty being imprisonment for a term which may extend to one month or with fine which may extend to fifty rupees, or with both.  In the entire body of the  Industrial Disputes Act, there is neither any indication, or provision of the manner in which the obligations under Section 22 are to be enforced.  [Para 21]\n\nThe obligation not to go on strike, without following the prescribed steps, even assuming it is enforceable at the instance of an individual, is an obligation not arising from the general law of contract, nor common law.  This is an obligation which is prescribed under a special statute, namely, Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.  There is no reason why this cannot constitute an \"industrial dispute\" within the meaning of Section 2(k) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947.  [Para 23]\n\nThe right to go on strike is not conferred either by the Constitution or by any other statute.  On the other hand, statute recognises this as inherent right to every human being who has to render service to another, but seeks to restrict it in the larger interests of society. 1961 II LLJ 385 Ref.  [Para 28]\n\nReading of the two Schedules appended to the Act in conjunction with the definition of expression \"industrial dispute\" defined in Section 2(k) of the Industrial Disputes Act, it is not possible to accept the contention that a relief in the form of permanent injunction is beyond the jurisdiction of the Tribunal upon a properly worded reference. Maybe it takes time to get the relief, but the relief is possible.  The wheels of gods grind exceedingly slow; but they grind exceedingly fine.  So is the case with Industrial Tribunals.  [Para 31]\n\nIt cannot be contended that there is no power in the Industrial Tribunal to grant interim relief. In the first place, the definition of the expression \"Award\" under Section 2(b) of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 includes an interim determination of any industrial dispute or of any question relating thereto by the Tribunal.  Further, the power of an Industrial Tribunal under Section 10(4) to adjudicate on matters \"incidental\" to the points of dispute referred for adjudication would conceivably include its power to grant interim relief.

[Para 16]\n\nSection 28(1A) makes no reference to any particular Court for which an application has to be made by the person who wants to get the certificate for referring the dispute. Section 28 does not restrict the jurisdiction of the Industrial Court in any manner, so as to have the limitations on the rights of the parties to get their disputes restricted to any particular court. The word used in Section 28(1A) is only the Industrial Court without any further specific reference to any specific Court situated at a specific or a particular place. This clearly means so far as regards referring the dispute to the Industrial Court is concerned, then an irresistible conclusion has to be drawn that it has to go to the Court which has the territorial jurisdiction over the dispute or over the parties concerned.  [Para 9,14]\n\nThe parent Act does not refer to any particular Court. Parent Act only refers to the necessary certificate to be obtained for reference of the dispute to the Industrial Court. Regulation of 1927 is a procedural matter to be adopted while giving effect to the provisions of the Act. Forms prescribed under \"K\" \"L\" and \"M\" are for the benefit of the litigant and the authorities and suggesting as to how the authorities are supposed to grant certificate. However neither Regulation 23 nor forms prescribed thereunder would be in a position to control the jurisdiction of any particular Court which is conferred on the Court under Section 28(1A) of the Act; else it would create chaos. Since the applicant at the relevant time i.e. at the time of making the application, was well within the territorial jurisdiction of Nasik Court, he referred it as Court at Nasik, which clearly means that the applicant at that particular time, was aware of the fact that his dispute was to be entertained by the Nasik Court only.  The Court at Jalgaon has come into existence or is constituted and established on July 5, 1999. It means that when the consent certificate was granted, even till then no Court had come into existence at Jalgaon. Therefore, the certificate also refers to the name of the town Nasik and not Jalgaon. Therefore, when a consent certificate is granted it would not be appropriate to restrict the jurisdiction to court at 'Nasik' only. The Court at 'Jalgaon' is competent to entertain the dispute.  [Para 14]\n\nFurther, the Registrar to whom a reference is made happened to be the same even for the purpose of Industrial Court at Jalgaon. In short, the Registrar at Nasik since the establishment of the Industrial Court at Jalgaon is also competent to refer the dispute to Jalgaon Court also and it is so clear from the fact that on 7th July 1999 all the disputes which otherwise fell within the jurisdiction of Nasik Court have been transferred to Industrial Court at Jalgaon.

The Section specifically provides that it can be only invoked by a person who has been a member of such registered trade union for a period of not less than 6 months. The words \"where there is a dispute as respects whether or not any person is an office-bearer or member of a registered trade union\" has to be read along with the words \"any member of such registered union for a period not less than six months.\" A person whose application for membership has not been considered or al- lowed would not have been a member for six months. It is a cardinal rule of interpretation that if two interpretations are possible, one of which leads to a harmonious reading of the entire provision and another which renders a portion nugatory then the former interpretation has to be accepted. The interpretation given by the High Court leads to the requirement of a person being a member for six months being rendered nugatory. However if it is held that the dispute \"as to whether a person is a member or not\" is necessarily a dispute in respect of a person who was already a member for a period of not less than six months, but whose membership is being disputed then no portion of the section gets rendered nugatory. Thus it will have to be held that dispute between persons who are not members and the Union would not be covered by Section 28(1-A). Further a dispute between a person who is not yet a member and a union would not be an internal dispute of the union.  [Para 7]\n\nUnder S.28(1-A) the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is barred only in respect of matters which have been referred to an Industrial Court under Section 28(1-A). If a dispute does not fall under Section 28(1-A) then that dispute can always be taken to a Civil Court. As a dispute whether a person should or should not be admitted as a member is not a dispute falling within Section 28(1-A) it would always be open to such persons to approach a Civil Court for resolution of their dispute. Needless to say that if the law permits they may also raise an industrial dispute before the Industrial Court in that behalf.  [Para 8]"

The inquiry which is to be held by the Registrar does not contemplate preliminary adjudication of dispute but holding of summary scrutiny. The summary scrutiny obviously has to be made to find out whether preliminary requisites for filing the application are made out viz that such an application is made by any member or registered Trade Union which is in existence for a period of not less than six months. Secondly, to find out whether the dispute falls within the parameters laid down under section 28(1A) viz (i) whether any person is an office bearer or not, (ii) whether the dispute is relating to wrongful expulsion and (iii) whether the dispute is relating to property of Trade Union. Any other dispute, obviously, cannot be referred to and it is for that purpose the said inquiry appears to have been contemplated and that appears to be the intention of the legislature in incorporating the need to obtain consent. Perusal of Regulation 23 also discloses that the Registrar is supposed to make such inquiries as he may deem fit and upon his satisfaction, he may refer the dispute. Upon conjoint reading of section 28(1A) and Regulation 23, it would be abundantly clear that the legislature never intended to put burden upon a member of the registered Trade Union who wishes to raise a dispute on the three aspects mentioned in the said section of proving the dispute twice, first before the Registrar and then before the Industrial Court. There does not appear to be any reason to believe that the legislature had in its mind two tier system of adjudication, firstly at the stage of Registrar and secondly at the stage of Industrial Court. If such an interpretation is made, it would defeat the purpose for which the provision has been incorporated by the Maharashtra Amendment Act viz to permit any member of a registered Trade Union to agitate against the three disputes referred to in the said section. If such an exercise is undertaken, it would be unending affair and office bearer of the registered Trade Union would continue to perpetuate illegalities which are alleged against them. \t     [Para 13]\n\nThe inquiry which is contemplated to be made under the said provision is only for the purpose of finding out whether dispute exists and the Registrar is not expected to dwell deep and decide whether dispute has really any substance that it may ultimately succeed. The legislature appears to have put a filter in the form of obtaining consent of the Registrar in order to ensure that the Industrial Court is not flooded with frivolous disputes          [Para 14]\n\nIf the said satisfaction which is to be arrived at by the Registrar is construed to mean that he has to dwell deep into the matter and see whether the complaint is likely to be successful if it is filed, it would defeat the very purpose of the said provision. If such an interpretation is given then the office bearers may continue till the proceedings continue and are concluded at the stage of Registrar and during their term the matter may not reach before the Industrial Court\t   [Para 15]"

It is not in dispute that the Central Government has already delegated powers in this behalf and in connection with registration of a trade union to the State. The respondent union was required to apply at Bombay because its head office is located at Bombay. It is required to be noted that after the 1952 notification referred to above, the same Registrar is exercising the powers for registration of a particular trade union within the State and the same officer is authorised to register a union, whose activities are not only confined to the State but it is a multi-state Union. If the respondent union wanted to get itself registered as a multi-state union, it was required to approach only the State Registrar at Bombay. In view of the same, simply because respondent union had given an application at Bombay and the Registrar at Bombay has registered the said union itself is not an indicative fact that the said union has got registered itself in the State of Maharashtra and it can function at the State level. Since the respondent union was having its head office at Bombay, it had no other alternative but to apply for registration at Bombay. \n\nIf the activities of the union are restricted to one State, then naturally such union cannot represent itself beyond the State and the appropriate Government in such case would be the State Government. In other cases where the union is operating beyond the State, then in such an eventuality, the appropriate Government would be the Central Government. The registration is only one. The Registrar is only one and the same officer is exercising powers of entertaining the application for registration. There is nothing on record to suggest that there were two separate registers maintained or not. It is true that as on today, after the deletion of 1938 Central Regulations, the only Regulation which can be said to be existence is State Regulations. Simply because the Central Regulations are not in existence should not mean that no union, whose activities are at the multi-state level, can ever apply for registration at all. In the absence of Central Regulations, it is for the State Registrar to adopt his own procedure. It is true, that by delegation of powers to the State Registrar, the Regulations of the Central Government are not delegated. However, in a given case, the Registrar may apply appropriate procedure as he deems fit at the time of registering a particular union for the purpose of giving registration. It is required to be noted that as per the Regulation, the union is required to apply for registration whose activities are beyond the particular State and is all India level. It is not possible to agree with the submission of Mr. Cama that in such an eventuality if the respondent union wanted to have its operations beyond particular state, it is required to apply for registration in every State. The said submission is required to be rejected as the Union is required to apply only where its head office is located.  [Para 23,24]"

It is such that the fate of not only the accused but co-accused, abettor and conspirator depends upon it. It can result in the hanging of accused and co-accused etc. Relying on it, punishment up to death penalty can be imposed on the maker as also on others.  [Para 32]\n\nThe contemporaneous record has to support the deposition in Court. If the recording officer without contemporaneous record is allowed to depose later after lapse of several years in Court, it would be too hazardous to rely on such testimony as, ordinarily, an officer is likely to depose in Court what was left out to be recorded in documents as per mandatory provisions of the Act and the Rules, once he knows that he had made vital omission. If the contemporaneous record shows that in substance though not in form, the requirements of the Rule were fulfilled, the defect of form can be cured by oral deposition made, may be after many years, on the basis of the contemporaneous record.  [Para 37]\n\nTo conclude : A.\tWriting the certificate and making the memorandum under Rule 15(3)(b) is mandatory.\n\nB.\tThe language of the certificate and the memorandum is not mandatory.\n\nC.\tIn case the certificate and memorandum is not prepared but the contemporaneous record shows substantial compliance of what is required to be contained therein, the discrepancy can be cured if there is oral evidence of recording officer based on such contemporaneous record.\n\nD.\tIn absence of contemporaneous record, discrepancy cannot be cured by oral evidence based on memory of the recording officer. \n\nIn the present case, admittedly Rule 15(3)(b) has not been complied. No memorandum as required was made. There is also no contemporaneous record to show the satisfaction of the recording officer after writing of confession that the confession has been voluntarily made. The confession of accused No. 7 does not even state that it was read over to him. Thus, confessional statements are inadmissible and cannot be made basis of upholding the conviction."

Whether such confession requires corroboration depends on the facts of the given case. If the Court is convinced that the probative value of the confession is such that it does not require corroboration then the same can be used for convicting the maker and/or co-accused under the Act and/or other enactments without independent corroboration. If a person accused of committing an offence under the Act challenges his confession on the ground that it was not made voluntarily, then the initial burden is on the prosecution to prove that all requirements under Section 15 of the Act and Rule 15 of the Rules have been complied with. Once this is done, the burden shifts on the accused person and it is for him to prove that the confession was not made voluntarily or that the same is not truthful and if he adduces evidence during the trial to substantiate his allegation that the confession was not voluntary then the Court has to carefully scrutinize the entire evidence and surrounding circumstances and determine whether or not the confession was voluntary. The confession made under Section 15 of the Act cannot be discarded only on the ground of violation of the guidelines laid down in Kartar Singh's case reported in 1994(3) SCC 569 because the same have not been incorporated in the Act and/or the Rules.\n\nIn the present case, before recording confessions of appellant Nos.A-4 to A-8 and A-10, the two officers viz. Shri. A.K. Majumdar and Shri. Harbhajan Ram explained to each of them separately that he is not bound to make confession and that if he does so, the same may be used as evidence against him. The concerned officers also recorded their satisfaction that the appellants were making confessions voluntarily and that no threat or allurement was given to any of them and nobody had coerced them to make confession. Each of the six appellants was given time to think on the issue of making confession and having felt convinced that they were doing so out of their volition, the officers recorded their statements. The confessions of six appellants were typed by the stenographer on Hindi typewriter. The same were read over to the accused who admitted that the recording contains full and true account of his statement and then signed it. The officers also recorded their observations about voluntary character of the confessions and then singed the same. The statements of the six appellants were immediately sent to Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi for onward transmission to the Designated Court at Ahmedabad. All this shows that there was total compliance of Section 15 of the Act and Rule 15 of the Rules.  1994(3) SCC 569 - Ref.to.   [Para 27,42]"

Any confession made in defiance of the safeguards provided therein, would not be relied upon by a court.  The confession should be made voluntarily without there being any force or pressure put on, or allurement or inducement given to, a person who is voluntarily admitting his guilt.

Although there are certain exceptions in the preceding provisions, but the fact remains that as a rule a confession made to the police officer is not made admissible under the Evidence Act.  The idea appears to be that any statement made to a police officer who is connected with the investigation and prosecution of a person, would not be taken as evidence.  Under Section 15 of the TADA Act, if a confession made by the accused to a police officer not lower than the rank of Superintendent of Police is made admissible, it would still be a confession made to the police officer, and thus inbuilt safeguards have been provided under Section 15 of the TADA Act read with Rule 15 of the TADA Rules so as to lend credence to the confession made to the police officer, it being voluntarily and without any force or pressure and allurement or inducement.\n\nIt is necessary for the police officer to certify that he has explained to the accused that the accused is not bound to make a confession and if he does so such confession may be used as evidence against him.  It is further required to be recorded that he believes that the confession was voluntarily made.  He has to record that the confessional statement has been taken in his presence and hearing and recorded by him.  The confessional statement should be read over to the person making it and admitted by him to be correct and it should be certified that it contains a full and true account of the statement made by the accused.  The certificate which is required to be given by the police officer is not a mere formality, but it is for the purposes of ascertaining that the police officer has recorded the confession keeping in mind and being fully aware of the fact that the confession recorded by him is a voluntary confession and with the information available to the accused that he is not bound to make such confession and if he does so it will be used as evidence against him.  A duty is cast on the police officer who is to record the confession to bring at the relevant time these facts to the notice of the person whose confession is going to be recorded. 2004 ALL MR (Cri) 3428 (S.C.) and 2004 ALL MR (Cri) 1171 (S.C.) - Ref. to.\t [Para 49,50]"

If ultimately the title of the pendente lite transferor is upheld as valid in regard to the transferred property, the transferee's title will not be affected. But if the title of the pendente lite transferor is recognized or accepted valid only in regard to a part of the transferred property, then the transferee's title will be protected only in regard to that extent and the transfer in regard to the remaining portion of the transferred property to which the transferor is found not entitled, will be invalid and the transferee will not get any right, title or interest in that portion. If the property transferred pendente lite, is allotted entirely to some other party or parties to the suit or if the transferor is held to have no right or title to convey that property, the transferee will not have any title to the property. Petitioner admitted that her sale deed was executed during the pendency of the partition suit and the suit was decided.

It is expected that the courts would operate the sentencing system so as to impose such sentence which reflects the conscience of the society and the sentencing process has to be stern where it should be. Any liberal attitude by imposing meager sentences or taking too sympathetic view merely on account of lapse of time in respect of such offences will be result-wise counter productive in the long run and against the interest of society which needs to be cared for and strengthened by string of deterrence inbuilt in the sentencing system. Justice demands that courts should impose punishment befitting the crime so that the courts reflect public abhorrence of the crime. The court must not only keep in view the rights of the victim of the crime and the society at large while considering the imposition of appropriate punishment. The Court will be failing in its duty if appropriate punishment is not awarded for a crime which has been committed not only against the individual victim but also against the society to which both the criminal and the victim belong.

The Court can act upon it in spite of its retraction if it inspires confidence in the mind of the Judge, however, the rule of corroboration evolved by this Court as a matter of prudence in relation to a retracted confession recorded by a Magistrate under Cr.P.C. need not be dispensed with. Viewing the confession in the light of other evidence on record and seeking corroborative support therefrom is only a process of ascertaining the truth of the confession. Viewed from another angle, it cannot be said that a confession recorded by a police officer under the special enactment should have more sanctity and higher degree of acceptability so as to dispense with the normal rule of corroboration and leave it to the discretion of the court whether to insist on corroboration or not, even if it is retracted. The better view would be to follow the same rule of prudence as is being followed in the case of confessions under general law. The confessional statement recorded by the police officer can be the basis of conviction of the maker, but it is desirable to look to corroboration in a broad sense, when it is retracted.  The non obstante provision should not, affect the operation of the general rule of corroboration broadly.\t [Para 9]"

                ],
                "description": "Difference between two provisions.\n\nPer S.S.M. Quadri, J. (Dissenting) - The difference between Section 30 of the Indian Evidence Act and Section 15(1) of the TADA Act may also be noticed here. Whereas the former provision requires that the maker of the confession and others should be tried jointly for the same offence, the latter provision does not require that joint trial should be for the same offence. Another point of distinction is that under Section 30 of the Evidence Act, the  Court is given discretion to take into consideration the confession against the maker as well as against those who are being tried jointly for the same offence, but Section 15(1) of TADA Act mandates that confession of an accused recorded thereunder shall be admissible in the trial of the maker of confession or co-accused, abettor or conspirator, provided the co-accused, abettor or conspirator is charged and tried with the accused in the same case. Both Section 30 of the Evidence Act as well as Section 15 of the TADA Act require joint trial of the accused making confession and co-accused, abettor or conspirator.\n\nHaving excluded the application of Section 24 to 30 of the Evidence Act to a confession recorded under Section 15(1) of the TADA Act, a self-contained scheme is incorporated therein for recording confession of an accused and its admissibility in his trial with co-accused, abettor or conspirator for offences under the TADA Act or the rules made thereunder or any other offence under any other law which can jointly be tried with the offence with which he is charged at the same trial. There is thus no room to import the requirements of Section 30 of the Evidence Act in Section 15 of the TADA Act.\n\nUnder Section 15(1) of the TADA Act the position, in my view, is much stronger. On the language of sub-section (1) of Section 15 a confession of an accused is made admissible evidence as against all those tried jointly with him, so it is implicit that the same can be considered against all those tried together. In this view of the matter also. Section 30 of the Evidence Act need not be invoked for consideration of confession of an accused against a co-accused, abettor or conspirator charged and tried in the same case along with the accused.\n\n1998 ALL MR (Cri) 240 (S.C.)  Dissented from.  [Para 680,682]\n\n(ZA) Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act (1987), S.21(1) (As amended in 1993) - Presumption of innocence.\n\nPer S.S.M. Quadri, J. :- The normal presumption in criminal cases is that till it is proved to the contrary the accused will be deemed to be innocent and that position is altered by S.21(1). After deletion of clauses (c) and (d) by Act 43 of 1993 the statutory presumption under S.21(1) will not apply to situations where a confession is made by a co-accused that the accused had committed the offence (clause (c)) or where the accused himself made a confession of the offence to any person other than a police officer (clause (d)) and the normal rule of presumption of innocence of the accused will apply. What was in the realm of 'as proved' has after the amendment become only substantive evidence admissible as against the co-accused.  [Para 693]\n\nAfter the amendment of S. 21(1), the confession of an accused recorded by the police officer under S.15(1) of the TADA Act is in the same position as that recorded  by a Magistrate under S.164, Cr. P.C. and that it cannot be placed on a higher pedestal in regard to its evidential value. If that be so,  in a trial under the TADA Act when there are two categories of confessions-one a judicial confession recorded by a Magistrate under S. 164, Cr.P.C. and the other by a police officer under S.15(1) of the TADA Act, the Court will have to give the same evidential value to such confessions as against the co-accused.  [Para 696]\n\n(ZB)  Penal Code (1860), S.302 - Criminal P.C. (1973), S.354(3) - Punishment.\n\nPer S.S.M. Quadri, J. :- The Indian Penal Code gives a very wide discretion to the Court in the matter of awarding punishment. The maximum and the minimum punishments are prescribed under the IPC and awarding of appropriate punishment is left to the discretion of the Court. There are no general guidelines in the IPC but in the exercise of its discretion the Courts have to take into consideration the aggravating and mitigating circumstances of each case to determine appropriate sentence commensurate with the gravity of the offence and role of the convict.\n\nOn the question of awarding the sentence for the offences for which the punishment prescribed is life imprisonment or the death sentence, there has been a complete change in the legislative policy which is reflected in sub-sec. (3) of S. 354 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It enjoins that in the case in which the Court awards sentence of death, the judgment shall state special reasons for such sentence.  [Para 703,704]\n\n(ZC)  Constitution of India, Art.20(2) - Criminal P.C. (1973), S.300 - Protection against second trial.\n\nPER K.T. THOMAS, J.:- Though Article 20(2) of the Constitution of India embodies a protection against second trial after a conviction for the same offence, the ambit of the sub-article is narrower than the protection afforded by Section 300 of the Procedure Code. It is held by this Court in Manipur Administration v. Thokehom Bira Singh, AIR 1965 SC 87 that \"if there is no punishment for the offence as a result of the prosecution, Article 20(2) has no application\". While the sub-article embodies the principle of autrefois convict, Section 300 of the Procedure Code combines both autrefois convict and autrefois acquit.\n\nSection 300 has further widened the protective wings by debarring a second trial against the same accused on the same facts even for a different offence if a different charge against him for such offence could have been made under Section 221 (1) of the Code, or he could have been convicted for such other offence under Section 221(2) of the Code.

In such a situation when the Judge of Designated Court ceased to have jurisdiction on account of abolition of that Court, the Sessions Judge to whom the case is transferred for trial of the offences charged (after dropping out the offences under TADA) must he regarded as a successor Judge. It is immaterial that such successor Judge cannot try the offence under TADA or that in the trial before a Designated Court certain items of materials could be admitted as evidence which could not get such admission in the trial before regular criminal Courts.  [Para 20]\n\nIf the successor Judge is of opinion that further examination of any witness, whose evidence has already been recorded is necessary in the interest of justice, the Judge would resummon such witness either for further examination or further cross-examination and re-examination.

Section 12 specifically empowers the Designated Court to hear and try any other offence with which the accused may, under the Code, be charged, if the trial of that offence is connected with such other offence under the Act.  Therefore in a case where a person is facing trial for the offence under TADA and also under any other law and the confession is made under section 15 of the Act, use of it is possible or permissible in law by the Designated Court.  This advantage of the prosecution and dis-advantage of the accused is not available under the regular law namely the Code and the Evidence Act.  This section therefore creates a right in the prosecution to use a confession if made to a Superintendent of police and recorded by him as it is made admissible by this section.  This right would not be available to the prosecution if it goes before a regular court under the Code.  When the prosecution wants to withdraw the prosecution before the Designated Court, the accused gets a right that confession made under section 15 cannot thereafter be used in the regular trial before the Court under the Code.  Both these rights are available and both of them are finally decided by the order passed under section 321 of the Code and 18 of the Tada Act.  This being the impact of withdrawal of the prosecution under section 321, grant or refusal thereof will have to be construed as final.  1992(3) BCR 292 - Referred to.\t [Para 18]"

Surely, seeking extension for time to complete investigation resulting in keeping the accused in further custody is a very serious matter and while submitting such report, application of mind by the public prosecutor is a must. Similarly, Section 20(8) of the TADA states that no person, who is charged with an offence under the MCOCA shall be released on bail unless the public prosecutor has been given an opportunity to oppose the bail application. Offences under the TADA being serious, release of an accused on bail has serious import and therefore, the legislature has purposely referred to the public prosecutor in this section. His application of mind to the prayer for bail is a must. The legislative intent is clear that while dealing with bail application, the view of the public prosecutor must be considered by the Special Court. The provisions concerning bail and, submission of report praying for extension of time to complete investigation resulting in extending the custody of the accused, cannot be equated with Section 10 of the MCOCA. As Section 10 of the MCOCA contains a mandate. It does not refer to the public prosecutor. It confers no discretion on anyone. It says that other cases shall remain stayed and, therefore, the Sessions Court, Mumbai, committed no illegality in following the mandate of Section 10 of the MCOCA. It was duty bound to do so.

A combined reading of Sections 8 and 19 of the Act and Section 84(4) of the Code makes it abundantly clear that the person not being a proclaimed offender against whom an order is passed under Section 8 of the Act read with Section 84 of the Code has the remedy of filing a suit which reflects the intention of the Legislature to treat the order of the Designated Court, in so far as it affects the third party claimant, to be an interlocutory order.  Such an order would, however, be deemed to be a final order so far as the prosecution, the State and the proclaimed offender are concerned particularly in view of the provisions of Section 86 of the Code.  Interlocutory order in law means, not that which decides the cause but which only settles intervening matter relating to the cause.  Such an order is made pending the cause and before the final hearing on the merits.  It is made to secure some end and purpose necessary and essential to the progress of the case and generally collateral to the issues to be settled by the Court in the final judgment.  Orders summoning witnesses, adjourning cases, passing orders for bail, calling for reports, attaching the properties (with the exception of Section 86) and such other steps in the aid of pending proceedings shall amount to be interlocutory orders against which no appeal can be preferred with the aid of Section 19 of the Act.  As the order attaching the property in so far as relates to the claimant third party, is subject to the decision of the Civil Court, it cannot be held to be a final order.  [Para 6]\n\nUpon a harmonious intepretation of the various provisions of the Act and the Code, there is no escape from the position that the order passed by the Designated Court under Section 84 of the Code in so far as it relates to the third party rights of the claimant is only an interlocutory order and not final orders for which an appeal could be filed under Section 19 of the Act.  But if such aggrieved claimant does not choose to challenge the order by way of a suit, such order would become final so far as the State is concerned.  It may be noted in this context that a suit can be filed only at the instance of the person whose claims or objections are disallowed. Hence, when the claims or objections are upheld the aggrieved party can avail himself of the remedy under Section 19 of the Act.\t\t [Para 7]"

It is also necessary to find out the legislative intent for enacting it. It defines \"terrorist acts\"  in S. 2(h) with reference to S.3(1) and in that context defines a terrorist. It is not possible to define the expression 'terrorism' in precise terms. It is derived from the word 'terror'.  As far as the Statement of Objects and Reasons leading to enactment of the TADA is concerned, reference to the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1985 (hereinafter referred to as the 'old Act') is necessary. It appears that the intended object of the said Act was to deal with persons responsible for escalation of terrorist activities in many parts of the country. It was expected that it would be possible to control the menace within a period of two years, and life of the Act was restricted to the period of two years from the date of its commencement. But noticing the continuance of menace, that too on a larger scale TADA has been enacted. Menace of terrorism is not restricted to our country, and it has become a matter of international concern and the attacks on the World Trade Centre and other places on 11th September, 2001 amply show it. Attack on the Parliament on 13th December, 2001 shows how grim the situation  is. TADA is applied as an extreme measure when police fails to tackle with the situation under the ordinary penal law. Whether the criminal act was committed with an intention to strike terror in the people or section of people would depend upon the facts of each case. For finding out the intention of the accused, there would hardly be a few cases where there would be direct evidence. It has to be mainly inferred from the circumstances of each case.\t\t\t [Para 1]"

A confessional statement recorded by a Police Officer not below the rank of Superintendent of Police under S. 15 of the TADA is admissible, while it is not so admissible unless made to the Magistrate under S.25 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (in short the 'Evidence Act'). It appears consideration of a confessional statement of an accused to a police officer except to the extent permitted under S. 27 of the Evidence Act is not permissible.\n\nThe crux of making a statement voluntarily is, what is intentional, intended, unemployed by other influences, acting on one's own will, through his own conscience. Such confessional statements are made mostly out of a thirst to speak the truth which at a given time predominates in the heart of the confessor which impels him to speak out the truth internal compulsion of the conscience to speak out the truth normally emerges when one is in despondency or in a perilous situation when he wants to shed his cloak of guilt and nothing but disclosing the truth would dawn on him. It sometimes becomes so powerful that he is ready to face all consequences for clearing his heart.\t\t\t\t [Para 3]\n\nLaw is clear that a confession cannot be used against an accused person unless the Court is satisfied that it was voluntary. At that stage question whether it is true or false does not arise. If the facts and circumstances surrounding the making of a confession appear to cast a doubt on the voluntariness of the confession, the Court may refuse to act upon the confession, even if it is admissible in evidence. The question whether a confession is voluntary or not is always a question of fact.  A free and voluntary confession is deserving of highest credit, because it is presumed to flow from the highest sense of guilt.     \t [Para 4]"

But if any subsequent legislation would downgrade the harshness of the sentence for the same offence, it would be a salutary principle for administration of criminal justice to suggest that the said legislative benevolence can be extended to the accused who awaits judicial verdict regarding sentence.  [Para 32]\n\nThere is inconsistency between the sentencing scope in S. 3(2) of TADA 1985 and in the corresponding provision in TADA 1987. The expression \"in any enactment other than this Act\" would, under S. 25, encompass even enactment which, though expired by efflux of time, continues to operate by virtue of any saving clause. Accordingly, the exclusivity of the extreme sentence contained in S. 3(2) of TADA 1985 must stand superseded by the corresponding benevolent provision in TADA 1987. It is a permissible course and the express prohibition contained in Art. 20(1) of the Constitution -is not a bar for resorting to the corresponding sub-section in TADA 1987.

In view of the aforesaid ban imposed by the Legislature, Section 15 of the TADA provides an exception to the ban.  But it is well to remember that other confessions which are admissible even under the Evidence Act could be used as against a co-accused only upon satisfaction of certain conditions.\n\nThe first condition is that there should be a confession i.e. inculpatory statement.  Any exculpatory admission is not usable for any purpose whatsoever as against a co-accused.  The second condition is that the maker of the confession and the co-accused should necessarily have been tried jointly for the same offence.  In other words, if the co-acused is tried for some other offence, though in the same trial, the confession made by one is not usable against the co-accused.  Third condition is that the confession made by one accused should affect himself as well as the co-accused.  In other words, if the confessor absolves himself from the offence but only involves the co-accused in the crime while making the confession, such a confession cannot be used against the co-accused.\n\nEven if no conditions are satisfied the use of a confession as against a co-accused is only for a very limited purpose i.e. the same can be taken into consideration as against such other person.  It is now well settled that under Section 30 of the Evidence Act the confession made by one accused is not substantive evidence against a co-accused.  It has only a corroborative value.\n\nA confession made admissible under Section 15 of the TADA can be used as against a co-accused only in the same manner and subject to the same conditions as stipulated in Section 30 of the Evidence Act.\n\nIn view of the above legal position the confession made by A1 (Subhas Singh Thakur), A2 (Jayanendra Thakur) and A3 (Shyam Kishore Garikapti) cannot be used against A4 (Chanderkant Patil), even as for corroborative purpose because the former set of acused were not tried for the offence under Section 3(4) of TADA.  So the first condition set forth in Section 30 of the Evidence Act is non-existent.  Though under Section 15 of TADA such a confession is admissible in evidence even when the confessor and the co-accused are tried in the same case (no matter that they are not tried together for the same offence) the utility of such a confession as against the co-accused gets substantially impaired for all practical purposes unless both of them are tried for the same offence.  Consequently in the present trial the confessions made by the first three accused would remain at bay so far as A4 (Chanderkant Patil) is concerned as for Section 3(4) of TADA.  The further corrollary is since there is no substantive evidence against A4 regarding Section 3(4) of TADA he cannot be convicted under this Section.  [Para 75,76,77,78,79]"

(iii) In regard to the use of such confession as against a co-accused, it has to be held that as a matter of caution, a general corroboration should be sought for but in cases where the Court is satisfied that the probative value of such confession is such that it does not require corroboration then it may base a conviction on the basis of such confession of the co-accused without corroboration. But this is an exception to the general rule of requiring corroboration when such confession is to be used against a co-accused. (iv) The nature of corroboration required both in regard to the use of confession against the maker as also in regard to the use of the same against a co-accused is of general nature, unless the Court comes to the conclusion that such corroboration should be on material facts also because of the facts of a particular case.

                ],
                "description": "Penal Code (1860), Ss.141, 149 - Terrorist activities - Unlawful assembly - Police received information about assemblage of extremists in a village with arms and ammunition looted from police station - Their plan was to attack their rivals and kill them - On seeing police raiding party, the assembled extremists started firing - Police apprehended some accused - Arms, ammunition, incriminating letters, were seized in search of house where accused assembled - Police official and 3 accused were killed in incident - Plea of accused is that they were not terrorists - Facts and circumstances of case establish common object of unlawful assembly - Plea of accused that assembly was formed for protection from attack by upper caste people not credible - It is evident that accused persons were well prepared to indulge in violent acts - Conviction of accused by trial court proper.\n\nMajor plea which was emphasized related to the question whether Section 149, IPC has any application for fastening the constructive liability on the basis of unlawful acts committed pursuant to the common object by any member of the acts which the members of the unlawful assembly knew to be likely to be committed which is the sine qua non for its operation. The emphasis is on the common object and not on common intention. Mere presence in an unlawful assembly cannot render a person liable unless there was a common object and he shared the same or was actuated by that common object and that object is one of those set out in Section 141. Where common object of an unlawful assembly is not proved, the accused persons cannot be convicted with the help of Section 149. The crucial question to determine is whether the assembly consisted of five or more persons and whether the said persons entertained one or more of the common objects, as specified in Section 141. It cannot be laid down as a general proposition of law that unless the commission of an overt act is proved against a person, who is alleged to be a member of unlawful assembly, it cannot be said that he is a member of an assembly. The only thing required is that he should have understood that the assembly was unlawful and was likely to commit any of   the acts which fall within the purview of Section 141. The word 'object' means the purpose or design and, in order to make it 'common', it must be shared by all. In other words, the object should be common to the persons, who compose the assembly, that is to say, they should all be aware of it and concur in it. A common object may be formed by express agreement after mutual consultation, but that is by no means always necessary. It may be formed at any stage by all or a few members of the assembly and the other members may just join and adopt it. Once formed, it need not continue to be the same. It may be modified or altered or abandoned at any stage. The expression 'in prosecution of common object' as appearing in Section 149 have to be strictly construed as equivalent to 'in order to attain the common object'. It must be immediately connected with the common object by virtue of the nature of the object. There must be community of object and the object may exist only up to a particular stage, and not thereafter. Members of an unlawful assembly may have community of object up to certain point beyond which they may differ in their  objects and the knowledge, possessed by each member of what is likely to be committed in prosecution of their common object may vary not only according to the information at his command, but also according to the extent to which he shares the community of object, and as a consequence of this the effect of Section 149, IPC  may also vary on different members of the same assembly.  [Para 11]\n\nWhen the factual scenario is considered in the background of the legal position enumerated above, the inevitable conclusion is that Section 149 has been rightly applied. The fact that the unlawful assembly's common object was to resist the enforcement of law, and to commit criminal offences and to overawe the authorities/public servants by use and show of criminal force stood firmly established on the evidence on record. Consequently, the criminal acts committed in furtherance of the common object, which acts were not only part of the common object of the unlawful assembly but also such which the members of the assembly knew reasonably well are such as are likely to be committed squarely attract Section 149 I.P.C. Certain salient factual aspects clearly establish prosecution version. Firstly, defence plea regarding alleged apprehended attack by higher caste people has been found to be of no substance. If really the accused persons had gathered for reaping singada as claimed, there was no reason for the call to be given to start shooting at the police and then actual firing. A person who apprehends attack from some other person would rather welcome the arrival of the police and bring to notice of the officials about the apprehended danger and not to start firing at the police officials knowing them to be police, with defiance adopting a violent posture. This itself is sufficient to discard the defence version about nature and object of assembly. Further, the materials seized show that the object of the assembly was preparation for commission of crime. The presence of huge quantity of arms and that too sophisticated arms unerringly shows the nature of the assembly was unlawful. One of the printed materials i.e., literatures seized clearly indicates their involvement in nature and type of activities which were envisaged in and covered by Section 3(1) of the TADA Act. The plea that place of occurrence was different and was near pond where singadas were grown is also without substance. The dead bodies of the 3 persons who fired at the police officials were found in the house said to belong to the acquitted accused and the dead body of the deceased was also nearby. The evidence of the injured police officials is also relevant, and there is no reason as to why they would falsely implicate the accused persons. It is not correct as submitted by the learned Counsel for the appellants that none of the persons who were arrested were carrying arms. In fact, some of the prosecution witnesses have stated that they were also carrying arms, and this evidence has not been successfully rebutted. \t [Para 15]"

That statement is also substantive evidence against his co-accused. Against the co-accused, though taken as substantive evidence as a rule of prudence, to get support, the Court would look upon corroborative evidence as well.  [Para 19]\n\nThus, the fate of not only the accused but the co-accused as well hinges on the confessional statement recorded by a Police officer under section 15 of the TADA Act. Such a statement cannot be recorded in a mechanical manner. All the safeguards provided in the Act and the Rules have to be strictly adhered to. There can be no room for any latitude in the matter and manner of recording of a confessional statement. Any material discrepancy will be fatal unless satisfactorily explained by the prosecution. The burden of proving confessional statements always remains on the prosecution. It is for the prosecution to prove that the confessional statement that is being relied upon was voluntary, truthful and all safeguards were complied with while recording it. The burden of proving such confessional statement on the prosecution cannot be lightened by urging that the confession was not retracted or challenged except in the cross-examination of the witnesses. Undoubtedly, when the confession is duly recorded and is proved to be voluntary and truthful, then it can be taken to be the most reliable piece of evidence coming from the accused himself and made sole basis of conviction, confession being an admission of the guilt.

It is such that the fate of not only the accused but co-accused, abettor and conspirator depends upon it. It can result in the hanging of accused and co-accused etc. Relying on it, punishment up to death penalty can be imposed on the maker as also on others.  [Para 32]\n\nThe contemporaneous record has to support the deposition in Court. If the recording officer without contemporaneous record is allowed to depose later after lapse of several years in Court, it would be too hazardous to rely on such testimony as, ordinarily, an officer is likely to depose in Court what was left out to be recorded in documents as per mandatory provisions of the Act and the Rules, once he knows that he had made vital omission. If the contemporaneous record shows that in substance though not in form, the requirements of the Rule were fulfilled, the defect of form can be cured by oral deposition made, may be after many years, on the basis of the contemporaneous record.  [Para 37]\n\nTo conclude : A.\tWriting the certificate and making the memorandum under Rule 15(3)(b) is mandatory.\n\nB.\tThe language of the certificate and the memorandum is not mandatory.\n\nC.\tIn case the certificate and memorandum is not prepared but the contemporaneous record shows substantial compliance of what is required to be contained therein, the discrepancy can be cured if there is oral evidence of recording officer based on such contemporaneous record.\n\nD.\tIn absence of contemporaneous record, discrepancy cannot be cured by oral evidence based on memory of the recording officer. \n\nIn the present case, admittedly Rule 15(3)(b) has not been complied. No memorandum as required was made. There is also no contemporaneous record to show the satisfaction of the recording officer after writing of confession that the confession has been voluntarily made. The confession of accused No. 7 does not even state that it was read over to him. Thus, confessional statements are inadmissible and cannot be made basis of upholding the conviction."

The two provisions operate in different and independent fields. The basis for grant of bail under S. 20(4), is entirely different from the grounds on which bail may be granted under S. 20(8) of the Act. Plain phraseology of sub-sec. (8) of S. 20 shows that it commences with a non-abstante clause and in its operation imposes a ban on release of a person accused of an offence punishable under TADA or any rule made thereunder on bail unless the twin conditions contained in Cls. (a) and (b) thereof are satisfied. No bail can be granted under S. 20(8) unless the Designated Court is satisfied after notice to the public prosecutor that there are reasonable grounds for beliving that the accused is not guilty of such an offence and that he is not likely to commit any offence while on bail. Sub-sec. (9) qualifies sub-sec. (8) to the extent that the two conditions contained, in Cls (a) and (b) are in addition to the limitations prescribed under the Code of Criminal Procedure or any other law for the time being in force relating to the grant of bail. S. 20(8) is not the source of power of the Designated Court to grant bail but it places further limitations on the exercise of its power to grant bail in cases under TADA, as is amply clear from the plain language of Section 20(9).\n\nOn the other hand an application for grant of bail under S. 20(4) has to be decided on its own merits for the default of the prosecuting agency to file the charge sheet within the prescribed or the extended period for completion of the investigation uninfluenced by the merits or the gravity of the case. The Court has no power to remand an accused to custody beyond the period prescribed by Cl. (b) of S. 20(4) or extended under Cl. (bb) of the said section, as the case may be, if the challan is not filed only on the ground that the accusation against the accused is of a serious nature or the offence is very grave. These grounds are irrelevant for considering the grant of bail under S.20(4) of TADA.     [Para 21]"

Hospital shoot out case - Terrorist Act - Terrorism cannot be defined in precise words - Would depend on facts and circumstances of each case - Direct evidence would be difficult to find - Nature of fall out of violent act would also differ from person to person.\n\nIt is not possible to define 'terrorism' by precise words. Whether the act was committed with intent to strike terror in the people or a section of the people would depend upon facts of each case. Further, for finding out intention of the accused, there would hardly be a few cases where there could be direct evidence. Mainly it is to be inferred from the circumstances of each case. In appropriate cases, from the nature of violent act. Inference can be culled out. There can also be no doubt that fall out of violent act vary from person to person and society to society but is well understood by a prudent person and by those who are affected. [Para 45]\n\nIn the present case the prosecution version as revealed from the confessional statements and other evidence is that there are two gangs operating in Mumbai i.e. one of Dawood Ibrahim and other of Arun Gavli. Their activities are of eliminating or causing harm or injury to those who do not obey their dictates and of extortion from builders, hoteliers, industrialists, professionals and other persons. They also indulge in smuggling and drug trafficking and for undertaking all these activities in organized manner, they employ number of persons. Their code word for such activities is 'game'. May be that they are getting some support from the authorities or politicians and a vice versa. Not only this, it would be totally unjust to ignore the ground reality that these terrorist gangs operate and extort large amount of money. Through terrorism, they acquire or maintain power or control by intimidation and causing fear and helplessness in the minds of the people at large They are hardened criminals and take advantage of the situation and in many cases, police authorities fail to protect victims. As confessed by A-2 Suryarao, President of Bhiwandi Municipal Corporation, he sought assistance from A-7 and others and thereafter it is his say that he was required to comply with the illegal demand of A-7 of rendering assistance to A-6 and A-7 after commission of the offence. Further, the intention of the accused could be gathered from their act of shooting the police guards who were on duty and causing injury to others whosoever came in their way. In such a situation, it could be inferred that the dastardly act was to administer a terror or a shock wave in the people at large and convey that the fate of all those who did not obey their dictates or oppose them would be the same as that of Shailesh Haldankar. It further conveys that police guard on duty cannot save the victim, but they also may meet the same fate. Not only this, the crime was perpetuated in a protected place i.e. J.J. Hospital by master-minding the operation of achieving the target. Necessary information was collected and after equipping themselves with sophisticated weapons they went to the hospital where patients and staff on duty went helter-skelter, witnesses turned hostile.  PW 42 PSI Thakur who was police officer on duty could not do anything to protect anyone and after giving detailed FIR failed to support the same before the Court. How the witnesses are terrorized can be seen from the evidence of PW42, who had lodged the FIR. He resigned from the post and was suffering mental depression and spending sleepless nights and was much more worried because of the incident about the safety of his family. At the time of giving evidence, he was feeling tense even after lapse of seven years of the incident. Similar was the position of PW 54 Shankar Ramchandra Jadhav. Further, PW 28 Shrirang Gangaram Uttekar (hostile witness) a watchman at the gate of J.J. Hospital was so scared that in the cross-examination, when he was asked about accused No. 10. Court noted \"the witness appears to be scared and started looking to the Court and turning his eyes in various directions\". The Special Judge also observed that, \"from the appearance, the witness appears to be scared and attempt was made to make him easy but attempt failed and finally witness started weeping in the witness box\". Further, confession by A-2 reveals how the persons in clutches of these gangs are terrorized. Hence, there is no substance in the contention of the learned counsel for the accused that there was no intention on the part of the accused to strike terror and that the crime would not be covered by the terrorist activity as provided under Section 3(1) of TADA. We would again reiterate that whether the crime committed creates terror or not, depends upon the facts and circumstances of each case and cannot be defined by precise words.\t [Para 46]"

The police officer before recording the confession has to observe the requirement of sub-section (2) of Section 15 irregularities here and there would not make such confessional statement inadmissible in evidence. If the Legislature in its wisdom has provided after considering the situation prevailing in the society that such confessional statement can be used as evidence, it would not be just, reasonable and prudent to water down the scheme of the Act on the assumption that the said statement was recorded under duress or was not recorded truly by the concerned officer in whom faith is reposed. It is true that there may be some cases where the power is misused by the concerned authority. But such contention can be raised in almost all cases and it would be for the Court to decide to what extent the said statement is to be used ideal goal may be :- confessional statement is made by the accused as repentance for his crime but for achieving such ideal goal there must be altogether different atmosphere in the society. Hence, unless a fool-proof method is evolved by the society or such atmosphere is created, there is no alternative, but to implement the law as it is. \t\t\t [Para 59]"

Supposing a law is made which makes an act committed by a person a crime on one day, but the same law says that the same act will not be a crime if committed on the next day.  Surely such a law will be violative of Article 14 unless there is very strong and rational basis for such classification and differentiation. From the common sense point of view too, it does not stand to reason that certain act will be treated as a crime if committed within one time period, but it will not be a crime if it is committed thereafter. Of course, if there is good rational ground for making such a differentiation, Article 14 may not be violated but then it will be for the State Authorities to justify such a classification on some reasonable and rational basis, failing which it will clearly violate Article 14 of the Constitution.   [Para 25,26,27]\n\nIn the present case, Section 1(4) of the Act says that the offence created by Section 3 of the Act will be punishable as a crime if the act was committed on or before 24-5-1995, but if the same act was committed after 24-5-1995, it will not be a crime. This is ex facie violation of Article 14 of the Constitution and hence Section 1(4) of Act to the extent it says that acts mentioned in Section 3 committed on or before 24-5-1995 can still be treated as a crime and punished under the TADA, though the same act committed after 24-5-1995 cannot, is clearly ultra vires Article 14 and hence is liable to be struck down as unconstitutional.\n [Para 28]"

Whether such confession requires corroboration depends on the facts of the given case. If the Court is convinced that the probative value of the confession is such that it does not require corroboration then the same can be used for convicting the maker and/or co-accused under the Act and/or other enactments without independent corroboration. If a person accused of committing an offence under the Act challenges his confession on the ground that it was not made voluntarily, then the initial burden is on the prosecution to prove that all requirements under Section 15 of the Act and Rule 15 of the Rules have been complied with. Once this is done, the burden shifts on the accused person and it is for him to prove that the confession was not made voluntarily or that the same is not truthful and if he adduces evidence during the trial to substantiate his allegation that the confession was not voluntary then the Court has to carefully scrutinize the entire evidence and surrounding circumstances and determine whether or not the confession was voluntary. The confession made under Section 15 of the Act cannot be discarded only on the ground of violation of the guidelines laid down in Kartar Singh's case reported in 1994(3) SCC 569 because the same have not been incorporated in the Act and/or the Rules.\n\nIn the present case, before recording confessions of appellant Nos.A-4 to A-8 and A-10, the two officers viz. Shri. A.K. Majumdar and Shri. Harbhajan Ram explained to each of them separately that he is not bound to make confession and that if he does so, the same may be used as evidence against him. The concerned officers also recorded their satisfaction that the appellants were making confessions voluntarily and that no threat or allurement was given to any of them and nobody had coerced them to make confession. Each of the six appellants was given time to think on the issue of making confession and having felt convinced that they were doing so out of their volition, the officers recorded their statements. The confessions of six appellants were typed by the stenographer on Hindi typewriter. The same were read over to the accused who admitted that the recording contains full and true account of his statement and then signed it. The officers also recorded their observations about voluntary character of the confessions and then singed the same. The statements of the six appellants were immediately sent to Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Delhi for onward transmission to the Designated Court at Ahmedabad. All this shows that there was total compliance of Section 15 of the Act and Rule 15 of the Rules.  1994(3) SCC 569 - Ref.to.   [Para 27,42]"

Any confession made in defiance of the safeguards provided therein, would not be relied upon by a court.  The confession should be made voluntarily without there being any force or pressure put on, or allurement or inducement given to, a person who is voluntarily admitting his guilt.  Under Section 25 of the Indian Evidence Act, a confession made to the police officer is not admissible in evidence to be considered by a court.  Although there are certain exceptions in the preceding provisions, but the fact remains that as a rule a confession made to the police officer is not made admissible under the Evidence Act.  The idea appears to be that any statement made to a police officer who is connected with the investigation and prosecution of a person, would not be taken as evidence.  Under Section 15 of the TADA Act, if a confession made by the accused to a police officer not lower than the rank of Superintendent of Police is made admissible, it would still be a confession made to the police officer, and thus inbuilt safeguards have been provided under Section 15 of the TADA Act read with Rule 15 of the TADA Rules so as to lend credence to the confession made to the police officer, it being voluntarily and without any force or pressure and allurement or inducement.\n\nIt is necessary for the police officer to certify that he has explained to the accused that the accused is not bound to make a confession and if he does so such confession may be used as evidence against him.  It is further required to be recorded that he believes that the confession was voluntarily made.  He has to record that the confessional statement has been taken in his presence and hearing and recorded by him.  The confessional statement should be read over to the person making it and admitted by him to be correct and it should be certified that it contains a full and true account of the statement made by the accused.  The certificate which is required to be given by the police officer is not a mere formality, but it is for the purposes of ascertaining that the police officer has recorded the confession keeping in mind and being fully aware of the fact that the confession recorded by him is a voluntary confession and with the information available to the accused that he is not bound to make such confession and if he does so it will be used as evidence against him.  A duty is cast on the police officer who is to record the confession to bring at the relevant time these facts to the notice of the person whose confession is going to be recorded. 2004 ALL MR (Cri) 3428 (S.C.) and 2004 ALL MR (Cri) 1171 (S.C.) - Ref. to.\t [Para 49,50]"

Confession to a police officer is inadmissible vide Section 25 of the Evidence Act, but it is admissible in TADA cases vide Section 15 of the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987. Confession is a very weak kind of evidence. As is well known, the wide spread and rampant practice in the police in India is to use third degree methods for extracting confessions from the alleged accused. Hence, the courts have to be cautious in accepting confessions made to the police by the alleged accused. Unfortunately, the police in our country are not trained in scientific investigation (as is the police in Western countries) nor are they provided the technical equipments for scientific investigation, hence to obtain a conviction they often rely on the easy short cut of procuring a confession under torture. Torture is such a terrible thing that when a person is under torture he will confess to almost any crime. Even Joan of Arc confessed to be a witch under torture. Hence, where the prosecution case mainly rests on the confessional statement made to the police by the alleged accused, in the absence of corroborative material, the courts must be hesitant before they accept such extra-judicial confessional statements. In the instant case, the prosecution case mainly relies on the alleged confessional statement of the appellant made before the Superintendent of Police, which is an extra-judicial confession and there is absence of corroborative material. Therefore, it will not be safe to convict the accused on the basis of alleged confessional statement. 2011 ALL SCR 357 - Ref. of.\t\t [Para 4,9]"

The person who is alleged to be involved in a terrorist act can be charged under Section 3(1) only when the prosecution has been successful in establishing that the same was committed with the intent to awe the government or to achieve one or the other ends mentioned under Section 3(1). There is a distinction between the incidence of terror as a consequence of a particular act and causing terror being the sole intent of the same act. It is only in case of the latter that the provisions of Section 3(1) are attracted.  (1994)4 SCC 602 - Rel.on.  [Para 85]\n\nThe prosecution in this case has argued that charge under Section 3 is maintainable in the light of the Bombay bomb blasts and the fact that deceased would have been pivotal in providing information regarding the smuggling of arms and explosives. The prosecution has not been successful in proving that this particular murder was committed with the intention to cause terror. As mentioned earlier, terror could have been caused as a consequence of the act. The prosecution has stated that the main intention behind the murder of deceased was to prevent the names of persons involved in smuggling of arms and explosives would not come to light during the investigations that followed the Bombay blast. It is therefore evident that the intention of the accused in the present case was not to cause terror but to prevent information regarding another crime from being divulged. In the light of these facts, the TADA Court was justified in dismissing the charges framed under the TADA Act.   [Para 88]"

Section 15 and the rules made thereunder prescribe certain guidelines - which if ensured can, to a large extent, point towards the fact that the confession is truthful and voluntary. However, we must not overlook the fact that the TADA prescribes a deviation from the conventional criminal jurisprudence. As a court of record, we are bound to keep in mind situations where despite the procedure being followed, the testimony so obtained under Section 15 is coloured by suspicion and doubt regarding its veracity. Hence, albeit the procedure is followed, we find it judicious to look into whether the testimony is corroborated by the evidence presented by the prosecution. The life and liberty of a person are at stake and no effort should be spared in such circumstances to see that justice is done.  [Para 73,75,77]"

Thomas, J. :- It is not possible to hold that the conspirators ever entertained an intention to strike terror in people or any section thereof. The mere fact that their action resulted in the killing of 18 persons which would have struck great terror in the people of India has been projected as evidence that they intended to strike terror in people. We have no doubt that the aftermath of the carnage at Sriperumbudur had bubbled up waves of shock and terror throughout India. But there is absolutely no evidence that any one of the conspirators ever desired the death of any Indian other than Rajiv Gandhi. Among the series of confessions made by a record number of accused in any single case, as in this case, not even one of them has stated that anybody had the desire or intention to murder one more person along with Rajiv Gandhi except perhaps the murderer herself. Of course they should have anticipated that in such a dastardly action more lives would be vulnerable to peril. But that is a different matter and we cannot attribute an intention of the conspirators to kill anyone other than Rajiv Gandhi and the contemporaneous destruction of the killer also.\n\nAlternatively, even if Sivarasan and the top brass of LTTE knew that there was likelihood of more casualties that cannot be equated to a situation that they did it with an intention to strike terror in any section of the people.\n\nIn view of the paucity of materials to prove that the conspirators intended to overawe the Government of India or to strike. terror in the people of India we are unable to sustain the conviction of offences under Section 3 of TADA.  [Para 62,63,64]\n\nPer S.S.M. Quadri, J:- Section 3(1) embodies the principle expressed in the maxim 'actus non facit reumnisi mens sit rea;' both 'mens rea' and a criminal act are the ingredients of the definition of 'Terrorist Act'.  The mens rea required is the intention (i) to overawe  the Government as by law established; or (ii) to strike terror in the people or any section of the people; or (iii) to alienate any section of the people; or (iv) to adversely affect the harmony amongst different sections of the people.

Such actions include advocating, advising, suggesting, inciting, predicting, prophesying, pronouncing or prompting the killing of such persons.\n\nIn other words, all the preceding actions directed positively towards killing of such persons would amount to disruptive activity, but not the final result namely, the act of killing of such person.

Thomas, J:- The attempt which prosecution has made in that regard, is to show that the conspirators intended to disrupt the sovereignty of India. To support the said contention, our attention was drawn to the confessional statement of A-3 (Murugan), A-18 (Arivu) and the photographs proved as M.O.s. 256 to 259 which were seized from the bag of A-3 (Murugan). The said items of evidence show that photos of Fort St. George, Madras (which houses the Government Secretariat of Tamil Nadu and the Legislative Assembly and Legislative Council), Police Headquarters, Central Jail within Vellore Fort etc. had been taken and despatched to the LTTE top brass of Sri Lanka.\n\nIt is too much a strain to enter a finding, on such evidence, that the above activities were unmistakably aimed at disrupting the sovereignty of India. The sketch of Vellore Fort (which houses the Central Jail) was drawn up, most probably, for planning some operation to rescue the prisoners (belonging to LTTE who have been interned therein). That of course would be an offence but not an activity which falls within the purview of Section 4 of TADA.  [Para 73,74]"

L.J. 382 (Bombay) and AIR 1937 Nagpur 220 overruled.\n\nCriminal P.C. (1973), Ss.164, 463.\n\nPer K.T. Thomas, J.:- All the first 16 pages contain the signatures of A-1 (Nalini) but the last two pages don't have the signatures. The requirement that confessional statement shall be signed by the maker has been substantially complied with despite the slip in obtaining the signature in the last two pages. According to PW-52  the Superintendent of Police who recorded it, the said slip was an inadvertent omission. But that omission does not  mean  that  a confession was not signed  by her at all. The certificate which is required by Rule 15(3) has also been made at the foot of Ext. P-77, but that happened to be made on one of the two pages where the signature of A-1 is absent.\n\nOn the facts we are not persuaded to uphold the contention that Rule 15(3) has not been complied with. That apart, even if there was such an omission the question is whether it would  have injured the accused  in  her defence.    Section 463 of  the Code   permits such an approach to be made in regard to the omissions in recording the confession under Section 164 of the Code. That approach can be adopted in respect of the confession recorded under Section 15 of the TADA as well. The resultant position is that the said omission need not be countenanced since it was  not shown that the omission has caused any harm to the accused.  [Para 128,129]\n\nThe certificate as required by Rule 15(3) of TADA Rules in the form prescribed has been appended by S.P., at the end of the confession.  Signatures of Nalini appear on pages 1 to 16.  In his testimony S.P. has submitted that his not getting signature of Nalini at the end of confession is an omission. There is no cross-examination of S.P. as to why the omission occurred. It has not been suggested that the omission was deliberate. Statement of S.P. is forthright. There could certainly be a human error but that would not mean that S. 463 of the Code becomes inapplicable. Mr. Natarajan is correct in his submission that when the requirement of law is that confession should be signed by the person making it, it would mean his signatures at the end of the confession. What S. 463 requires is that evidence could be led of police officer recording the confession as to why provisions of Rule 15(3) could not be complied while recording the confession. It has not been suggested or brought on record as to how not getting signatures of Nalini on the last pages of the confession has injured her in her defence on the merits of the case. The confession has been corroborated in material particulars by means of independent evidence even if the confessions of the co-accused are set apart. Confession of Nalini was recorded on 7-8-1991 and was sent to the Court of the Chief Judicial Magistrate on the following day and on 9-8-1991 it was sent to the Designated Court. We find that the confession was duly made, which was recorded by S.P.  We are, therefore, inclined to admit the confession of Nalini overruling the objection that Rule 15(3) of the TADA Rules has been violated.  [Para 404]\n\nPer S.S.M. Quadri, J.:- An analysis of sub-section (1) of Section 15 shows that it has two limbs. The first limb bars application of provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Indian Evidence Act to a confession made by a person before a police officer not lower in rank than a Superintendent of Police and recorded by him in any of the modes noted in the section. The second limb makes such a confession admissible, de hors the provisions of the Evidence Act in the trial of such person or co-accused, abettor or  conspirator for an offence under the TADA Act or rules made thereunder provided the co-accused, abettor or conspirator is charged and tried in the same case together with the accused. The import of Section 15(1) is that insofar as the provisions of the Cr. P.C. and the Evidence Act come in conflict with either recording of a confession of a person by a police officer of the rank mentioned therein, in any of the modes specified in the section, or its admissibility at the trial, they will have to yield to the provisions of Section 15(1) of the TADA Act as it is given overriding effect.\n\nThus, Sections 162, 164, 281 and 463 of the Code of Criminal Procedure which have a bearing on the question of recording of statement/confession of a person and Sections 24 to 30 of the Evidence Act which deal with various aspects of confession of an accused stand excluded vis-a-vis Section 15(1) of the TADA Act and cannot be called in aid to invalidate recording of confession of an accused by a police officer of the specified rank and/or its admissibility in the trial of the co-accused,  abettor or conspirator charged and tried in the same case together with the accused for an offence under the TADA Act or rules made thereunder. It must be made clear that the non obstante  clause in Section 15(1) of the TADA Act does not exclude the application of all the provisions of the Cr. P.C. and the Indian Evidence Act in the trial of offences under TADA Act.  [Para 667,668]"

[Para 85]\n\nPer D.P. Wadhwa, J.:-  It is apparent that provisions of S.12 of TADA were not brought to the notice of the Court in Bilal Ahmed Kaloo's case.  This Judgment which was rendered by two learned Judges of this Court, does not lay a good law on this aspect of the matter. (1997)7 SCC 431.  [Para 409]\n\nPer S.S.M. Quadri, J.:- A perusal of the judgment in Kaloo's case shows that Section 12 of the TADA Act was not brought to the notice of this Court and moreover the point was conceded by the learned counsel for the State.  I concur with my learned brethren that Kaloo's case does not lay down the correct law.  It follows that confessions recorded under Section 15 of the TADA Act and admitted in the trial of offences under the TADA Act and under Section 120-B read with Section 302, I.P.C. can be relied upon to record conviction of the applicants for the said offences under I.P.C. even though they are acquitted of offences under the TADA Act.

Thomas J. dissenting)\n\nEvidence Act (1872), S.30.\n\nPer D.P. Wadhwa, J and S.S.M. Quadri, J concurring :-\tThe confessions of the accused in the present case were voluntarily and validly made and under Section 15 of Tada confession of an accused is admissible against co-accused as a substantive evidence.  Substantive evidence, however, does not necessarily mean substantial evidence.  It is the quality of evidence that matters.   As to what value is to be attached to a confession will fall within the domain of appreciation of evidence.  As a matter of prudence Court may look for some corroboration if confession is to be used against a co-accused though that will again be with in the sphere of appraisal of evidence.  [Para 423]\n\nTADA was enacted to meet extraordinary situation existing in the country.  Its departure from the law relating to confession as contained in Evidence Act is deliberate.  Law has to respond to the reality of the situation.  What is admissible is the evidence.  Confession of the accused is admissible with the same force in its application to the co-accused who is tried in the same case.  It is primary evidence and not corroborative.  When the Legislature enacts that Evidence Act would not apply which would mean all the provisions of the Evidence Act including S.30.  By judicial interpretation or judicial rigmarole, as we may put it, the Court cannot again bring into operation S.30 of the Evidence Act and any such attempt would not appear to be quite warranted.  [Para 420]\n\n1998 ALL MR (Cri) 240 (S.C.) Held needs reconsideration.  [Para 420]\n\nPer S.S.M. Quadri, J.:- If the expression 'substantive evidence' is understood in the sense of evidence of a fact in issue or a relevant fact and not proof of what it contains and that it has to be evaluated by the Court like any other category of evidence no difficulty arises. The difficulty will, however, arise if 'substantive evidence' is equated with the position flowing from the application of legislative mandate by incorporating 'shall presume' as Brother Thomas, J. has indicated in his judgment as that will, in my view, nullify the effect of legal presumption in S. 21(1) of the TADA Act. I, therefore, respectfully differ from the view taken by the Bench in Kalpnath Rai's case (1998 ALL MR (Cri) 240 (S.C.) and brother Thomas, J. in his judgment in this case and in respectful agreement with the view expressed by brother Wadhwa. J. in his  judgment that a confession of an accused under S. 15(1) of the TADA Act is substantive evidence against the co-accused, abettor or conspirator jointly tried with the accused.  [Para 697]\n\nPer K.T. Thomas, J. (Dissenting) :- While a confession is substantive evidence against its maker it cannot be used as substantive evidence against another person even if the latter is a co-accused, but it can be used as a piece of corroborative material to support other substantive evidence. The non obstante words in Section 15(1) of TADA are not intended to make it substantive evidence against the non-maker, particularly after amendments were brought about in the sub-section through Act 43 of 1993.

Smelling doubts for the sake of giving benefit of doubt is not the law of the land. In such type of terrorist activities if arms and ammunitions are recovered at the instance of or on disclosure by accused, it can be stated that presumption of innocence would not thereafter exist and it would be for the accused to explain its possession or discovery or recovery and would depend upon facts of each case which are to be appreciated on the scales of common sense of a prudent man possessing capacity to \"separate the chaff from grain\". In such cases, as stated by Lord Denning J, law would fail to protect the community if it admitted fanciful possibilities to deflect the course of justice. If it is established on record that co-accused was found in company of accused at Aligarh and that at Bombay also he had introduced himself as friend of accused to PW87, his childhood friend, then it would be reasonable to infer accused was co-conspirator and assisting, as stated in his confessional statement.

It forbids recording of information about the commission of offences under TADA by the Police without the prior approval of the District Superintendent of Police. The question is whether the power of approval vested in the District Superintendent of Police could be exercised by either the Government or the Additional Police Commissioner, Surat in the instant case. Answer to that question is in the negative. The reasons are not far to seek. Firstly because the statute vests the grant of approval in an authority specifically designated for the purpose. That being so, no one except the authority so designated, can exercise that power. Permitting exercise of the power by any other authority whether superior or inferior to the authority designated by the Statute will have the effect of re-writing the provision and defeating the legislature purpose behind the same - a course that is legally impermissible. Secondly, because exercise of the power vested in the District Superintendent of Police under Section 20-A (1) would involve application of mind by the officer concerned to the material placed before him on the basis whereof, alone a decision whether or not information regarding commission of an offence under TADA should be recorded can be taken. Exercise of the power granting or refusing approval under Section 20-A (1) in its very nature casts a duty upon the officer concerned to evaluate the information and determine having regard to all attendant circumstances whether or not a case for invoking the provisions of TADA is made out. Exercise of that power by anyone other than the designated authority viz. the District Superintendent of Police would amount to such other authority clutching at the jurisdiction of the designated officer, no matter such officer or authority purporting to exercise that power is superior in rank and position to the officer authorised by law to take the decision. Thirdly, because if the Statute provides for a thing to be done in a particular manner, then it must be done in that manner alone. All other modes or methods of doing that thing must be deemed to have been prohibited.\n\n(2011) 5 SCC 435 Ref. to.\n\nAIR 1954 SC 322, AIR 1964 SC 358, 1999 (8) SC 266, 2001 ALL MR (Cri) 1265 (S.C.), 2008 (4) SCC 755 Rel. on.

A combined reading of Sections 8 and 19 of the Act and Section 84(4) of the Code makes it abundantly clear that the person not being a proclaimed offender against whom an order is passed under Section 8 of the Act read with Section 84 of the Code has the remedy of filing a suit which reflects the intention of the Legislature to treat the order of the Designated Court, in so far as it affects the third party claimant, to be an interlocutory order.  Such an order would, however, be deemed to be a final order so far as the prosecution, the State and the proclaimed offender are concerned particularly in view of the provisions of Section 86 of the Code.  Interlocutory order in law means, not that which decides the cause but which only settles intervening matter relating to the cause.  Such an order is made pending the cause and before the final hearing on the merits.  It is made to secure some end and purpose necessary and essential to the progress of the case and generally collateral to the issues to be settled by the Court in the final judgment.  Orders summoning witnesses, adjourning cases, passing orders for bail, calling for reports, attaching the properties (with the exception of Section 86) and such other steps in the aid of pending proceedings shall amount to be interlocutory orders against which no appeal can be preferred with the aid of Section 19 of the Act.  As the order attaching the property in so far as relates to the claimant third party, is subject to the decision of the Civil Court, it cannot be held to be a final order.  [Para 6]\n\nUpon a harmonious intepretation of the various provisions of the Act and the Code, there is no escape from the position that the order passed by the Designated Court under Section 84 of the Code in so far as it relates to the third party rights of the claimant is only an interlocutory order and not final orders for which an appeal could be filed under Section 19 of the Act.  But if such aggrieved claimant does not choose to challenge the order by way of a suit, such order would become final so far as the State is concerned.  It may be noted in this context that a suit can be filed only at the instance of the person whose claims or objections are disallowed. Hence, when the claims or objections are upheld the aggrieved party can avail himself of the remedy under Section 19 of the Act.\t\t [Para 7]"

There was absolutely no necessity in re-stating in the notification that the Board shall have all the powers which the Telegraph Authority possesses under the Indian Telegraph Act for placing of any wires, poles, wall-brackets, stays, apparatus and appliances for the transmission and distribution of electricity when the notification states that the Board shall exercise all the powers of Telegraph Authority vested in it as provided under section 42 of the said Act. The notification, therefore, clearly empowers the Board, its officers, servants and agents to exercise all the powers of Telegraph Authority under the Indian Telegraph Act for execution of the scheme which has been sanctioned and, therefore, the provisions of sections 12 to 19 of the Indian Electricity Act would not apply. The Courts below, therefore, seriously erred in holding that in the notification published under section 28(3), the Board has not been empowered with the powers of Telegraph Authority under the Indian Telegraph Act and that the provisions of sections 12 to 19 of the Indian Electricity Act were required to be followed.  [Para 11]\n\nThere can be no doubt that laying of electric supply lines is of utmost importance, need of hour and life and blood of progress and development and the said process cannot be allowed to be blocked on technical grounds. In the present case, the notification dated 30-10-1986 means that the Board exercises the powers of Telegraph Authority in execution of the scheme, and, therefore, there is no impediment for the Board and its officials to exercise the powers of the Telegraph Authority possessed under Part III of Indian Telegraph Act and do all such acts necessary for execution of the Scheme.

By section 14(13) MCOCA provides for overriding the provisions of the Cr.P.C. or any law for the time being in force which would include the Indian Telegraph Act.  Similar effect given by section 25 by laying down that anything inconsistent contained in any law for the time being in force with the provisions of MCOCA would be overridden by the provisions of section 25.  In effect the protection included in the provisions of section 5(2) of the Indian Telegraph Act and Rule 419-A will be overridden by the provisions of MCOCA.

In spite of that, he received a bill in which S.T.D. calls were shown to have been made from the said telephone. The petitioner had to repeatedly visit the Telephone Department in this connection, assurance was given by the respondent to make necessary adjustment in subsequent bill, but he continued to receive the bills without adjustment. Rebate relating to S.T.D. calls was refused on the ground  that locking facility was not availed of by the petitioner. The matter was referred to the Excess Billing Committee though it was not necessary. The petitioner had to visit the Department on more than 20 occasions, had to waste lot of time, money and energy, in the process had to face threats of disconnection and was pushed around from table to table in the office of the respondent for about 2 1/2 years for a trivial matter.\n\n In the circumstances, the respondent department was directed to pay compensation, costs and expenses to the petitioner. The Department was responsible for delay in settling the complaint and also for harassment of the petitioner. It was an instance of inefficient handling of the matter. There was no sincere desire to sort out the complaints in an effective and expeditious manner. All sorts of excuses were put forward and the matter which should have been sorted out by the Department within reasonable time had taken almost three years. There was no grievance cell which would provide effective and expeditious mechanism to settle the grievances of the consumers within a reasonable time. AIR 1983 Cal. 273 foll.

Apart from the fact that the petitioner invoked Article 32, the nature of the challenge in his petition is very serious in the sense that he is alleging an attempt by the government of intercepting his phone and he is further alleging that in making this attempt the government is acting on extraneous considerations, and is virtually acting in furtherance of the design of the ruling party. It is, therefore, imperative that before making such an allegation the petitioner should be careful, circumspect and file a proper affidavit in support of his averment in the petition. Thus, perfunctory and slipshod affidavits which are not consistent either with Order 19, Rule 3 of the CPC or with Order 11, Rules 5 and 13 of the Supreme Court Rules should not be entertained by the Court. The Supreme Court directed that the Registry must henceforth strictly scrutinize all the affidavits, all petitions and applications and will reject or note as defective all those which are not consistent with the mandate of Order 19, Rule 3 of the CPC and Order 11, Rules 5 and 13 of the Supreme Court Rules. \t [Para 11,12,20,24,65,68]\n\nThe service provider i.e. Telephone Company must immediately act upon such written request but when the communication bristles with gross mistakes, as in the present case, it is the duty of the service provider to simultaneously verify its authenticity while at the same time also act upon it. The Central Government must, therefore, frame certain statutory guidelines in this regard to prevent interception of telephone conversation on unauthorised communication, as has been done in this case.\t [Para 41]\n\nIt is, therefore, clear that writ petition is frivolous and is speculative in character. The so called legal questions on tapping of telephone cannot be gone into on the basis of a petition which is so weak in its foundation. [Para 52,62]"

Section 16 thus contemplates a decision of the District Magistrate to enquire: whether the resistance or obstruction is justified and to direct the further exercise of powers. It also contemplates a decision by the District Judge on the question of compensation. Though the section does not expressly provide for a hearing by the District Magistrate on whether the authority should be permitted to exercise their power in case of resistance or obstruction. There is no doubt that such an order involves civil consequences in that the authority acquires rights of user in the land of a citizen and, therefore, such a decision must be preceded by hearing the one who obstructs.\n\nThus from the scheme of Sections 10 and 16, though a hearing is not contemplated before an electric line is placed in any immovable property, such a hearing is contemplated if there is obstruction or resistance to such placing. Taken separately, no hearing is contemplated under Section 10 and a limited hearing is contemplated under Section 16.

Such terms and conditions obviously include terms and conditions regarding the economic stipulations subject to which either of the parties is willing to be in the contract.      [Para 41]\n\nHowever, the Licensor being the Union of India, its discretion to stipulate terms and conditions is regulated by certain constitutional mandates apart from stipulations of any law applicable. The Licensor/Union of India does not have the freedom to act whimsically. the authority of the Union is fettered by two constitutional limitations; firstly, that any decision of the State to grant access to natural resources, which belong to the people, must ensure that the people are adequately compensated and, secondly, the process by which such access is granted must be just, non-arbitrary and transparent, vis-\u00e0-vis private parties seeking such access.           [Para 42,44]\n\nIt can thus, be seen that no person other than the Government of India has any right to establish, maintain and work telephones. It is the exclusive privilege of the Government of India, which could be permitted to be exercised by others by a grant from the Government of India, Even the language of the proviso to Section 4 of the Telegraph Act, which stipulates that the grant of license should be \"on such conditions and in consideration of such payments as it thinks fit\", must necessarily be understood that the conditions must be rational and the payments forming the consideration for the grant of license must be non-discriminatory. The conditions contained in the licenses in question stipulate that the term of the license could be extended on mutually agreed terms, if the Government of India deems it expedient.      [Para 46]\n\nThe conditions of licences/contracts in whatever language provided for consideration for the extension of a licence are necessarily required to be interpreted in consonance with the obligation of the Licensor/Union of India under the Constitution and the laws. Otherwise, the contract would be rendered void for being inconsistent with public policy, the principle expressly incorporated under Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872.      [Para 52]"

The Plaintiff has made out a dispute as a licencee of the Defendant under the licence dated 22nd January, 1999. The Plaintiff's dispute is with regard to the preponement of monopolisation under the licence. The Plaintiff's dispute is also with regard to the extent and content of the package offered by the Government in consideration of such preponement which the Plaintiff claims is insufficient compensation for the loss suffered by the Plaintiff upon having acted pursuant to the promise by the Defendant. The case of the promissory estoppel made out by the Plaintiff is sought to be compensated by additional compensation claimed in addition to the package offered by the Government. It would have to be seen whether the Defendant was without its rights to have modified licence of the Plaintiff by preponement of its monopolisation under the package and whether such modification was in the interest of general public or for the proper conduct of telegraphs. The Court adjudicating upon such a dispute would require to bear in mind the worldwide technical advances in the field of telecommunications as well as the economic development of India in that regard to determine how much, if at all, the package to be given by the Government would be required to be enhanced or compensation of a particular extent be awarded to the Plaintiff.  [Para 18]\n\nIt may be mentioned that the arbitration clause in the terms and conditions of the licence agreement can also be invoked by the parties so as to have their dispute decided by a skilled adjudicator who would take into consideration the causes and effects of the policy of the Defendant resulting in preponement of the monopolisation of the Plaintiff. It may also be mentioned that the rejection of the package offered by the Defendant as insufficient compensation by the Plaintiff itself requires creation of further options in the interest of both the parties to mitigate the loss, if any, by the demonopolisation of the Plaintiff which can be achieved best by the mode of mediation. This itself shows and suggests that the dispute between the parties if adjudicated upon would require its adjudication by a specialised tribunal which will be better equipped to handle various aspects for considering the adequacy or otherwise of the additional compensation claimed by the Plaintiff. It is for such cases that the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts is expressly barred under Sections 15 and 27 of the Telecom Act. 2007 ALL SCR 2834 - Ref. to.  [Para 23]"

In the case of the former, i.e. a person who is economically dependent on another who is paying his telephone bills, the telephone line in the name of such other relative on whom the subscriber is dependent can be disconnected for non-payment of the telephone bills of the nominal subscriber.   [Para 19]\n\nIn this case, the literal rule has not to be adopted, because we have also to see the intention of the rule.  The intention obviously was that payment of telephone dues should be made promptly, otherwise the telephone department will suffer.  In the case of a wife who is a housewife and is economically dependent on her husband, obviously the telephone bills in connection with the line in her name are being paid by her husband and not by herself.   [Para 21,22]\n\nTo interpret a statute one has to sometimes consider the context in which it has been made and the purpose and object which it seeks to achieve.

But where the belated correction of the alleged omissions leads to a huge increase in the normal billing and where there is no acceptable evidence supporting such increased claim, then the subscriber having been denied the opportunity to protest or object to the increased claim and secure monitoring of the installation or inspection of the system, cannot be burdened with a revised increased billing.

Moreover, in comparing marks, regard must be had not only to their form as they appear on the Register but also to the appearance they would present in actual user. It is pertinent to note that these marks are embossed on the milk cans manufactured by the parties. The embossed milk cans were produced for our examination. The embossed version on the milk cans looks almost identical. It is therefore not possible to agree with the view taken by the learned Judge that the device of cow is not likely to be confused with the device of ox. One cannot compare two trade marks by putting them side by side by trying to find out similarities and differences in the two marks. What one has to see is the overall impression which the trade mark gives. Because this is what the members of the public carry in their minds.   [Para 5]"

It is also alleged that the respondents having acquired knowledge of technology and manufacturing of machine from the appellants, the same is being utilised dishonestly for causing confusion in the minds of the buyers of such product.  In such a suit, for the purpose of considering an application for temporary injunction on the basis of the facts alleged in the suit for action of passing off, certainly, it would be necessary for the Court to ascertain whether the acts of the respondents prima facie disclose unfair trading with the intention to injure the business of the appellants.  The conduct of the parties in such case would certainly assume great importance. [Para 10]\n\nIn the instant case materials on record prima facie make out a case of deceit on the part of the respondents in relation to the product of the appellants, more particularly by use of the mark \"Hydroclave\".  The respondents are, therefore, prima facie engaged in the acts of representing themselves as part of the family of the appellants and at the same time supplying their own product as that of the appellants, using the term \"Hydroclave\" in the name of the product manufactured by the respondents.  Prima facie, therefore, the term \"Hydroclave\" refers to the key word which is helpful to the respondents in such activities.  This being unfair trading on the part of the respondents to the prejudice of the appellants, certainly the appellants would be entitled for necessary protection against such acts on the part of the respondents. Prima facie, therefore, it is established that the appellants have acquired distinctiveness in relation to the mark \"Hydroclave\" in connection with their product and with the use of the term \"Hydroclave\" and the conduct of the respondents in relation to their product disclose acts of representing themselves as part of the family of the appellants.  Apparently, if the respondents are allowed to carry on with the manufacture and supply of their product with the name \"Hydroclave\", it is bound to confuse the customers and cause irreparable loss to the appellants.  Prior user of the mark \"Hydroclave\" and the reputation acquired by the appellants in relation to the said mark prima facie indicate the goods with such mark to have been originated from the appellants and the use of such mark for the product of the respondents prima facie disclose intention to pass off their product as those of the appellants or at least likelihood of the buyers being confused or misled into that belief.  The refusal of injunctive relief in the circumstances of the case to the appellants therefore is bound to incur irreparable injury to their reputation and goodwill since trade in the name of \"Hydroclave\" has been prima facie established to be associated with the appellants apart from being the first and prior user.  The balance of convenience also therefore lies in favour of the appellants.\t [Para 33,34]\n\n(1996) 5 SCC 714 and AIR 1999 P& H 231 - Referred to."

It is, therefore, plain that in the present case the Receiver has been appointed in respect of the property in the trade marks with all powers of the owner.  This would, therefore, include all the powers conferred on the registered proprietor.  Therefore, the Receiver on whom all the powers of the registered proprietor are conferred in relation to trade mark must, therefore, be held to be perfectly competent to exercise the rights conferred by section 28, including the right to obtain relief in respect of infringement of the trade mark in the manner provided by the Trade and Merchandise Marks Act, 1958.  Indeed this must be so.  Otherwise, the Receiver would be incapacitated and would not be able to exercise the powers specifically conferred upon him by Order 40 i.e. to bring and defend suits for protection, preservation and improvement of the property which the owner imposes.  Therefore, even if it is true that it is essential for the existence of the trade mark that there should be some connection between the registered owner and the mark and that the connection is essential, it does not follow that the Receiver cannot bring the suit for protection of the trade mark in the absence of such a personal connection with the trade mark because the property in the registered trade mark subsists.  In law and for all practical purposes, the Receiver stands in the shoes of the owner and must be held entitled to do all such acts necessary for the preservation and protection of the property, including trade marks, for which he is appointed a Receiver.  It is also not possible to accept the contention that apart from the owner only a person in whom the property vests by operation of law can bring the suit.  There is no doubt that there is a distinction between the rights of an Official Assignee in whom the property vests by virtue of section 17 of the Presidency Town Insolvency Act and those of a Receiver in whom the property does not vest in the sense that he does not become an owner.  What is important is that on the Receiver are conferred all the powers of an owner.  Therefore, if the owner has the power to bring a suit, the Receiver must also be taken to have that power.

So far as the use of photograph of the male model on the panel is concerned, it is true that the Defendants have not in their affidavit given any explanation on this aspect of the matter, still a singular unexplained similarity in the two labels can not lead one, in the face of so many dissimilarities, to the conclusion that there is an intention on the part of the Defendants to deceive and to pass off their product as that of the Plaintiffs.

In order to obtain relief the appellant had to primafacie establish that the disputed Trade Mark had become by user distinctive of the plaintiffs goods so that the use in relation to any goods of the kind dealt with by the appellant of that mark would be understood by trade and public as meaning that the goods were of the appellant.  In other words it must be primafacie established that the mark adopted by the respondent is calculated to deceive and to lead the customer to believe that they are buying the goods of the appellant.  The probability plays an important role in this respect.  Appeal against an interim order would be treated more like a revision.  The doctrine transborder reputation considered."

The plaintiff, must, in order to succeed in obtaining temporary injunction in passing off action make out prima facie case on the basis of pleading and available material.  To establish prima facie case in such action plaintiff is required to show the user of its trade mark for sufficient long period continuously in contradistinction to defendant's recent user of such deceptively similar and identical trade mark.  The plaintiff must assert his right with promptitude without unreasonable delay.  The plaintiff is required to show that his products have acquired distinctiveness and reputation in the trade and public and are identified by the marks they bear.  The activity of plaintiff and defendant should be demonstrated to be same or similar so also the product, the sphere and market of consumption.  And not the least that the use of the said trade mark or trade name by the defendant is likely to deceive, confuse or mislead in the public mind resulting in injury to the plaintiff's goodwill, reputation and business.\n\nIn the instant case the polythene bags designed by the defendants are clearly designed to deceive the trade and public into believing that these polythene bags containing cow milk are in fact polythene bags of the plaintiff.  The use of the mark \"MAA-ANAND COW MILK (HOMOGENISED AND PASTEURISED)\" gives the imitation of it being the product marketed by the plaintiff.  The plaintiffs have been marketing their product since 1984 and the figures stated by the plaintiff in plaint clearly demonstrate that they have acquired goodwill and reputation of their milk in the market.  The defendants started marketing the milk product in their name \"MAA-ANAND COW MILK (HOMOGENISED AND PASTEURISED)\" somewhere in the May, 1997.  In the circumstances, therefore, the plaintiffs have been clearly been able to make out prima facie case that the trade mark \"\"MAHANAND COW MILK (HOMOGENISED AND PASTEURISED)\" has acquired reputation and goodwill of the milk product sold by the plaintiffs in the mind of the public and potential buyers.  Plaintiffs, thus, deserve protection of their right of prior user of trade mark as the benefit of the name and reputation earned by them for more than a decade cannot be taken advantage of by the defendants or any other trader by copying the mark and pass off their (defendants) milk as a product of the plaintiffs."

A domain name is more than an Internet address and is entitled to the equal protection as trade mark.  With the advancement and progress in the technology, the services rendered in the Internet site have also come to be recognised and accepted and are being given protection so as to protect such provider of service from passing off the services rendered by others as his services.  1999 PTC (19) 201 Rel. on.  [Para 11]\n\nIn this case, the plaintiffs are carrying on their business of communication and providing services through the Internet.  Amongst the services provided by the plaintiffs, the plaintiffs are publishing advertisement of their clients by setting up web pages for their clients and/or by publishing their clients, advertisements on the plaintiffs' web pages.  The plaintiffs also provide services such as sale of cinema tickets of selected theatres  in Bombay, make hotel bookings and selling books and other goods etc. The services of the plaintiffs under trade mark/domain name \"REDIFF\" have been widely published.  The turnover of plaintiffs group companies is over Rs.250 crores.  The Plaintiff company's individual turn over is also substantial.  In the instant case both the plaintiffs and the defendant have common field of activity.  They are operating  on the website and providing information of similar nature.  Both the plaintiffs and the defendants offer facility of sale of books, music cassettes and compact discs and flowers.  Both offer a chat line and both presently offer a cricket opinion poll.  There can be no doubt that the two marks/domain names, 'REDIFF' of the plaintiffs and 'RADIFF' of the defendants are almost similar.  When both domain names are considered it is clearly seen that two names being almost similar in nature there is every possibility of Internet user being confused and deceived in believing that both domain names belong to one common source and connection although two belong to different persons.    [Para 17]\n\nOnce the intention to deceive is established, the court will not make further enquiry about likelihood of confusion.  If it is found that man's object in doing that which he did was to deceive, that  he has an intention to deceive, the court will be very much more ready to infer that his object has been achieved, if the facts tend to show that  is the case and to say that his intention to deceive ripening into deceipt gives ground for an injunction.  [Para 19]\n\nA first time visitor to website cannot possibly distinguish one website from another website which also he has not visited.  Besides this, as a result of the adoption of the domain name \"\"RADIFF\"\", the public are likely to associate the defendants' domain name with the plaintiffs and/or as part of the Rediffusion group.

The suffixes \"DINE\" and \"DIN\" in these two marks are almost similar except  the fact that suffix in the mark \"PV-DINE\" consists of 4 letters where as the suffix in the mark \"PIODIN\" consists of three letters.

The prefix in \"PV-DINE\" consists of two letter \"PV\" whereas the pre-fix in the mark \"PIODIN\" consists of three letters \"PIO\".  However, there is not much difference in the pronouncement of the same.  Thus a fast or faint utterance of both the marks is very much likely to make a confusion that they are one and the same.  It is a common knowledge that in our country English is not a mother tongue and therefore, pronunciations are different from person to persons.  For instance some people pronounce \"School\" as \"Eschool\", \"Para as \"Pera\", \"Bank\" as \"Baink\", \"Report\" as \"Repot\" and so on.  Therefore, it is not unlikely that the mark \"PV-DINE\" is likely to be pronounced as \"PIODIN\".

A Plaintiff to maintain an action has to first satisfy, in the case of a descriptive word, that it has acquired distinctive or secondary meaning in connection with the Plaintiffs business, so that the use of those words in the trade name adopted by another is likely to deceive the public.

The invention is not theirs. They have collaboration with other. The word Disk and Tube is descriptive of the technology used and had not obtained any distinctiveness. Consequently, it can be held that the plaintiff have failed to make out a strong prima facie case which is the requirement for an injunction. [Para 8]"

In the first place though the words may not be strictly descriptive of the Plaintiffs' mark it does tend to be descriptive and in any case laudatory in the sense that it suggests that use of the product would contribute to life, well being and strength.  In a situation such as this it is settled law that where such words are used, unless the Plaintiff shows that the words have acquired a secondary significance, such that it has displaced the primary significance and meaning of the word, the Defendants should not be prevented from using similar words which are part of common language.  Viewed from that angle, it is clear that the Plaintiffs' mark AYUSHAKTI is not so exclusive or so inevitably associated with the Plaintiffs' product that the word AYUSH standing alone cannot be used by anyone else.\n\nThe use of the word AYUSH would not create any confusion as there is reason for coming to this conclusion that there is no confusion in the words.  Since the words are not similar, and are pronounced and also read differently, there is no reason for customers to imagine that the product AYUSH has the same origin as those of the products sold under the name AYUSHAKTI.  Merely because it is possible to imagine that a given person may get confused as to the product, it is no reason to imagine that every one would get confused.  Court do not believe that the law is that if a single person gets confused it must be taken that the words create such confusion.  It must be remembered that claims in passing off action are not for an infringement of property rights but, for misrepresentation by the Defendant.  Therefore, if the alleged confusion is the result of the exercise by the Defendant of his legitimate rights to use certain common words in order to compete with the Plaintiff the Court must be hesitant in granting such an injunction.  At the prima facie stage, without actual instances of witness having been deceived, it would be sufficient for the court to form a broad impression that there is no confusion by and large and not decide merely on the basis of an affidavit of a person who claims that he got confused or as observed in some cases.  In this view of the matter, Court considered it appropriate to refuse the injunction.  2002(24) PTC 341 (Bombay), AIR 1970 SC 1649 and AIR 1960 SC 142 - Referred to.\t [Para 19,20,22]"

The Court has to keep in mind the possibility that with the passage of time, some conflict may occur between the use of the mark by the Applicant in India and the user by the overseas company. The Court must ensure that public interest is in no way imperiled. Doctors particularly eminent doctors, medical practitioners and persons or Companies connected with medical field keep abrest of latest developments in medicine and preparations worldwide. Medical literature is freely available in this country. Doctors, medical practitioners and persons connected with the medical field regularly attend medical conferences, symposiums, lecturs etc. It must also be remembered that nowadays goods are widely advertised in newspapers, periodicals, magazines and other media which is available in the country. This results in a product acquiring a worldwide reputation. Thus, if a mark in respect of a drug is associated with the Respondents worldwide it would lead to an anomalous situation if an identical mark in respect of a similar drug is allowed to be sold in India. However, one note of caution must be expressed. Multinational corporations, who have no intention of coming to India or introducing their product in India should not be allowed to throttle an Indian Company by not permitting it to sell a product in India, if the Indian Company has genuinely adopted the mark and developed the product and is first in the market. Thus the ultimate test should be who is first in the market.   [Para 7]"

The person in whose name the trade mark has been registered may take action against any person for passing off the goods as that of the registered owner. It confers an exclusive right of use of the trade mark in relation to the goods in which the trade mark is registered. The same is an assignable right in terms of Section 36 of the Act, whereas an unregistered trade mark is not. So long as the right to assign a registered trade mark remains valid, once the same is validly assigned, the assignee derives the same right as that of the assignor in terms of the statute. A title to a trade mark derived on assignment as provided for under the Act cannot be equated with a defective title acquired in any other property as admittedly on the date of assignment, the right of the registered trade mark was not extinguished.  \t\t\t\t\t [Para 19,30]\n\nThe non-user of registered trade-mark entails the consequences laid down under S.46(1)(b) of Trade and Merchandise Marks Act (1958). However, such an application can be filed only by a person aggrieved. When the applicant before the Board establishes the fact in regard to non-user of the mark for a period of more than five years on the part of the registered owner, the latter may show that his case falls within the purview of sub-section (3) of Section 46. It must not, however, be forgotten that Section 46(1)(b) provides for a special remedy. As a person obtains a right on and from the date of registration and/or renewal thereof, he can ordinarily be deprived of his right unless it is shown that the assignment thereof by his holder was not a bona fide one or had been made by way of camouflage. If the assignee has obtained assignment for bona fide use, he may not be fastened with any liability owing to non-user on the part of his predecessor. In other words, the mistake of the predecessor should not be visited with non-use of the present registered owner. Also, an assigner can transfer only such right which he possesses. If his title is not extinguished by reason of a provision of a statute for non-user of the trade mark for a period of five years, any assignment made shall be valid.

That finding is purely a question of fact, which was affirmed by the learned Single Judge as well as the Division Bench. The Division Bench has also found no error in the inclusion of another District also for selling the rice and later extending the benefit of the trademark to the respondents to the whole State of Uttar Pradesh. It was pointed out that restricting the trademark to few cities would create lot of complications and litigations as to the exact boundary of a particular city or District. It will also be impossible for the respondents to ensure that its products are not sold to retailers outside the six cities.

The statute law relating to infringement of trade marks is based on certain fundamental ideas which may be common to the law relating to passing off but it differs in two particular aspects, namely, the use of trade mark is one of the methods of passing off and secondly, the statutory protection in the case of a registered trade mark is absolute in the sense that once a mark is shown to offend, the user of it cannot escape by showing something outside the actual mark itself. Therefore, infringement takes place, not merely by exact imitation, but by the use of the mark nearly resembling the registered mark as to be likely deceptive.\n1941(98) RPC 147  Followed.  [Para 7]"

                "description": "Deceptive similarity - \"ROLAC\" registered trade mark of plaintiffs - Defendants using trade mark \"TOROLAC\" - Both medicinal preparations - Held, ROLAC is invented word, there was resemblance between ROLAC and TOROLAC and resemblance was structural as well as visual and phonetic - There was deceptive similarity between the two - Patient going to chemist was likely to be deceived or confused which could lead to disastrous consequences - Plaintiffs having made out strong case which required consideration at final trial, they were entitled to interim injunction.\nCivil P.C. (1905), O.39, Rr. 1 and 2\n\nIn the present case, at this interim stage, the question is whether use of the mark \"TOROLAC\" infringes the registered trade mark \"ROLAC\". Firstly it may be noted that the trade mark \"ROLAC\" has been registered in the year 1986. Secondly, the word ROLAC is an invented word. It is not an ordinary word or a generic word like \"COLA\" which can be used with \"COCA - COLA\" or \"PEPSI - COLA\" which is known to the trade. Thirdly, we are dealing with medicinal and pharmaceutical preparations. The preparation of the plaintiffs has a therapeutic value whereas preparation of the defendants has an analgesic effect, disastrous consequences may flow if there is a mix-up in the matter of consumption of the two preparations. TOROLAC being an analgesic will not be of any therapeutic use for patients of acidity who will not get symptomatic relief. On the contrary, the patients' condition could worsen because TOROLAC  contains toxic potentials and side effects. Fourthly, the entire registered trade mark \"TOROLAC\" has been borrowed and adopted by merely prefixing it with the two letters \"TO\" which clearly indicates that even on first impression, the essential features of both the marks are deceptively similar and it constitutes coloured imitation or nearing resemblance. In the circumstances, probable confusion cannot be ruled out. There is resemblance between ROLAC  and TOROLAC. The said resemblance is structural as well as visual and phonetic. The sound of one word resembles the sound of another, on first impression. Fifthly, it is also important to bear in mind that a patient who knows only one word and if he has imperfect recollection of the said word, he is likely to be deceived or confused when he purchases the medicine. No patient goes to the Chemist for purchase of both the medicines ROLAC and TOROLAC. He will go for one of them and he may not recollect the other, in which event, he is likely to be deceived or confused which may led to disastrous consequences. In the above circumstances, the doctrine of wonderment is also applicable to the facts of the present case. There is no merit in the contention of the defendants that the word TORO will make a difference. There is also no merit in the contention of the defendants that the word TORO is emphatic because in such cases meticulous comparison of the two words, letter by letter and syllable by syllable pronounced with the clarity to be expected from a teacher of alliteration is not possible. In such cases, the Courts have laid down a very important test which, applies in this case viz. to make allowance for imperfect recollection and the effect of careless pronunciation and speech on the part of the patient and also on the part of the Chemist. Therefore, it is the judicial ear that is decisive and the conclusion must be based on the surrounding circumstances, Applying the above test, in the present case, that the plaintiffs have raised a serious contention which requires consideration. It is not possible for the defendants to contend that serious consideration of the facts is not involved at the trial of the suit, particularly when the two marks are confusingly similar. They are close in sound and sight. A person who only knows ROLAC and who has an imperfect recollection will be deceived and confused if the Chemist asked him for TOROLAC and vice-versa. In the circumstances, there is merit in the contentions advanced on behalf of the plaintiffs with regard to deceptive similarity between the two medical proportions which may lead to disastrous consequences.  [Para 7]\n\nIn such matters, balance of convenience plays a very important role. At the interim stage the Court will consider whether serious issues have been raised by the plaintiff. If the defendant does not establish on evidence that there was no serious issue to be tried and if the Courts, find that there is ample evidence required to be examined at the trial and that a serious issue of deception is involved which requires to be tried, then the Court will grant injunction in favour of the plaintiff. The facts indicate that the exclusive right to use the trade mark by the plaintiffs would play an important element in the matter of achieving sales. What the plaintiffs will loose from infringement cannot be quantified at the final hearing of the matter and, therefore, damages would not be adequate remedy. It is true that grant of injunction would also cause losses to the defendants. However, in the present case, looking to the nature of the evidence on which the defendants have relied, since the plaintiffs have made a very strong case which requires consideration at the final trial, refusal to grant injunction in favour of the plaintiffs would cause irreparable damage to the plaintiffs, who are registered proprietors of the trade mark. Interim injunction granted.\n\n1994 Fleet Street Reports 745 Referred.  [Para 8,11]"

Mere copying is not to pass off.  If a person copies shape or configuration or get up of other person's goods or article, by itself it cannot be said that he has made false representation.  No one is prevented from copying and selling an article in the market provided he does not make a false representation suggesting that the article which he is selling is in fact that of Plaintiff.  Monopoly in the property is only preserved in favour of registered design holder.  If the Plaintiff has to succeed on the ground of passing off, he must show something more than mere similarity between the goods.  [Para 17]\n\nWhen these principles are applied to the facts in hand, it would be noticed that the Plaintiffs design of baby chair with human face backrest and with removable inserts was made for educational purposes of the children.  The Plaintiffs themselves in para 5 of the plaint have averred that the 1st Plaintiff first conceived the idea of providing a novel shape and design to a baby chair with human face on backrest with removable inserts having educational value.  These features according to the Plaintiffs primarily have value in use and, therefore I find there is no restriction for the Defendants to copy that if they do not make false representation.  From the available material it is clear that the Defendants are not making false representation which may give the Plaintiffs cause of action because the Defendants are selling the said chairs with conspicuous level \"Prima\" while the Plaintiffs are selling the said chairs with trade mark Moderna Champ.  [Para 19]\n\nHowever, despite the fact that  primafacie the Plaintiffs have not been able to make out a case for interim injunction or Receiver as prayed for, unconditional order of refusal may lead to a situation where if ultimately the Plaintiffs succeed in the trial, they may not be able to even get damages.  To avoid that situation,  interest of justice would be served if some conditions are imposed on the Defendant which may safeguard the rights and interest of the Plaintiffs in case they succeed ultimately in the suit.  Accordingly it would be in the interest of justice, if the Defendants are called upon to file an undertaking to pay damages in the event of Plaintiffs succeeding ultimately in the suit.

It is not necessary nor should they be placed side by side to find out if there are any differences in the design and if so, whether they are of such character as to prevent one design from being mistaken for the other. In the eye of law, it would be enough if the incriminating mark bears such an overall similarity to the distinctive mark as would be likely to mislead a person usually dealing with one to accept the other if offered to him. It is of no use to note on how many points there is similarity and on how many others, there was absence of it. In passing off action, one is not to look to minor details but must take into consideration the essential feature/s. An action for passing off is common law remedy being in substance an action for deceit, that is, a passing off action by a person of his own goods as those of another. The real question is as to how a purchaser who must be looked upon as an average man of ordinary intelligence, would react with particular trade mark, what association he would form by looking at the trade mark, and in what respect he would connect the trade mark with the goods which he would be purchasing.  [Para 11]\n\nIn this case in the Distinctive Carton the words \"VICKS ACTION 500\" are printed while on the offending carton, the words \"ENDO ACTION\" are printed, the said dissimilarity pales into insignificance in view of its broad similarity in essential features of two cartons. The overall similarity in the two cartons, namely, Distinctive Cartons and the Offending cartons cannot be doubted. Similarly, the Distinctive strips and the incriminating strips have broad similarity in essential features inasmuch as both these strips has silver background having green triangles with red rectangle bands. The upper portion has green base in both these strips and the colour of tablet contained therein is yellowish. The triangle and the red band therein with the word mark ENDO ACTION in offending strips are prominent and bold while the green triangle with red band having \"Vicks Action 500\" printed thereon in distinctive strips are small in size. But despite this dissimilarity, there is broad similarity in essential features in the Distinctive strips and the incriminating strips. Prima facie, therefore, broad similarities in Distinctive Cartons and Strips and the incriminating strips and cartons cannot be doubted. However, the material on record placed by the 1st Defendant prima facie establishes that the alleged offending cartons and the strips of ENDO ACTION manufactured by the 1st Defendant company came into scene in May 1997 much before Plaintiffs' distinctive cartons and strips. The use of the word 'Action' by itself cannot be said to be essential feature of plaintiffs distinctiveness. Hence the plaintiffs have failed to make out prima facie case of passing off as pleaded and infringement of copyright.  [Para 14,17,19]"

Misrepresentation, therefore, in the passing off action has to be pleaded in the same manner as is required to be pleaded in any of the cases of the misrepresentation. A party basing its claim on misrepresentation of the defendant has to specifically plead the details of misrepresentation and cannot leave upon the Court to find out what the misrepresentation is.

There is no pleading worth the name in the entire plaint that the essential feature of the distinctiveness is in the triangle which the Plaintiffs urged on the basis of Affidavit in Rejoinder to be an essential feature of Plaintiffs' distinctive cartons and the strips. The prima facie case has to be established by the Plaintiffs on the basis of pleadings. When the Plaintiffs have solely come out with the case alleging that Defendants are passing off their goods as the goods of the Plaintiffs in incriminating cartons and the strips which is deceptively similar to distinctive cartons and strips, case has to be tested on the basis of that pleading and that pleading alone and since the Plaintiffs' case is that the distinctive cartons and the strips came into existence in the month of October 1998 and the 1st Defendant has been able to show that the alleged incriminating or the offending cartons and strips came on scene in the month of May 1997 much before the Plaintiffs' distinctive cartons and the strips came into existence, prima facie, the Plaintiffs have failed in making out their case as set out in the plaint.

                "description": "Trade mark \"Rodine\" - Schedule 4 - Trade and Merchandise Marks Rules 1959, Schedule 4, Class 1 - Suit filed under S.105 - Issue of temporary injunction - Prima facie proprietary right has to be established.\n\nIn order to entitle the Plaintiff to temporary injunction in terms in which it is sought in Notice of Motion, the Plaintiff will have to establish, prima facie, that they have proprietary rights in the trade-mark Rodine. A person can acquire proprietary right in a trade-mark by establishing that the mark was originated by him or that he has acquired it. In so far as the present case is concerned, the Plaintiff does not claim that he originated the trademark. According to the averments in the plaint and the affidavit filed in support of the motion, the Plaintiff claims that it is manufacturing and marketing their product under the trade-mark Rodine since 1959. Thus, the Plaintiff claims that they adopted trade-mark Rodine in the year 1959 and thereby they acquired proprietary rights in that trade-mark. The Trade mark Rodine was registered in favour of Amchem Corporation in Jan 1946. The registration according to law is granted for 15 years and therefore, the registration in favour Amchem Corporation of the trade-mark Rodine was current and in force in 1959. Section 28 of the Act gives exclusive right to the registered proprietor of the trade-mark to use the  trade-mark in relation to the goods in respect of which the trade-mark is registered. Therefore, even if it is assumed that the Plaintiff started using the trade-mark Rodine in the year 1959, the use of the trade mark Rodine by the Plaintiffs in the year 1959 was contrary to law and therefore, it will not confer any rights on the Plaintiffs. The trade-mark was assigned to the Plaintiff in the year 1963 by Amchem Corporation and from 1963 till August, 1973 the Plaintiff was using the trade-mark Rodine as assignee of the trade-mark. However, in the month of August, 1973, the trade-mark was reassigned to Amchem Corporation by the Plaintiff. \t [Para 13]\n\nFurther, a person in whose favour trade-mark has been assigned has to make an application for getting assignment recorded in the register in his favour. If the document of assignment in relation to which the entry has not been made by the Registrar in accordance with the provisions of sub-section 1 of Section 44 of the Act, the document cannot be admitted in the evidence, in any Court in proof of title of the trade-mark, unless the Registrar or the court otherwise directs. Thus, so far as assignment of trade-mark by Amchem Corporation in favour of the Plaintiff in the year 1963 is concerned, the position that emerges is that though agreement of assignment was entered into, the assignment was never recorded in the register, with the result Amchem Corporation continued to be the registered proprietor of the trade-mark and the user of the trade-mark by the Plaintiff from 1963 would, at best, be termed as a permissive user. Thus under the agreement the Plaintiff was using the trade-mark subject to the control by Amchem corporation and the agreement permitted Amchem Corporation to use the said trade-mark in India, in case the import regulations so permit. It is, thus, clear that the use of the trade-mark by the Plaintiff from 1959 appears to be permissive use and not an exclusive use in its own rights. Thus, prima facie, it is clear that the Plaintiff has failed to establish that they were exclusively using the trade-mark Rodine as proprietor thereof since 1959.\t\t\t\t\t [Para 13]\n\nThe plaintiff has also not established that Trade Mark Rodine was abandoned by Amchem Corporation in 1977 as claimed. Hence it is clear that the plaintiff has not established clearly on record either the case pleaded by them in relation to acquisition of proprietary right in the trade-mark in the plaint or in the affidavit filed in the motion. The Plaintiff cannot succeed in establishing the prima facie case unless it presents before the court a clear case. In the present case, the Plaintiff has made contradictory statements and has not presented before the Court a clear case and therefore, it cannot be said that the Plaintiff has been able to make out prima facie case in its favour.\t\t\t [Para 14]"

In view of registration of marks, the plaintiffs had an exclusive right to use the said mark \"SPOXIN\", and they were also entitled to prevent any other person from using an identical mark or a mark 'deceptively similar' to such mark.  [Para 15]\n\nThe case of the appellants is that suffix 'XIN' being common to both the drugs, there is likelihood of confusion.  The mark of the plaintiffs is registered, and, hence, it has statutory protection.  It relates to a medicinal preparation.  In the circumstances, the test of 'possibility' laid down in Cadila Health Care Ltd. (AIR 2001 SC 1952) would apply.  Applying the said test, there is likelihood, or in any case, possibility of consumer being confused, and the plaintiffs were entitled to interim injunction.  Moreover, SPOXIN and SUPAXIN are visually, phonetically and structurally similar.  No doubt, both the drugs are sold under prescription, but that fact alone is not sufficient to prevent confusion which is likely to arise.

The point is finally set at rest in Cadila Health Care Ltd. and, hence, the order passed by the learned Single Judge cannot be sustained.  In our opinion, however, when the test is 'possibility' of confusion in medicinal preparations, as held by the Supreme Court in Cadila Health Care Ltd., and the Courts have been asked by the apex Court to take special care, in such cases, since confusion may harm and result in unpleasant consequences, if not disastrous results, the learned Single Judge ought to have granted injunction as prayed by the plaintiffs.  Since the learned Single Judge has, prima facie, recorded findings which can be said to be adjudicatory in nature, and by taking the view that there was no likelihood of confusion on the part of customers or repercussion on health as the drugs are available only on doctor's prescription, and a wrong test was applied, the appellants are right in contending that the decision deserves interference.

There is also no dispute that in partnership, trade marks are considered to be an integral part of the goodwill of the business.\t [Para 16]\n\nIt is not possible to accept the contention that because the plaintiff is not trading in the goods, she is not entitled to an injunction on the ground of passing off simply because the defendants goods cannot be confused with non-existent goods of the plaintiff.  In the first place, the action of passing-off is not based on the property in the mark name or get-up improperly used by the defendants.  It is a remedy against invasion of the property in the business or goodwill likely to be injured by the misrepresentation of the defendant that his goods are those of plaintiffs.  Therefore, if such goodwill in the business can be shown to exist, then obviously that business or goodwill can be invaded and the plaintiff can protect it by seeking an action is passing-off.  (1951)32 R.P.C. 273 and 1931 ALL E.R 74 - Rel. on.\t\t\t [Para 17]\n\nIt does not require much to notice in the present case and in other cases of dissolution that the elements of goodwill mentioned by Scrutton L.J. are still around when a firm is dissolved.  Till its assets are distributed, particularly in a case as the present one where the trade marks have been successfully used for over half a century, it must be held that the goodwill survives upon dissolution.  In any case, the Partnership Act deems the existence of the goodwill even after dissolution of the firm.  Though it was suggested by Dr. Tulzapurkar, learned counsel for the defendant no.1, that the action for infringement of the trade mark would also not be tenable if goodwill is found to have become non-existent, it appears that there is no support whatsoever for this proposition since the right to sue for infringement of a trade mark is a statutory right and in the present case, there is no dispute that the mark is on the register and no proceedings for removal of the mark have been initiated.  The application for injunction must, therefore, be held to be perfectly tenable both on the ground of passing-off as well as on the ground of infringement of the trade mark.  Therefore, the goodwill of a firm which is deemed to be the property of the firm clearly survives after the dissolution.\t [Para 18]"

In an action for infringement where the Defendant's trade mark is identical with the Plaintiff's trade mark, the Court would not inquire whether the infringement was likely to deceive or cause confusion. If the Defendant's mark is similar to the Plaintiff, it would require to be proved as in a passing off action. When the two marks are identical, no further questions arise - infringement is made out. When the two marks are not identical, the Plaintiff would have to establish that the Defendant's marks so resemble the Plaintiff's as is likely to cause confusion.

What would be deceptively similar, as defined in Section 2(d) of the 1958 Act, would be a mark if it nearly resembles that other mark as to be likely to deceive or cause confusion. It is, therefore, not a case where the respondents could raise valid defence in terms of Section 29 of the 1958 Act.  The right conferred in terms of Section 28 of the 1958 Act although is required to be read with Sections 15 and 17 thereof but it is difficult to accept that each part of the logo was required to be separately registered. Section 28 of the 1958 Act confers an exclusive right of using trade mark to a person who has got the trade mark registered in his name. Such right is, thus, absolute.   [Para 85,86]"

Although, the defendant may not be using the actual trade mark of the plaintiff, the get up of the defendant's goods may be so much like the plaintiff's that a clear case of passing off could be proved. It is also possible that the defendant may be using the plaintiff's mark, the get up of the defendant's goods may be so different from the get up of the plaintiff's goods and the prices also may be so different that there would be no probability of deception of the public. However, in an infringement action, an injunction would be issued if it is proved that the defendant is improperly using the plaintiff's mark. In an action for infringement where the defendant's trade-mark is identical with the plaintiff's mark, the Court will not enquire whether the infringement is such as is likely to deceive or cause confusion.  The test, therefore, is as to likelihood of confusion or deception arising from similarity of marks is the same both in infringement and passing off actions. \t\t\t\t\t\t       [Para 92,94]"

The text is written in gold lettering in almost identical font.  Even the words in the last line \"PAPER,COPY,FAX\" are written identically with the full-stop in between.  Other than the plaintiffs there is no other highlighter which is called \"TEXTLINER\".  Thus while it is possible to argue that anybody looking at the text of both would be able to see that the plaintiffs have \"FABER-CASTELL\" written on it and the defendants \"KOLORPIK\" written on it, in fact however the way the text is arranged and the colour of the lettering used markes it confusing, particularly when they are not looked at and compared simultaneously.  Such simultaneous comparison does not necessarily take place while purchasing.  Therefore, if the highlighter of the plaintiffs is seen and put down and thereafter the defendants is picked up and read, I am of view it would create a confusion.  The lettering is indistinguishable.  Apart from the lettering, the clip is also similar.  There is a minor variation, viz., a slight curve at the end of the clip, but it is something which would hardly be distinguishable at the time of purchase and even otherwise.  Similarly, the size and colour of the plug at the bottom is very similar.  The only difference seems to be the absence of serrations on the defendants highlighter which is hardly noticeable, particularly when each individual item is wrapped in a small polythene bag.  Similarly, there is sight difference at the two ends, in that the defendants highlighter is flat on the ends and whereas the ends of the plaintiffs highlighter are slightly curved.  But this is hardly noticeable.  Thus there is a confusing similarity in the text which includes the word \"TEXTLINER\", the colour of the text, the colour scheme and the get-up of the two highlighters in general.\n\nFurther, the colour of the body of the defendants TEXTLINER is identical with that of the plaintiffs i.e. deep green.  On the whole, there is a deceptive similarity.  Thus, in the present case, there is not only an adoption by the defendants of the trade mark \"TEXTLINER\" but the other material added to that is also added in such a way as to show an almost identical resemblance with that of the plaintiffs.\n\nThis is a case of deceptive similarity and definite misrepresentation.  The consequent damages by way of loss of sale, goodwill, reputation, etc. are, therefore, bound to follow.  The plaintiffs, therefore, have a prima facie case for the grant of an injunction.  Having come to this conclusion, the question of balance of convenience loses significance.  AIR 1965 SC 980 - Distinguished.  [Para 16,17,18]"

(1908), O.39, R.1.\n\nSection 44 does not create a bar for filing a suit by the assignee whose application is pending disposal for registration.  A discretion, however, is vested in the Court under sub-clause (2) of Section 44 of the Act, whether to permit the said unregistered document in evidence or not. At the same time, it cannot be said that the procedure of registration of assignment is a mere formality.  It appears from the various provisions that the legislature has thought it fit to scrutinise every application for assignment and transmission keeping in view the various other Acts, including the import restrictions, foreign exchange, etc., as also any inter se disputes between the assignor and assignee and only thereafter, if the Registrar is satisfied the said application for assignment would be registered. Therefore, the view taken by the Madras High Court in the case of T. I. Muhammad Zummon Sahib (supra) that the registration is a mere formality cannot be accepted.  In any case, in the said judgment, the question which fell for consideration before the Court was regarding the transmission of registration and in the said case the transmission had acquired finality by virtue of personal law prevailing at that time in respect of the plaintiff.  Lastly, during the pendency of the suit before the judgment was delivered, registration of transmission was already granted in favour of the plaintiff. Therefore, the said judgment will not be of any assistance to the appellant.  However, in the subsequent judgment in the matter of Belighty Industries Association, Court has held that the right to sue an unregistered proprietor is not in terms excluded but is affected by section 11 of the Act of 1919.  In the present case also, therefore, though the plaintiff is an unregistered assignee, it cannot be said that he is prevented from filing a suit during the pendency of the registration; for sub-clause (2) of the same Section clearly vests discretion with the Court either to admit the same in evidence or to reject the admissibility of the same in evidence.  The trial court, therefore, erred in holding that the document of assignment cannot be admitted in evidence as a proof of title to the trade marks. In view of sub-clause (2), the discretion is vested in the Court to examine as to whether it is admissible or not.  However, the registration of a Deed of Assignment would be one of the important factors which would have to be taken into consideration by the Court while deciding the question of grant of temporary injunction.  Section 44 has been incorporated merely as a safeguard by the legislature in order to avoid the multiplicity of the proceedings and also in order to ensure that the various other laws prevailing in the country are safeguarded while registering the assignment.  Thus, the grant of registration of assignment or transmission cannot be said to be a mere formality and on a conjoint reading of the provisions it will be apparent that the Registrar has to be satisfied after going through the application, which has to be filed in the prescribed form giving various particulars.  In the present case, non registration of the assignment will have to be considered as an important factor while deciding the question as to whether the plaintiff is entitled to the relief of temporary injunction during the pendency of the suit.

Whereas Cl.(a) refers to bona fide use of the trade mark; Cl.(b) stipulates the period upto a date of one month before the date of application, a continuous period of 5 years or longer elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being. Sub-S.(3) postulates an exclusion clause as regards application of Cl.(b) of Sub-S.(1) of S.46 if any non-use of a trade mark which is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade or not to any intention to abandon or not to use the trade mark in relation to the goods to which the application relates. The purpose for which Cls.(a) and (b) of Sub-S.(1) of S.46 on the one hand and Sub-S.(3) thereof, vis-a-vis S.56 of the Act on the other have been enacted are different purposes. Cls.(a) and (b) operate in different fields. Sub-S.(3) covers a case falling within Cl.(b) and not the Cl.(a) thereof. Had the intention of the Parliament been that Sub-S.(3) covers cases falling both under Cl.(b) and Cl.(a), having regard to the similarity of the expressions used, there was no reason as to why it could not be stated so explicitly. Moreover, in cases of intermittent use, Cl.(b) shall not apply. Cl.(a) of Sub-S.(1) of S.46 takes within its sweep a situation where registration has been obtained without any bona fide intention on the part of the registrant that it should be used in relation to those goods by him and that there has, in fact, been no bona fide use. Cl.(a), therefore, provides for more than one contingency. Both the preconditions laid down therein are required to be fulfilled and not the contingency which is contemplated by Cl.(1).

It confers, therefore, two remedies. The ingredients to establish that a case has been made out for removal of the registration of the appellant from the register, thus, are on separate grounds. If the High Court has refused to consider one of the grounds, its right was affected to urge the applicability of Cl.(b) being separate and distinct from the grounds on which contention can be raised for applying the ingredients of Cl.(a) being wholly distinct and different, the principles of O.XLI, R.33 of Code, would not be applicable. The causes of action for invoking Cls.(a) and (b) are different. When a composite application is filed, only different causes of action are joined together.

It would continue to be a person aggrieved even within purview of S.46 as it was slapped with a notice of action and it had a cause of action. It had a remedy. It invoked jurisdiction of Registrar on a large number of grounds. One of it was accepted, others were not. The petition, therefore, which was maintainable, did not cease to be so.   [Para 47,51]"

Appellant did not use it, no collaboration agreement with an Indian company nor did it grant any licence to any person to use the trade mark. In 1985 it had issued an advertisement before any controversy arose. It renewed the registration every seven years, validity extended upto 2016 A.D. It had been maintaining service centers in India in respect of washing machines though they weren't in a position to manufacture washing machines or spin dryers or market them because of ban imposed by Central Government. It had been rendering services to those who imported the machines. Though appellant had not been using its registered trade mark effectively, there was a finding by Registrar and High Court that it did not intend to abandon the said right, it intended to enforce its right as against respondent and suit was filed in 1990. There has been no injunction as against respondent. It was free to market its products in the name of TOSIBA. It had also, however, not been manufacturing washing machine and spin dryers. A finding of fact has been arrived at by Single Judge, which has not been overturned by Division Bench that respondent never had any intention to manufacture said goods. The balancing act between the user of registered trade mark and non-user should be such which leads to the possibility of neither of the parties being injured. Respondent in order to show how he is a person aggrieved has not shown how he in any possible way may be damaged or injured if the Appellant's Trade Mark is allowed to stand. This aspect of the matter was missed by the High Court. On this short ground impugned judgment cannot be sustained. Appeal allowed.

Order upheld in appeal. Supreme Court in further appeal held that provisions of O.2, Rr.2 and 3 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 (CPC) deals with pecuniary jurisdiction, which, however, can be used only in the event the court has otherwise jurisdiction in respect of the cause of action wherefor the action has been brought. Delhi Court has jurisdiction to adjudicate and decide upon relief of infringement of copyright, but not in respect of its action for passing off and confirmed the order directing return of plant for filing in the proper court. It further held under CPC claims arising under a statutes governing substantive or procedural law, a number of remedies can be combined. The Court may grant an order of injunction even in passing off action. Where the court has jurisdiction or power to adjudicate, it will necessarily have incidental power therefor. It may, however, be different if the court may have exercised a power which is not provided for as a supplemental proceeding. Thus, whereas incidental power is inherent in the court, a supplemental power may also be exercised, keeping in view the ultimate relief which may be granted by it.

In such a case anyone who uses the identical name albeit in a different field of business altogether would be guilty of passing-off by cashing in on the reputation and goodwill of the business of the plaintiff and would be restrained. The scope of passing-off action is wider than in an infringement of trademark or copyright action. Therefore, in an action of passing-off, an injunction can be granted even against a registered trademark holder. In the instant case the respondent company's mark 'Eenadu' has acquired extra-ordinary reputation and goodwill in the State of Andhra Pradesh. 'Eenadu' newspaper and TV are extremely well known and almost household words in the State of Andhra Pradesh. The word 'Eenadu' may be a descriptive word but has acquired a secondary or subsidiary meaning and is fully identified with the products and services provided by the respondent company. The appellant is a Karnataka based company which has started manufacturing its product in Bangalore in the name of 'Ashika' and started selling its product in the State of Andhra Pradesh in 1995. The appellant started using the name 'Eenadu' for its Agarbathi and used the same artistic script, font and method of writing the name which obviously cannot be a co-incidence. The appellant company after adoption of name 'Eenadu' accounted for 90% of sale of their product Agarbathi.\n\nHeld that, in the aforesaid circumstances, no one can be permitted to encroach upon the reputation and goodwill of the respondent company.\t [Para 100,101]\n\nAlso, on consideration of the totality of facts and circumstances of the case, the Supreme Court arrived at the following findings and conclusions :\n\na)\tThe respondent company's mark 'Eenadu' has acquired extraordinary reputation and goodwill in the State of Andhra Pradesh. The respondent company's products and services are correlated, identified and associated with the word 'Eenadu' in the entire State of Andhra Pradesh. 'Eenadu' means literally the products or services provided by the respondent company in the State of Andhra Pradesh. In this background the appellant cannot be referred or termed as an honest concurrent user of the mark 'Eenadu';\n\nb)\tThe adoption of the words 'Eenadu' is ex facie fraudulent and mala fide from the very inception. By adopting the mark 'Eenadu' in the State of Andhra Pradesh, the appellant clearly wanted to ride on the reputation and goodwill of the respondent company;\n\nc)\tPermitting the appellant to carry on his business would in fact be putting a seal of approval of the court on the dishonest, illegal and clandestine conduct of the appellant;\n\nd)\tPermitting the appellant to sell his product with the mark 'Eenadu' in the State of Andhra Pradesh would definitely create confusion in the minds of the consumers because the appellant is selling Agarbathies marked 'Eenadu' as to be designed or calculated to lead purchasers to believe that its product Agarbathies are in fact the products of the respondent company. In other words, the appellant wants to ride on the reputation and goodwill of the respondent company. In such a situation, it is the bounden duty and obligation of the court not only to protect the goodwill and reputation of the respondent company but also to protect the interest of the consumers;\n\ne)\tPermitting the appellant to sell its product in the State of Andhra Pradesh would amount to encouraging the appellant to practise fraud on the consumers;\n\nf)\tPermitting the appellant to carry on his business in the name of 'Eenadu' in the State of Andhra Pradesh would lead to eroding extra-ordinary reputation and goodwill acquired by the respondent company over a passage of time;\n\ng)\tAppellant's deliberate misrepresentation has the potentiality of creating serious confusion and deception for the public at large and the consumers have to be saved from such fraudulent and deceitful conduct of the appellant.\n\nh)\tPermitting the appellant to sell his product with the mark 'Eenadu' would be encroaching on the reputation and goodwill of the respondent company and this would constitute invasion of proprietary rights vested with the respondent company.\n\ni)\tHonesty and fair play ought to be the basis of the policies in the world of trade and business.

(1908), S.20 - Interpretation of S.62 and 134(2) - Purposive interpretation has to be adopted - Rule of convenience of the parties is behind provisions of S.62, 134(2) and S.20 of CPC - Intention is that plaintiff should not go to far flung places in order to deprive defendant of a remedy and harass him by dragging to distant place - Sections must be interpreted to avoid mischief.\n\nThe provisions of section 62 of the Copyright Act and section 134 of the Trade Marks Act have to be interpreted in the purposive manner. No doubt about it that a suit can be filed by the plaintiff at a place where he is residing or carrying on business or personally works for gain. He need not travel to file a suit to a place where defendant is residing or cause of action wholly or in part arises. However, if the plaintiff is residing or carrying on business etc. at a place where cause of action, wholly or in part, has also arisen, he has to file a suit at that place.  [Para 47]\n\nConsidering the very language of section 62 of the Copyright Act and section 134 of the Trade Marks Act, an additional forum has been provided by including a District Court within whose limits the plaintiff actually and voluntarily resides or carries on business or personally works for gain. The object of the provisions was to enable the plaintiff to institute a suit at a place where he or they resided or carried on business, not to enable them to drag defendant further away from such a place also as is being done in the instant cases. The expression \"notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Civil Procedure\" does not oust the applicability of the provisions of section 20 of the Code of Civil Procedure and it is clear that additional remedy has been provided to the plaintiff so as to file a suit where he is residing or carrying on business etc., as the case may be. Section 20 enables a plaintiff to file a suit where the defendant resides or where cause of action arose. Section 20(a) and section 20(b) usually provides the venue where the defendant or any of them resides, carries on business or personally works for gain. Section 20(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure enables a plaintiff to institute a suit where the cause of action wholly or in part, arises. The Explanation to Section 20 C.P.C. has been added to the effect that Corporation shall be deemed to carry on business at its sole or principal office in India or in respect of any cause of action arising at any place where it has subordinate office at such place. Thus, 'corporation' can be sued at a place having its sole or principal office and where cause of action wholly or in part, arises at a place where it has also a subordinate office at such place.\t [Para 12]\n\nIf the interpretation suggested by the appellant is accepted, several mischiefs may result, intention is that the plaintiff should not go to far flung places than that of residence or where he carries on business or works for gain in order to deprive defendant a remedy and harass him by dragging to distant place. It is settled proposition of law that the interpretation of the provisions has to be such which prevents mischief. According to the mischief rule, four points are required to be taken into consideration. While interpreting a statute, the problem or mischief that the statute was designed to remedy should first be identified and then a construction that suppresses the problem and advances the remedy should be adopted.  [Para 22]\n\nIn the instant cases, the principal place of business is, admittedly, in Mumbai and the cause of action has also arisen in Mumbai. Thus, the provisions of section 62 of the Copyright Act and section 134 of the Trade Marks Act cannot be interpreted in a manner so as to confer jurisdiction on the Delhi court in the aforesaid circumstances to entertain such suits. The Delhi court would have no territorial jurisdiction to entertain it.\t    [Para 23]"

In such a case, the first user cannot claim exclusivity in his trade mark or in the name which is derived from the generic drug. At the most such proprietor can claim exclusivity in those added features which differentiates his trade mark from the name of the generic drug or ingredient.\t  [Para 11]\n\nHeld that the trade mark of the Respondents NETMICIN is admittedly registered, and therefore, the Respondents have statutory right to use that trade mark. The Appellants have adopted their trade mark NETROMYCIN from the generic drug name Netilmicin.  It has come on record that the other manufacturers and traders of medicinal goods have also adopted trade marks with prefix NET to indicate the drug name  Netilmicin Sulfate and the suffix MICIN/MYCIN is common to pharmaceutical trade. Both the trade marks are used in respect of Netilmicin Sulfate and both the trade marks owe their origin to the said medicine name. Since there is commonality in origin, ingredient, composition and purpose, even if one drug is consumed for the other, there cannot be disastrous consequences. Also, it is to be noted that the Respondents goods are purchased in bulk by the hospitals and not by the common consumers, they are not sold over the counter. Whereas the Appellants goods are sold over the counter to the consumers. The manner in which the drug is administered and that the product of the Respondents is used only in the hospitals by the Doctors after carrying out sensitivity culture test, is enough to rule out any possibility of any confusion as the chemical used in both the products is same. Even if by mistake one is used for the other, no injury is likely to be suffered by the consumer or patient. Therefore, this circumstance coupled with the circumstance that both the trade marks are registered and that from the year 2003 the Respondents have been using its trade mark uninterruptedly dis-entitles the Plaintiffs-Appellants to interim injunction restraining defendants respondents from using is trade mark. \t\t [Para 11,12]\n\nSo far as the complaint in relation to the product insert is concerned, admittedly, the Respondents have changed the contents of the product insert. \t\t\t [Para 13]"

Once the said averment is made, it is not open for the plaintiff to go back on the said averment and thereafter now contend that it is not from 1961 but much prior thereto. This is significant because the proposed defendant No.2 in a suit filed in District Court, Mandaleshwar, in State of Madhya Pradesh has specifically made a plea that the user by them is from 1959 i.e. prior in point of time than the user by the plaintiff herein. In light of the averments made by the proposed defendant No.2, the plaintiffs in the present case are seeking to amend the suit by going further back in time to 1958. Such an amendment cannot be granted in favour of the plaintiffs in view of the admission on the part of the plaintiffs that they are using the mark from 1961. The statement made in the plaint on oath is the statement on solemn affirmation and it is treated as a statement of fact which is an admission of the particular set of facts by the plaintiff in the plaint and it is this case which is required to be proved by the plaintiff at the trial of the suit and the defendants are required to meet. Once substitution of the paragraph which contains admission that the user of the mark was from 1961 is permitted then obviously the plaintiff will be entitled to go back to 1958 and defeat the right which is created in favour of the proposed defendant No.2 to contend that they are prior user of the mark in point of time. Hence, the plaintiff cannot be permitted to amend the chamber summons as set out in the schedule thereto insofar as paragraphs 5 and 6 thereof are concerned.  [Para 20]"

Hence the use of that mark by the Defendant cannot per se be forbidden. It will have to be seen whether the use of the word \"Parle Confi\" (which includes the word Parle for confectionery items) would amount to any misrepresentation by the Defendant. Misrepresentation, if any, would result if the undiscerning public who would buy the Defendant's toffees, at best, think that it is of the Parle Group of Companies who manufacture confectioneries such as toffees, but under a different product name. The Plaintiff's sale of the confectioneries, even of toffees, would not be affected adversely by virtue of the Defendant selling its toffees under two other names.\n\nIf a third party were to manufacture toffees and include on its label the word \"Parle\" in any font he would, at once, be restrained by the Court from doing so. The Defendant's manufacture of the toffees coming from the Parle family as it does, is quite another matter. The Defendant certainly cannot use the precise mark of the Plaintiff since it is a separate legal entity. However only a reference to the word Parle, the trademark that which both the parties enjoyed due to their lineage from the family of Parle, as has been done by the Defendant, is \"stating no more than the truth\". Since the Defendant's product's name is entirely different, the words \"Parle Confi\" would at best include the additional truthful information that it is a division, which is confectionery division, of the Defendant which is otherwise a beverage manufacturing Company. As in the case of Anderson the words \"Parle Confi\" has merely the reference to the parent Company which the Defendant calls a house name. But the fact that the corporate name of the Defendant is Parle Agro Private Limited, it makes it clear that it does not refer to the Plaintiff or the Plaintiff's businesses.\n\nThere are, therefore, two concepts i.e. the \"product name\" or the \"brand name\" and the \"house name\". The parties' house name is Parle. Their various products have separate and distinct identification names and marks for each of their products. It is justifiably argued on behalf of the Defendant that a customer who walks into the store cannot ask for \"Parle\" to be sold. He will have to ask for Glucose, Monaco, Buttercup, Mintrox, etc.  (1989) R.P.C. 124 - Rel. on.  (1999) RPC 117 and 1998 PTC (18) - Ref. to. \t\t\t [Para 14,15]"

The ordinary customers are, therefore, impressed to believe that they are purchasing the products of the manufacturers which are one and the same. The imitation is so calculated that it may appear to be only a printing error between the words \"Ashok\" and \"Ashik\"; in fact and in reality it is not an error but a well-designed and well calculated strategy thought of by the defendant No.1. The phonetical similarity and the manner and the ink in which the competing letters and the words are written is also the same. A man of average intelligence with imperfect recollection is bound to be deceived, in a given case even an intelligent person is also likely to be mislead and may fall prey to passing off the goods of defendants as if they are the goods of the plaintiff.\n\nIn view of these aspects and circumstances and taking into account the reasoning adopted by the learned trial Judge, the plaintiff has succeeded in establishing a prima facie case.\n\nThe interlocutory remedy is intended to preserve in status quo, the rights of parties which may appear on a prima facie case. The Court also, in restraining a defendant from exercising what he considers his legal right but what the plaintiff would like to be prevented, puts into the scales, as a relevant consideration whether the defendant has yet to commence his enterprise or whether he has already been doing so in which latter case considerations somewhat different from those that apply to a case where the defendant is yet to commence his enterprise, are attracted.  It must be remembered that an infringement action is available where there is violation of specific property right acquired under and recognised by the statute. In a passing-off action, however, the plaintiff's right is independent of such a statutory right to a trade mark and is against the conduct of the defendant which leads to or is intended or calculated to lead to deception. Passing-off is said to be a species of unfair trade and competition or of actionable unfair trading by which one person, through deception, attempts to obtain an economic benefit of the reputation which another has established for himself in a particular trade or business. The action is regarded an action for deceit. The tort of passing-off involves a misrepresentation made by a trader to his prospective customers calculated to injure, as a reasonably foreseeable consequence, the business or good-will of another which actually or probably, causes damages to the business or goods of the other trader. In view of this legal position applicable to the present set of facts, there is no doubt whatsoever that the plaintiffs are entitled to the  relief of temporary injunction and the learned trial Judge has rightly allowed the application while dismissing the similar application filed on behalf of the defendants.  1990(Supp) SCC 727 - Ref. to.\t [Para 18,19,21,23]"

                "description": "Protection under - Prior user of trade name in Hotel business by defendant - Also registration of defendant was in class 30 while plaintiff has been granted registration in class 42 - In said circumstances plaintiff cannot seek injunction.\n\nThe concept of registration trade mark in classes covering goods available under Schedule IV of the Trade Marks Act (1999) and concept of registration of trade mark in classes covering services available under Schedule IV to the said Act is required to be appreciated and there cannot be mixing of registration of trade mark for goods with service or mixing of services with goods. If the legislature intended to mix the said activity, there would not have been distinction as goods and services in Schedule IV.  In the instant case the Plaintiff has been granted registration in class 42 on the basis of order dated 25th August, 2008. However, the present Suit is filed on the basis of the registered trade mark held by the Plaintiff under class 30 and in the plaint there are no averments to show that the present suit is filed by relying upon the registration granted in favour of the Plaintiff vide class 42 by order dated 25th August, 2008. It is, in these circumstances, the stand taken by Defendant No.5 that activity of Defendant No.5 falls in class 42 and it cannot be compared with activity falling in class 30 is required to be accepted. On this principle even if the title of business of the Plaintiff, title of Defendant No.5 is Bhagat Tarachand, injunction sought by the Plaintiff cannot be granted. This point also covers the case of Defendant No.6.  The plea of the plaintiff that if certain proceedings are pending before the appropriate authority under the Act, the Court cannot extend the benefit of Section 34 is unsustainable, because irrespective of the proceedings which may be pending before the appropriate authority, it is open for the Court to consider the defence put up by a party as regards prior user of the trade name as that of the Plaintiff and if the case is made out and injunction can be refused.  [Para 30,32,36]\n\nThus, Reading the language of Section 34 as a whole, there is no prohibition on the Court to test the defence of the prior user. [Para 33]\n\nIn the instant case, Defendant No.5 has come out with a specific case that Defendant No.5 started business in the name of Bhagat Tarachand in the year 1978. Defendant No.5 has relied upon various particulars/documents for the purposes of making out the case of prior user since about 1978. A close perusal of these documents would clearly go to show that Defendant No.5 has been carrying on hotel business since 1978 in the name and style of Bhagat Tarachand. Surely, the documents which have been placed before the Court by Defendant No.5 cannot be disputed by the Plaintiff and at the stage of hearing and disposal of the Notice of Motion it is required to be seen as the one making out the case by Defendant No.5 viz. Defendant No.5 has been carrying on business in the name of Bhagat Tarachand since 1978. All this will clearly make out the case that stand taken out by Defendant No.5 that he is entitled to protection under Section 34 is required to be accepted.  [Para 35,36]\n\nMoreover, if the Plaintiff was serious in protecting her trade mark, nothing prevented the Plaintiff from instituting the present Suit at an early date. It is true that normally delay in approaching the Court is no ground to refuse injunction. However, in the present case, there is one more additional factor to hold against the Plaintiff on the ground of delay as Defendant Nos.5 and 6 have been carrying on their respective activity definitely prior to 1999 and the Plaintiff has approached the Court for injunction against Defendant Nos.1 to 6. If the Plaintiff would have approached the Court against Defendant No.1 alone, the question of delay would not have gone against her. The aforesaid discussion would clearly go to show that Defendant No.5 and Defendant No.6 were entitled to use the term Bhagat Tarachand, Radhomal Bhagat Tarachand or Rodhomal Bhagat Tarachand Bhojanalaya in accordance with the provision of Section 34 of the said Act. If this is so, Defendant No.5 and Defendant No.6 could grant licence as regards said user of the term Bhagat Tarachand in favour of a third party. In view of the licence granted in favour of Defendant No.1, Defendant No.1 is justified in using the said trade name and carry on the business. The argument advanced by the learned Counsel for Defendant Nos. 5 and 6 that if an injunction is not granted against Defendant Nos.5 and 6, injunction cannot be granted against Defendant No.1 who is carrying on business under the licence from Defendant No.5 and/or Defendant No.6 is required to be accepted.  For the reasons mentioned aforesaid, the Plaintiff has failed to make out the prima-facie case for grant of injunction prayed in Notice of Motion.\t\t [Para 49,50]"

                "description": "Registration of Trade mark - Plaintiff's trade mark registered prior to impugned mark being used by defendant - Not only plaintiff is entitled to injunction against infringement but he can never be restrained from using its trade mark.\n\nIn this case, On 19th October, 1992, the plaintiff applied for registration of its mark \"ROFOL\" under class 5. The application was made on the basis of its proposed use of the mark. On 14th August, 1995, the defendants applied for registration of the mark \"PROFOL\" under class 5 also on the basis of its proposed use of the mark. The defendants started using the impugned mark \"PROFOL\" from April, 1998. The plaintiffs started using the mark \"ROFOL\" from about 16th October, 2004, i.e. after the plaintiff's mark was registered. On 14th September, 2001, the plaintiffs application for registration of the mark \"ROFOL\" was allowed. The registration of the plaintiffs mark is, however, as of the date of the application i.e. 19th October, 1992. On 13th October, 2006, the plaintiff filed an opposition to the defendants application for registration of the impugned mark, which is pending. The main question, therefore, is whether the plaintiff is, by virtue of it's mark having been registered prior to the impugned mark being used by the defendant, entitled to an injunction against infringement although it used it's mark after the defendants started using the impugned mark.\n\nHeld the applicant's entitlement to registration of a trade mark has to be decided with reference to the facts as on the date of the application for registration and that the evidence of user by the opponents subsequent to the said date cannot be relevant and will not entitle them to put forward the plea of user in answer to the earlier application for registration.\n\n(2007) 109 BLR, AIR 1958 Bom. 58, 2011(7) ALL MR 721, 2011 (4) Mah.L.J.71 - Rel. on.\n\nAIR 1965 Bom. 35 - Disting.\n\n1998 PTC 18 - Explained.  [Para 15]\n\nThe defendants explanation for adopting the mark is less than convincing. It is averred that the defendants or their predecessor in April, 1998, introduced the molecule propofol in India. Thus, it is not as if the defendants discovered the molecule. The molecule was known throughout the world. By the time the defendants allegedly introduced the molecule to India, the plaintiff had already applied for registration of its mark. If the defendants had taken a search of the register, they would have come to know of the plaintiff's mark. Their adoption despite the same would then be dishonest. If they took no search, their adoption would be negligent. Either way then, they must suffer an injunction.  [Para 26]\n\nThe mere fact that the mark was not used until 2004 does not establish either that the plaintiff abandoned the same or that it never had any intention on the date of the application of using it. A mere delay in the use of a mark does not ipso facto warrant a conclusion to this effect. This is not a case where the registration was renewed mechanically with no intention of ever using it. It is only upon the facts of each case that the Court can decide whether by reason of the non-user the plaintiffs mark loses its distinctiveness or if the trade drops out of its use or the mark has been allowed to die for non-user. In the facts of the present case, these requirements are not satisfied.  [Para 63]\n\nThe non-user of a mark pending registration cannot, at least, normally be held against the proprietor for any reason. It accounts for good business sense for a party to use a mark only after it is registered. The proprietor may understandably not want to run the risk of using the mark if it is ultimately not Neon Laboratories Limited Vs. Medical Technologies Ltd. registered. The reasons are obvious. The use of a mark involves enormous time, effort and expenses. The proprietor may understandably not want to incur the same unless he is certain that there is no impediment to its registration. This he can be at least reasonably certain of only upon the mark being registered.  [Para 64]\n\nFurther, often a mark is not used till the product to which it is to be applied is ready to be marketed. The ability to market a product is dependent upon a variety of events and requirements not the least of which are market research and development. Many large organizations have independent research and development divisions. The entitlement to market a product is also dependent upon a variety of factors such as obtaining statutory clearances and approvals. The trademark can well be thought of in contemplation of the sale of products or the provision of services under such marks. Thus, the mark would be applied to the products and in respect of services after some time.  [Para 65]\n\nThe submission that the plaintiff intended trafficking in the mark requires merely to be stated to be rejected. The above facts establish that the plaintiff always intended using the mark and, in fact, started using the same. There is nothing on record which even remotely suggests that the plaintiff intended trafficking in the mark. The plaintiff is a well established pharmaceutical company which uses several marks.

This is clear from section 28 itself. Section 30(2)(b) refers to conditions or limitations placed by the Registrar in respect of the registration granted by him which is in respect of a specific class or classes.\n\n When the Registrar considers an application for registration, he does so vis-a-vis the class under which the registration is sought. He then decides whether with respect to the goods or services falling under that class,the registration ought to be allowed and if so, whether it should be subject to any condition or limitation. The limitation or condition, if imposed, would then be with respect to the goods or services that fall under that class. The Registrar does not consider whether the registration of a mark sought under one class ought to be subject to a limitation or condition in view of the effect of the registration on goods or services under another class. This also follows from the fact that the exclusive right under section 28 to the registered proprietor of the trademark, inter-alia, to use the trademark is in relation to the goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered.

If the Court were to do this, it would have to make artificial distinctions from case to case based on whether or not the Court considers that a confusion arising out of the medicinal product in issue may or may not have disastrous effects on health and life. Such an approach is impermissible. An ostensibly innocuous medicinal preparation taken for an affliction which is not life threatening may yet result in a serious danger to life and health, where the drug is not manufactured under correct conditions. A consumer who desires to obtain a medicine even for an ordinary ailment is entitled to be sure that the drug that he purchases is of an assured character and quality. A manufacturer builds up a reputation for quality and standards assiduously over a length of time and an established mark assures to the consumer that the medicine which he has purchased is of a requisite quality that is associated with the mark. A less than strict standard cannot be applied on the hypothesis that the ailment which the drug is intended to treat is not life threatening, nor for that matter can the application of a lower standard be justified merely on the ground that the composition of the Plaintiff's product is the same as that of the Defendant and the confusion caused by mistaking one for the other would not result in a danger to health. Undoubtedly, where the competing drugs are meant to cure the same ailment but the compositions are different, mistaking one for the other may result in deleterious consequences. But, merely because the two competing marks are used for drugs with the same composition that would not justify applying a lower standard of scrutiny. For, even in such a case, the public interest lies in protecting the consumer against an unwary purchase of a deceptively similar product. The consumer must be protected against a reasonable possibility of confusion arising out of a deceptively similar mark.   [Para 14]"

The structure of the mark visually and phonetically must be borne in mind. The image which the Court must have is that of the quintessential common man. When the Judge looks at phonetics, the sound which accompanies the pronunciation of the mark is the sound of the mark to an ordinary purchaser bereft of the niceties of language. Structurally and phonetically FOL-V falls within that perilous zone where approximation to the mark of the Plaintiffs is close enough to be deceptively similar. It is, no answer to state that the Plaintiffs intend that the VITE in their mark is to be so pronounced as to rhyme with 'Vite' while the Defendant intends that the \"V\" in their mark has to be so pronounced as to rhyme with the 'V' in 'victory' and to then make a distinction between VITE and the V. The ordinary customer goes to a small shop of a Chemist and to him the distinction between FOLVITE on the one hand and FOL-V on the other is so thin as to almost be lacking in significance. It may well be that the manner in which the mark of the Plaintiffs is written in Devnagari may make the VITE in the mark resemble 'white'. But every customer in a multi lingual country such as India is not conversant with that script. An average consumer who asks for FOLVITE would fail to gauge the distinction when he is given a strip of tablets of FOL-V and that is what matters on the question of deceptive similarity.\n\nThe contention of the Defendant is that the mark FOLVITE is a combination of FOL which stands for folic acid and VIT which is an abbreviation for Vitamin. The theory propounded by the Defendant is that the Plaintiffs cannot assert a monopoly over folic acid on the one hand and Vitamin on the other by adding an \"e\" to an abbreviation of the two words. This argument of the Defendant clearly misses the point and there are several reasons why it cannot be accepted. First and foremost, the word FOLVITE has absolutely no meaning in the English language. It is an invented word. As the Supreme Court observed in Cadila, it is not right to take a part of a word and compare it with a part of another. Each word must be taken as a whole and compared as a whole with the other: \"It is not right to take a portion of the word and say that because that portion of the word differs from the corresponding portion of the word in the other case, there is no sufficient similarity to cause confusion.\"\n\nSecondly, it is a settled principle of law that so long as a mark continues on the Register, it is not open to the Defendant in an action for infringement to question the validity of the registration.

A generic or common descriptive term is one which is used as the name or description of  the kind of goods. It obviously cannot become a trademark under any circumstances, since it fails altogether in distinguishing the goods of one trader from those of another. A merely descriptive term specifically describes one or other characteristic or ingredient of goods. Such a term is also ordinarily not registrable as trademark, unless it has, by acquiring a secondary meaning, i.e. becoming distinctive of the goods of the applicant for registration, become a valid trade mark. A suggestive term, unlike a descriptive term, suggests rather than describes an ingredient or characteristic of the goods. It still requires the observer or listener to use his own imagination and perception to determine the nature of the goods. Such a term is capable of being registered without proof of a secondary meaning. The Registrar may, however, put the applicant to certain terms as regards the user, or require a disclaimer from the latter, so far as a permissible descriptive or suggestive term is concerned. An arbitrary or fanciful term such as an invented word enjoys the fullest protection along the spectrum. It is most likely to distinguish the goods of the applicant from the goods of others and is the best placed of all terms as regards registrability. It is next to be noted that if a trademark, for which protection is sought to be claimed, lies at a particular place along the spectrum of trademarks referred to above, the applicant cannot successfully claim to alter that place (and put it on a higher end of the spectrum) by simply using a phonetic equivalent, say by misspelling it. A generic or common descriptive word, say 'table', cannot be misspelt as 'tabel' so as to rid the word of its quality of being a common descriptive or generic word. \t [Para 4,5]"

But the internet has developed from a mere means of communication to a mode of carrying on commercial activity. With the increase of commercial  activity on the internet, a domain name is also used as a business identifier. Therefore, the domain name not only serves as an address for internet communication but also identifies the specific internet site. In the commercial field, each domain name owner provides information/ services which are associated with such domain name. Thus a domain name may pertain to provision of services within the meaning of Section 2(z). A domain name is easy to remember and use, and is chosen as an instrument of commercial enterprise not only because it facilitates the ability of consumers to navigate  the internet to find  websites they are looking for, but also at the same time, serves to identify and distinguish the business itself, or its goods or services, and to specify its corresponding online internet location [Intellectual Property and the Internet - RODNEY D RYDER - Page 96 to 97].  Consequently a domain name as an address must, of necessity, be peculiar and unique and where a domain name is used in connection with a business, the value of maintaining an exclusive identity becomes critical.\t [Para 12]\n\nAn action for passing off, as the phrase 'passing off' itself suggests, is to restrain the defendant from passing off its goods or services to the public as that of the plaintiff's. It is an action not only to preserve the reputation of the plaintiff but also to safeguard the public. The defendant must have sold its goods or offered its services in a manner which has deceived or would be likely to deceive the public into thinking that the defendant's goods or services are the plaintiff's. The action is normally available to the owner of a distinctive trademark and the person who, if the word or name is an invented one, invents and uses it. If two trade rivals claim to have individually invented the same mark, then the trader who is able to establish prior user will succeed.   [Para 13]\n\nThe use of the same or similar domain name may lead to a diversion of users which could result from such users mistakenly accessing one domain name instead of another. This may occur in e-commerce  with its rapid progress and instant (and theoretically limitless) accessibility to users and potential  customers and particularly so in areas of specific overlap. Ordinary  consumers/ users seeking to locate the functions available under one domain name may be confused if they accidentally arrived at a different but similar web site which offers no such services. Such users  could well conclude that the first domain name owner had mis-represented its goods or services through its promotional activities and the first domain owner would thereby lose their customer. It is apparent therefore that a domain name may have all the characteristics of a trademark and could found an action for passing off.  [Para 16]\n\nA trademark is protected by the laws of a country where such trademark may be registered. Consequently, a trade mark may have multiple registration in many countries  throughout the world. On the other hand since the internet allows for access without any geographical limitation, a domain name is potentially accessible  irrespective of the geographical location of the consumers. The outcome of this potential for universal connectivity is not only that a domain name would require world wide exclusivity but also that national laws might be inadequate to effectively protect a domain name.

Perusal of the registration shows that numeral \"5000\" is not disclaimed. What is disclaimed is the descriptive material on the label. Whenever numeral in the lable or trade mark is disclaimed, it is clear from the material available on record that it was specifically so mentioned, and therefore, it is clear from the material available on record that so far as the registration of the lable of \"HAYWARDS 5000\" is concerned, the numeral has not been disclaimed, and therefore, in view of the registration of the trade-mark and the lable, the Plaintiffs will have a statutory right to prevent the Defendants from using a deceptively similar mark.\n\nMoreso, the Defendants have, while entering into an agreement with the Plaintiffs which are on record, admitted that the Brand \"HAYWARDS 5000\" is a well-known brand and that the Defendants have no right and are not entitled to question the popularity or the suitability of the brand.\n\nFrom the material available on record it is clear that the Defendants were aware, when they adopted their brand about the popularity of the registered trade mark of the Petitioners, and therefore, it prima facie appears that the adoption of the impugned trade-mark by the Defendants was dishonest and they adopted the trade mark to take advantage of the popularity of the trade-mark of the Plaintiffs, and therefore, as there is no disclaimer of the numeral \"5000\" at the time of registration of the trade-mark and as the numeral \"5000\" is an essential part of the registered trade lable of the Plaintiffs, the Plaintiffs will prima facie have a statutory right to prevent the Defendants from using a deceptively similar trade lable and trade mark. The Plaintiffs would be entitled to a temporary injunction also because it prima facie appears that the adoption of the impugned mark by the Defendants appears to be dishonest.\n\nHence, inspite of the fact that the statement made in paragraph 3 of the plaint that on the date on which the suit was filed nobody else was using the numeral \"5000\" in respect of the beer is an incorrect statement made by the Plaintiffs.\n\nBut still for that reason alone the relief of temporary injunction cannot be denied to the Plaintiff, because an order of temporary injunction in a suit for infringement or passing off is to be made not only to protect the right of the Plaintiff, but also to protect the interest of the general public.\n\nAn order of temporary injunction is to be made so that the public who buys the goods involved is not deceived or misled. Therefore, had the purpose of granting temporary injunction been only to protect the interest of the Plaintiffs, then may be the temporary injunction could have been denied to the Plaintiffs, because the Plaintiffs have made an incorrect statement in the plaint. But as the purpose of granting temporary injunction in a suit for infringement of trade-mark or trade label is not only to protect the interest of the Plaintiffs, but also to protect the interest of the general public, denial of temporary injunction to the Plaintiffs merely because the Plaintiffs have made incorrect statement in the plaint would not be in the interest of justice.

Similarity in two marks is so striking that added material does not distract from deceptive similarity.

The registration granted by the Registrar under section 45 is proof of title to the trade mark of the assignee or the person who acquires the same by transmission. Thus a person who has acquired title to a trade mark by assignment or transmission cannot be non-suited for want of title per se on the ground that the assignment or transmission is not entered on the register. This is clear from the plain language of section 45 (1). The opening words : \"Where a person becomes entitled by assignment or transmission to a registered trade mark ...\" posit the acquisition of title thereto by assignment or transmission. This is further clear from sub-section (1) which requires the Registrar to register the title of a person who acquires the trade mark by assignment or transmission \"on proof of title\". Thus the acquisition of title to a trade mark by assignment or transmission precedes and is essential to an application under section 45. There is a distinction between an unregistered document not affecting the property which is the subject matter thereof and such a document not being inadmissible in evidence. It is important to note that section 45 does not provide that a document of the nature referred to in sub-section (2) does not affect the trade mark acquired by assignment or transmission. This is in contrast to section 49 of the Registration Act which provides that no document required to be registered under section 17 thereof or under the Transfer of Property Act shall \"affect\" any immovable property comprised therein.

If strong prima facie case of infringement of Trade Mark is not made out, one cannot ignore the policy of law e.g. the Competition Act (12 of 2003) to promote healthy competition amongst traders and sustain it for industrial growth by controlling monopolies, preventing practices having adverse effect on competition and to serve social and economic justice, changing policy of law may be relevant to decide motion for injunction by exercise of sound judicial discretion. Likelihood of confusion or deception in the present case is ruled out as buyers of packaged drinking water belong to a class of its own, mostly belonging to middle or upper class, fairly educated using due diligence, knowing what he or she is going to buy, but may not have clear recollection as to which product he or she had bought earlier or what had been advertised for sale of drinking water in packaged bottles. The terms \"Oxygen\" is common and is known as H2O in Chemistry and consequently the plaintiffs cannot claim any exclusive title to use the word \"OXY\" by reason of their having partly used it for labeling their product since the registration of the Trade Mark. Phonetic and visual similarity or dissimilarity will play pivotal role to distinguish one mark from the other. Reading and comparing getup and variations of the script style, arrangement of words, fonts on labels used by the plaintiffs and the defendants would certainly overrule the possibility of any average buyer from being deceived in to assuming connection between the \"OXYRICH\" and \"OXYCOOL\" on assuming that they enumerated from same source. Label of defendants is good and distinctly indicate that packaged drinking water do not originate from the plaintiffs but have been produced by the defendants giving their detailed address and ISI mark for quality. Two marks when placed side by side may exhibit various differences on comparison. Marks are remembered by general or some significant details than by photographic recollection of the whole. The plaintiff No.1 must prima facie demonstrate that the Trade Mark owned by him has acquired goodwill and reputation attached to the term \"MANIKCHAND OXYRICH\" (in this case) in the mind of the purchasers and furthermore that the defendants goods have misrepresented or confused such purchasers leading them to believe that \"OXYCOOL\" packaged drinking water offered by the defendants is same as that manufactured and supplied by the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs must also demonstrate that due to use of the Trade Mark \"OXYCOOL\" by defendants, the sale of the plaintiffs' product have diminished since the defendants started selling \"OXYCOOL\".\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 12]"

There must be relevant prima facie material to support the exercise of discretion of granting interim injunction. The plaintiffs/respondents have not brought to our notice any document indicating diminishing profits in their account due to the alleged infringement and user of their Trade Mark by the defendants. Unless it is prima facie shown that the plaintiffs have suffered actual losses due to the alleged unlawful acts of the defendants using or infringing their Trade Mark, grant of interim injunction can not be justified as speculative or unproven damages can not be considered. No prima facie case is made out to establish that the defendants have infringed the copyright of the artistic work titled as \"MANIKCHAND OXYRICH HEALTHY DRINKING WATER\" by using \"OXYCOOL\" Trade Mark to sell mineral water/packaged drinking water in view of the distinguishing features between the Trade marks claimed by the plaintiffs and the defendants respectively.

                "description": "Infringement of trade mark - Difference between applicability of sub-section (4) and (5) of Trade Marks Act - Sub-section (4) applies when a mark is used during course of trade in relation to dissimilar goods or services - Whereas sub-section (5) applies specifically to case where registered trade mark is used as a part of business/corporate name provided business of infringer is of dealing with goods or services in respect of which trade mark is registered - Thus, sub-section (4) applies in \"Trade Mark versus Mark\" situation - Whereas sub-section (5) applies to Trade Mark versus Trade/Corporate/Business name\" situation - Interpretation of both the sub-sections given.\n\n\tSub-Section (5) applies when a person uses a registered trade mark as his trade name or part of his trade name or name of his business concern or part of the name of his business concern provided his trade or business is of dealing with goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered. If both the conditions are satisfied, it is not necessary to prove anything further for establishing the infringement. It is not necessary to prove that the use of trade mark as a trade or business name is likely to cause any confusion on the part of the public. It is not necessary to prove that such user takes unfair advantage or such use is detrimental to the distinctive character of the registered trademark or its repute. Therefore, Delhi High Court in the case of Bloomberg has rightly described the provision of Sub-Section (5) as \"no fault provision\". This provision is distinct from Sub-Section (4). To attract this Sub-Section, the person who infringes the trade mark should be doing trade or business in goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered. Sub-Section (4) applies when the person against whom allegation of infringement is made uses a mark in relation to goods or services which are not similar to those for which the trade mark is registered. Sub-Section (4) does not refer to use of a registered trade mark as a part of corporate/trade/business name. It applies when a mark is used during the course of trade in relation to dissimilar goods or services. Sub-section (5) applies specifically to a case where the registered trade mark is used as a part of business/corporate name provided the business of the infringer is of dealing with the goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered.\n\n\tThe Sub-Section (4) uses the words \"in the course of trade\" and \"in relation to goods or services\" which are absent in Sub-Section (5). The Sub-Section(5) uses the words \"......... if he uses such registered trade mark, as his trade name or part of his trade name, or name of his business concern or part of the name, of his business concern..\" These words are conspicuously absent in the Sub-Section (4). The difference in the phraseology and language used in the two Sub-Sections makes it c-lear that Sub-Section (4) applies in \"trade mark versus mark\" situation. It applies when the mark is used in the course of trade in relation to goods and services. Sub-Section (5) applies to a \"trade mark versus trade/corporate/business name\" situation. It is a special provision which is different from Sub-Sections (1), (2) and (4). Thus, Sub-Sections (4) and (5) apply to different situations arising out of use of a mark. Sub-Section (5) does not make Sub-Section (4) otiose. The fact that the definition of the word \"mark\" includes \"name\" is of no consequence while interpreting Sub-Sections (4) and (5). If we hold that Sub-Section (4) will apply to those cases where the first condition -of Sub-Section (5) is satisfied but second one is not satisfied, the requirement specifically incorporated in Sub-Section (4) of the mark being used in relation to goods and services will become redundant. A statute cannot be interpreted in such a manner. The use of trade mark as a part of corporate/business/trade name cannot be read into Sub-Section (4).\t [Para 25,27]"

Under Sub-Section (1), a registered trade mark is infringed by a person who, not being a registered proprietor or a person using by way of permitted use, (i) uses in the course of trade, a mark which is identical with, or deceptively similar to the trade mark, (ii) in relation to goods or services in respect of which the trade mark is registered and (iii) in such manner as to render the use of the mark likely to be taken as being used as a trade mark. Thus, to attract Sub-Section (1), there has to be the use of a mark during the course of trade which is identical to the registered trademark or deceptively similar to the registered trademark. Use of such mark becomes infringement provided it is used in relation to the goods or services for which the trademark is registered in such a manner that the use of the mark is likely to be taken as being used as a trademark.\n\n\tSub-Section (2) is applicable when a person who, not being a registered proprietor or a person using by way of permitted use, uses in the course of trade, a mark (a) which is likely to cause confusion on the part of the public, or (b) which is likely to have an association with the registered trade mark due to (i) its identity with the registered trade mark and the similarly of the goods or services covered by such registered trade mark or, (ii) its similarly to the registered trade mark and the identity or similarly of the goods or services covered by such registered trade mark, or (iii) its identity with the registered trade mark and the identity of the goods or services covered by such registered trade mark. If a case falls in clause (c) of Sub-Section (2), in view of Sub-Section (3), it will have to be presumed that it is likely to cause confusion on the part of the public.\n\n\tNow, coming to Sub-Sections (1) and (2), the same apply on its plain meaning only to \"trade mark versus mark\" situation. Both the sub-sections use the words \"uses in the course of trade\". They do not refer to use of trade mark as a part of corporate/trade/business name. Both the sub-sections do not apply when use of a registered trade mark is made by the Defendant as a part of trade/corporate/ business name.\t\t\t\t [Para 21,22,31]"

By no stretch of imagination can they be termed as descriptive. The disclaimer condition of registration of trade mark bearing No.436744 in Class 32 viz. \"Registration of said trade mark shall give no right to the exclusive use of all descriptive matters appearing on the label\" therefore, would not apply to the said essential and distinctive features. A Disclaimer is the antithesis of an essential particular of a trade mark. It is therefore, clear that the disclaimer imposed by the Registrar in relation to the Plaintiff's trade mark HAYWARDS 5000 bearing registration No.436744 in Class 32 did not pertain to the numeral 5000. Had the Registrar intended to impose a disclaimer on the numeral \"5000\", he would have specifically done so.

In the present case the dominant characteristic of the mark which has been adopted by the Defendant is the prefix \"VONI\" which occurs before the \"GEL\". To the average purchaser with an average intelligence, the mark VONIGEL must appear deceptively similar to the mark VOLINI of which the Plaintiff is the registered proprietor. The average purchaser is liable to be confused into assuming that the product under the mark VONIGEL which is sold by the Defendant is in fact, the product of the Plaintiff sold under the mark VOLINI. The words VOLINI and VONI are deceptively similar, the only distinction being the deletion of the letters \"LI\" in the mark of the Defendant. Undoubtedly, both the marks have to be considered as a whole. In doing so, the average purchaser is liable to place a much greater degree of emphasis on the word \"VONI\" as it appears in the mark of the Defendant leading to a deceptive degree of similarity with the mark of the Plaintiff. A prima facie case of infringement has, therefore, been established. \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 9]"

The mark of the Defendant is deceptively similar. The Defendant uses the same colour combination. The Plaintiff's cartons contain a description to the effect that the preparation is \"For quick relief from pain, swelling and inflammation\". The same description appears on the carton of the Defendant, word for word. The Plaintiff's carton represents the product to be \"A Multi Action Topical Gel\". The Defendant's carton contains an identical representation. The carton of the Plaintiff contains four line diagrams containing a thematic illustration of the efficacy of the product in treating of (i) low back pain; (ii) joint pain; (iii) sprains and strains; and (iv) muscular pain. The Defendant has adopted an almost identical depiction of a person suffering from the same four conditions. The Plaintiff's carton contains a depiction of a human being involving in the process of running. The Defendant has chosen to adopt a logo in the same colour as that of the Plaintiff -Orange- and it is no answer to submit, as did Counsel appearing on behalf of the Defendant, that the logo of the Defendant is of a 'dancing man' as opposed to the logo of the Plaintiff which is of 'a running man'. Such niceties may provide interesting trivia in a 'spot the difference in the pictures' contest but do not constitute a valid test in trade mark law. Trade mark law postulates the protection of a purchaser as average as the common citizen who goes about his daily chores. Trade mark law must also protect the just proprietary rights of manufacturers. Unless such a protection is afforded, the goodwill and reputation associated with an established mark ceases to be distinctive of the goods which it purveys. A rapidly advancing industrial economy as in India can ill afford such invasions. It may well be that some of the representations which are made on the carton of the Plaintiff are descriptive of the condition which the product is intended to treat. There can be no monopoly on the description of an ailment which a pharmaceutical preparation is intended to treat. The Court must, however, look at the entirety of the depiction. Doing so leads the Court prima facie to the irresistible inference that what is being done by the Defendant is to replicate the representation made by the Plaintiff. The word mark, colour scheme, layout and get up adopted by the Defendant are deceptively similar.  1982 PTC 335 - Ref. to.\t [Para 13]"

The concept of continuous use emphasises that a right vests in a person when he puts his goods with the mark in the market. A use which is continuous is distinct from a use which is stray, isolated or disjointed. The notion of a continuous use establishes that a mere adoption of a mark is not sufficient. The legislation mandates that in order to avail of the benefit of Section 34 a test of a high order must be fulfilled which requires a commercially continuous use of the mark in relation to goods or services. Section 34 thus provides for specific requirements which relate to (i) the nature of the goods or services in relation to which the mark is used; (ii) the nature and character of use; (iii) the person who must use; and (iv) the date from which the mark should have been used. Section 2(2)(b) provides that in the Act, unless the context otherwise requires, any reference to the use of a mark is to be construed as a reference to the use of printed or other visual representation of the mark. Any reference to the use of a mark in relation to goods shall be construed as a reference to the use of the mark upon or in any physical or in any other relation whatsoever, to such goods.

It isclear therefore that the application for rectification of the register referred to in Section 125(1) could only be an application (given the facts of the present case) by the defendant in the suit for infringement. The defendant being Seagram (Subsidiary company in India) and not Austin Nichols (Holding company in U.S.A.), it is clear that the Section 125 would have no application.\n\nIt may also be noticed that the suit is both a suit for infringement as well as passing off, and it is significant that Austin Nichols has not been made a party defendant to the said suit. Also, the very issue as to validity of the registration of the trademark concerned has tobe determined in the application for rectification of the register,which would obviously bind only the parties to the suit and nobody else. For these reasons, the application for rectification, not having been made by any of the party defendants in the said suit for infringement and passing off,Section 125(1) would have no application.

The reason is not hard to seek. If the Registrar is barred from undertaking a suo motu exercise under Section 57(4) to maintain the purity of the register, there could conceivably be cases where a defendant, after raising the plea of invalidity in a suit for infringement, chooses not to proceed with the filing of a rectification petition before the Appellate Board. This may happen in a variety of circumstances: for example, take the case where, after raising the plea of invalidity in a suit for infringement, the matter is compromised and the defendant therefore does not file a rectification petition before the Appellate Board. The Registrar's power to maintain the purity of the register of trademarks would still remain intact even insuch cases. \n\n(2003) 11 SCC 92 Rel. on.  [Para 25]\n\nThe contention that the non obstante clause in Section 125 refers to the whole of Section 57 including the suo motu power of the Registrar contained in Section 57(4), also not tenable. In Section 125(1) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999, the width of the expression \"Section 57\" is cut down by the expression \"and an application for rectification of the register\". Such rectification applications are referable only to Sections 57(1) and (2) and not to the suo motu power of the Registrar under Section 57(4). Therefore, apart from the substantive reason given above of maintaining the purity of the register, even on a literal construction of Section 125(1), it is clear that Section 57 (4) would have to be excluded.\n\n(1998) 8 SCC 1 Disting.

Such \"low threshold prima facie case\" may be sufficient for the defendant to get an opportunity under Section 124(1) and (2) of the 1999 Act to get the trial of the suit stayed for the purpose of enabling the defendant to apply to the Appellate Board for rectification.

There are advertisements daily and 'construction' companies or enterprises abound. Many use the names - proper nouns or surnames. In this crowded field of builders jostling for projects, some, using their names, have acquired considerable goodwill and a reputation for standards and quality. Their names are uniquely associated with the construction and with a certain class or classes of housing: Mittal, Raheja, Lodha are among these. So, too, is Lokhandwala. The word \"Lokhandwala\", the name used by the Plaintiffs, has now come to describe a geographical area in Mumbai's suburbs. This was a township developed by the Plaintiffs themselves. There is in the public mind and imagination an association of that area with the name of the Plaintiffs. Defendants' use of the name is not entirely innocent.\n\n Moreover, this is an action in passing off, and there may be third parties who assume that the Defendants' constructions are in fact those of the Plaintiffs, and consequently alter their circumstances to their detriment. This necessitates at least some level of relief. Those who purchase properties are members of a discerning class who would be capable of distinguishing between the two. This is the purest speculation. While such buyers do often conduct their own due diligences, it hard to believe that this would necessarily include an investigation of precisely which Lokhandwala they are dealing with, particularly if there is a common public association with one of them and not the other. The material annexed to the Affidavit in Reply does not also indicate the kind of recognition or public awareness that might enable third party purchasers to easily tell one from the other. A flat purchaser would first be drawn by the fact that the proposed construction is \"by Lokhandwala\", assuming quite understandably that this is a project by the Plaintiffs. It would be wholly unrealistic to expect every flat purchaser to then minutely scrutinize material and to be able to tell from, say, one of a raft of names that might be used by the Defendants that this is not after all a project by the Plaintiffs but by their rivals. When we speak of 'confusion' or 'deception' in the context of passing off - and indeed, the very expression 'passing off' itself - all suggest that the overarching consideration is not merely an individual proprietory rights or claims but of the public interest. How will a consumer view the rival marks? Will he or she readily be able to tell one from the other? Is he or she likely to confuse the two rival users? If so, then an injunction must follow.\n\n2002 (24) PTC 121 (SC) Foll.       [Para 14,15,16,17,18]"

Actio quaelibet It sua via : Every action follows its prescribed course. The Committee in its 100th meeting while dealing with the agenda Item 4-A passed the resolution, of course, on the given facts and while noticing that the resolutions passed in the earlier meetings were not in the interest of the Committee and that the withdrawal of administrative power of the Secretary was not fully justified. But when taking financial decision it have declared the Secretary of the Committee to be head of the department, controlling officer and sanctioning authority. It further resolved and decided that the financial powers of the Committee were delegated amongst the Secretary, Vice Secretary and the Chairman as per the details mentioned in the Annexure which means that the financial powers have been delegated to the Secretary of the Committee. It apparently offends Rules 33 to 35 of the relevant Rules. As Rule 34 does not permit delegation of financial powers exercisable under Rule 33(1) to any other person except Chairman or Vice-Chairman, the Respondents cannot take any benefit of Section 14 as that is the general provision while Rules 33 to 35 are special provisions. These special provisions relate to exercise of financial powers and by specific language prohibit delegation of powers to any other person by the Committee except the Chairman or the Vice-Chairman. Such an action of the Respondent-Committee would be in violation to the specific rules. \n\nThe Central Government exercises great control over the Committee. The concerned Ministry is competent to overlook functioning of the Committee and ensure that its functions and duties are being performed in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The Central Government in furtherance to the Rules and Regulations framed had issued certain directions which may be binding on the Committee but it will be so only if such instructions were in consonance with the provisions of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder. Assumption of powers by any authority or forum including the Government and/or the Committee itself cannot be justified in the eyes of law. Defined powers can be exercised only by the authority which is duly empowered to act under the relevant provisions. Assumption of power on the plea that it was in the interest of administration to do so cannot be sustained in law when the exercise of delegated powers is apparently contrary to the specific provision. \n\nWhatever be the circumstances, the law must prevail and every authority in the hierarchy of the Committee should act in accordance with law. The provisions of Section 14 and Rules 33 to 35 clearly command that the Respondents cannot pass the impugned resolution. The resolution is in violation of these Rules and thus cannot be permitted to stand. AIR 1989 SC 1582 - Ref. to.  [Para 19]"

Once these statutory posts are handled by duly appointed persons, then the Secretary of the Committee cannot be termed as head of the department in terms of Rules 34 and 35. He has to work under the general control of the Chairman and in his absence under the Vice Chairman. A person who is, by specific language of the provision and even under the scheme of the Act and the Rules framed thereunder is subordinate to another officer then such a subordinate officer cannot be head of the department when that higher officer/official is holding the higher post. There is a definite hierarchy contemplated under the provisions of the Act and executive direction or resolution cannot be passed which will be contrary to the specific provisions of the Act.

The pure theory of law, according to eminent positivist jurist Kelsen requires that once the principal legislation or statutory rules though may be inferior to the principal act would have precedence over any other regulation or orders issued in exercise of its executive power. Thus, nothing could be done by executive orders or by resolution by the Committee which would offend or being in conflict with the statutory provisions. (2005)10 SCC 244 - Ref. to. [Para 14]"

                "description": "Relief to consumers for call drops - At the rate of Re.1/- for each call drop - Constitutional validity of 2015 Regulations - Whether impugned Regulations suffer from \"manifest arbitrariness\" or fall within category of \"reasonable restriction\" - Technical Report shows that average of 36.9% of call drops occur due to fault of consumer himself - However, impugned Regulation is based on 100% fault of service provider i.e. service provider is made liable even if he is not at fault - Held, impugned Regulations framed without any intelligent care and deliberation - Therefore, violative of Arts.14 and 19 of Constitution.\n\nIt is important to note that, apart from the common good in the form of consumer interest, the Regulation must also pass a separate and independent test of not being manifestly arbitrary or unreasonable. When viewed from the angle of manifest arbitrariness or reasonable restriction, sounding in Article 14 and Article 19(1)(g) respectively, the Regulation must, in order to pass constitutional muster, be a result of intelligent care and deliberation, that is, the choice of a course which reason dictates. Any arbitrary invasion of a fundamental right cannot be said to contain this quality. A proper balance between the freedoms guaranteed and the control permitted under Article 19(6) must be struck in all cases before the impugned law can be said to be a reasonable restriction in the public interest.\n\nThe cause for call drops is twofold - one owing to the fault of the consumer, and the other owing to the fault of the service provider. When the technical paper dated 13.11.2015 is referred to, it shows that an average of 36.9% can be call drops owing to the fault of the consumer. If this is so, the Impugned Regulation's very basis is destroyed: the Regulation is based on the fact that the service provider is 100% at fault. This becomes clear from a reading of the text of the said Regulation together with the Explanatory Memorandum set out hereinabove. This being the case, it is clear that the service provider is made to pay for call drops that may not be attributable to his fault, and the consumer receives compensation for a call drop that may be attributable to the fault of the consumer himself, and that makes the Impugned Regulation a regulation framed without intelligent care and deliberation.\n\nIn the present case, a mandatory penalty is payable by the service provider for call drops that may take place which are not due to its fault, and may be due to the fault of the recipient of the penalty, which is violative of Articles 14 and 19(1)(g).\n\nThe reason given in the Explanatory Memorandum for compensating the consumer is that the compensation given is only notional. The very notion that only notional compensation is awarded, is also entirely without basis. A consumer may well suffer a call drop after 3 or 4 seconds in a voice call. Whereas the consumer is charged only 4 or 5 paise for such dropped call, the service provider has to pay a sum of rupee one to the said consumer. This cannot be called notional at all. It is also not clear as to why the Authority decided to limit compensation to three call drops per day or how it arrived at the figure of Re.1 to compensate inconvenience caused to the consumer. It is equally unclear as to why the calling party alone is provided compensation because, according to the Explanatory Memorandum, inconvenience is suffered due to the interruption of a call, and such inconvenience is suffered both by the calling party and the person who receives the call. The receiving party can legitimately claim that his inconvenience when a call drops, is as great as that of the calling party. And the receiving party may need to make the second call, in which case he receives nothing, and the calling party receives Re.1 for the additional expense made by the receiving party. All this betrays a complete lack of intelligent care and deliberation in framing such a regulation by the Authority, rendering the Impugned Regulation manifestly arbitrary and unreasonable.\n\nIn a technical paper issued by the same Authority on 13.11.2015 i.e. a few days after the Impugned Regulation, the Authority has itself recognised that 36.9% of call drops take place because of the fault at the consumer's end. Instead of having a relook at the problem in the light of the said technical paper, the Authority has gone ahead with the Impugned Regulation, which states that the said Regulation has been brought into force because of deficiency of service in service providers leading to call drops. The very basis of this statement contained in the Explanatory Memorandum to the Impugned Regulation is found by the self-same Authority to be incorrect only a few days after publishing the Impugned Regulation. This itself shows the manifest arbitrariness on the part of the TRAI, which has not bothered to have a relook into the said problem. For all the aforesaid reasons, the Impugned Regulation is found to be manifestly arbitrary and therefore violative of Article 14, and is an unreasonable restriction on the service providers' fundamental right under Article 19(1)(g) to carry on business, and therefore liable to be struck down as such.\n\n(1996) 10 SCC 304, (2002) 2 SCC 188, (1970) 1 SCC 248, 1950 SCR 759, (2016) 3 SCC 643 Ref. to.

The language of the Impugned Regulation is definite and unambiguous - every service provider has to credit the account of the calling consumer by one rupee for every single call drop which occurs within its network. The Explanatory Memorandum to the aforesaid Regulation further makes it clear, in paragraph 19 thereof, that the Authority has come to the conclusion that call drops are instances of deficiency in service delivery on the part of the service provider. It is thus unambiguously clear that the Impugned Regulation is based on the fact that the service provider is alone at fault and must pay for that fault. In these circumstances, to read a proviso into the Regulation that it will not apply to consumers who are at fault themselves is not to restrict general words to a particular meaning, but to add something to the provision which does not exist, which would be nothing short of the court itself legislating. For this reason, it is not possible to apply the doctrine of reading down on the Impugned Regulations of 2015.\t [Para 33,35,36,37]"

                "description": "Validity of 2017 Rules - Rules suffering from various infirmities, contradictions and inconsistencies - Struck down in entirety.\nFollowing contradictions in the 2017 Rules have been observed:\n(a) There is an inconsistency within the Rules with regard to the tenure prescribed for the Members of Tribunals insofar as a fixed tenure of three years for both direct appointments from the Bar and appointment of retired judicial officers or judges of High Court or Supreme Court. It is also discriminatory to the extent that it attempts to create equality between unequal classes. The tenure of Members, Vice-Chairman, Chairman, etc. must be increased with due consideration to the prior decisions of the Court.\n(b) The difference in the age of superannuation of the Members, Vice-Chairmen and Chairmen, as formulated in the Rules is contrary to the objectives of the Finance Act, 2017 viz., to attain uniformity in the composition of the Tribunal framework. There should be a uniform age of superannuation for Members, Vice-Chairmen, Chairmen, etc. in all Tribunals.\n(c) Rule 4(2) of the Rules providing that the Secretary to the Government of India in the Ministry or Department under which the Tribunal is constituted shall be the convener of the Search-cum-Selection Committee, is in direct violation of the doctrine of Separation of Powers and thus contravenes the basic structure of the Constitution. Corollary to the dictum of this Court in the Fourth Judges Case, judicial dominance in appointment of members of judiciary cannot be diluted by the Executive.\n(d) Rule 7 accords unwarranted discretion to the Central Government insofar as it merely directs and not mandates the Central Government to consider the recommendation of Committee for removal of a Member of a Tribunal. The Central Government shall mandatorily consider the recommendation of the Committee before removal of any Member of Tribunal. Furthermore, the proviso to Rule 7 creates an unjust classification between National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT) and other fora inasmuch as the removal of Chairperson or member of NCLAT alone is to be in consultation with the Chief Justice of India.\n(e) Moral turpitude is a term well defined by this Court in numerous decisions. Rule 7(b) cannot be allowed to survive as it allows the Executive to interpret the meaning of \u2018moral turpitude\u2019, which is an encroachment on the judicial domain.\n(f) The power of relaxation of rules with respect to any class of persons shall be vested with the Search-cum-Selection Committee and not with the Central Government as provided under Rule 20. As ruled by this Court earlier in Madras Bar Association (2014), the Central Government cannot be allowed to have administrative control over the Judiciary without subverting the doctrine of separation of powers. \n(2014) 10 SCC 1 Ref. to. (Para 179)\nThe Tribunal, Appellate Tribunal and other Authorities (Qualifications, Experience and other Conditions of Service of Members) Rules, 2017 suffer from various infirmities as observed earlier. These Rules formulated by the Central Government under Section 184 of the Finance Act, 2017 being contrary to the parent enactment and the principles envisaged in the Constitution as interpreted by this Court, are hereby struck down in entirety. \nThe Central Government is accordingly directed to re-formulate the Rules strictly in conformity and in accordance with the principles delineated by this Court in R.K. Jain (supra), L. Chandra Kumar (supra), Madras Bar Association (supra) and Gujarat Urja Vikas Ltd. (supra) conjointly read with the observations made in the earlier part of this decision. (Para 228)"

S.5 of J & K Constitution, S.140 of J & K TP Act has to give way to SAFAESI Act - SARFAESI Act held applicable to state of J & K.\n\n\tRule 8(5) Proviso of the Security Enforcement Rules makes it amply clear that Section 140 of the Transfer of Property Act of Jammu & Kashmir will be respected in auction sales that take place within the State. This being the case, it is clear that there is no collision or repugnancy with any of the provisions of SARFAESI, and therefore it is clear that in the instant case the High Court is absolutely wrong in finding that as Section 140 of the Transfer of Property Act will be infracted, SARFAESI cannot be held to apply to the State of Jammu & Kashmir. Rule 8 has been noticed but brushed aside by the aforesaid judgment. The High court judgment begins from the wrong end and therefore reaches the wrong conclusion. It states that in terms of Section 5 of the Constitution of Jammu & Kashmir, the State has absolute sovereign power to legislate in respect of laws touching the rights of its permanent residents qua their immovable properties. The State legislature having enacted Section 140 of the Jammu & Kashmir Transfer of Property Act, therefore, having clearly stated that the State's subjects/citizens are by virtue of the said provision protected, SARFAESI cannot intrude and disturb such protection. The whole approach is erroneous. As has been stated hereinabove, Entries 45 and 95 of List I clothe Parliament with exclusive power to make laws with respect to banking, and the entirety of SARFAESI can be said to be referable to Entry 45 and 95 of List I, 7th Schedule to the Constitution of India. This being the case, Section 5 of the Jammu & Kashmir Constitution will only operate in areas in which Parliament has no power to make laws for the State Thus, it is clear that anything that comes in the way of SARFAESI by way of a Jammu & Kashmir law must necessarily give way to the said law by virtue of Article 246 of the Constitution of India as extended to the State of Jammu & Kashmir, read with Section 5 of the Constitution of Jammu & Kashmir. This being the case, it is clear that Sections 13(1) and (4) cannot be held to be beyond the legislative competence of Parliament as has wrongly been held by the High Court.\n\nEven if it is found that Section 140 of the Jammu & Kashmir Transfer of Property Act entitles only certain persons to purchase properties in the State of Jammu & Kashmir, yet, as has been held hereinabove, Rule 8(5) proviso which recognizes this provision, has been brushed aside. In any case an attempt has first to be made to harmonise Section 140 of the Jammu & Kashmir Transfer of Property Act with SARFAESI, and if such harmonization is impossible, it is clear that by virtue of Article 246 read with Section 5 of the Jammu & Kashmir Constitution, Section 140 of the Jammu & Kashmir Transfer of Property Act has to give way to SARFAESI, and not the other way around.

In pith and substance, SARFAESI does not deal with \"transfer of property\". In fact, in so far as banks and financial institutions are concerned, it deals with recovery of debts owing to such banks and financial institutions and certain measures which can be taken outside of the court process to enforce such recovery. Under Section 13(4) of SARFAESI, apart from recourse to taking possession of secured assets of the borrower and assigning or selling them in order to realise their debts, the banks can also take over the management of the business of the borrower, and/or appoint any person as manager to manage secured assets, the possession of which has been taken over by the secured creditor. Banks as secured creditors may also require at any time by notice in writing, any person who has acquired any of the secured assets from the borrower and from whom money is due or payable to the borrower, to pay the secured creditor so much of the money as is sufficient to pay the secured debt. It is thus clear that the transfer of property, by way of sale or assignment, is only one of several measures of recovery of a secured debt owing to a bank and this being the case, it is clear that SARFAESI, as a whole, cannot possibly be said to be in pith and substance, an Act relatable to the subject matter \"transfer of property\".

However, the respondent authority should have given details about the alleged bail order in similar cases, which has not been done in the present case. A mere ipse dixit statement in the grounds of detention cannot sustain the detention order and has to be ignored. Thus, the detention order in question only contains ipse dixit regarding the alleged imminent possibility of the accused coming out on bail and there was no reliable material to this effect.

The High Court found that since two of the authorities had received representation it must be presumed that the DGP would have received the representation in the usual course. A presumption was drawn that DGP had been served the representation and accordingly it was held that the DGP must have received the representation and since that was not taken note of, there was violation of Art.22(5) of the Constitution. Accordingly, order of detention was quashed. Further appeal, held the question of making a representation to the Advisory Board arises only after the order of detention had been passed and served on the detenu.

The views of the next of kin are entitled to deference but this is not to suggest that the Authorization Committee, once a disagreement is expressed, would have no power to take an independent decision based on the best interest of the donor and the donee. Ultimately, the Authorization Committee has to take a judicious decision after considering all the facts and circumstances.\n\nIn the present case, the admitted position is that the donor and the donee are not 'near relatives' as defined in Section 2(i) of the Act. The Authorization Committee took note of the fact that the donor and the donee are cousins. The fact that other relatives of the donor including his brother and his two minor children who have objected to the proposed transplant have not disputed the relationship between the donor and the donee, is a matter of some significance. The Authorization Committee has erred in coming to the conclusion that a bond of love and affection could not be established. The Authorization Committee seems to have formed that view on the basis that : (i) the elder brother and the minor daughters of the donor had opposed the donation of a kidney by the donor to the donee; and (ii) the donee has his own relatives who have not come forward to donate a kidney. The existence of the objections of the relatives of the donor and the fact that other relatives of the donee have not come forward with a proposal for transplantation, would not, displace a case of affection and attachment between the donor and the donee. These circumstances which were borne in mind by the Authorization Committee are relevant to the ultimate decision which the Authorization Committee has to take on whether to grant its approval. The Authorization Committee however, erred in holding that the circumstances on which it relied upon did not establish a bond of love and affection between the donor and the donee. In the circumstances, that it would be necessary for the Authorization Committee to have a fresh look at the entirety of the proposal having regard to the provisions of the Act and the Rules. \t\t\t \t  [Para 11,13,15]"

An elaborate procedure is prescribed for registration of a hospital. Unless such registration for a hospital is secured a surgical operation of transplantation of human organs there is not permissible. The Act and the Rules however do not provide individual surgeons who would undertake the surgical operations, are required to be specifically authorized by the appropriate authority. The Rules of (1995) do not prohibit an expert who is member of a team of experts of a registered hospital, from performing transplantation operation in any other registered hospital. At the same time in view of the rules referred to above an expert who is not member of a team of any registered hospital, no matter, how much experience he has in this field, is not permitted to perform transplantation operation in any registered hospital.  [Para 7,10,11]\n\nThe position that emerges is that if an expert in this field as defined under rule 9-C is recognized as member of team of experts in a registered hospital, he would be able to perform surgical operations involving transplantation of kidney in any other registered hospital. The registered hospital has to ascertain as to whether such expert is a member of a team of experts in any other registered hospital. On ascertainment of this information, a registered hospital is able to permit such expert who is not member of their own team to perform transplantation operations in their hospital. The appropriate authority can not raise any objection to this practice.  [Para 11]"

The Authorisation Committee is, therefore, required to satisfy that the real purpose of the donor authorizing removal of the organ is by reason of affection or attachment towards the recipient or for any other special reason. Such special reasons can by no stretch of imagination encompass commercial elements. Above being the intent, the inevitable conclusion is that the Authorisation Committees of the State to which the donor and the donee belong have to take the exercise to find out whether approval is to be accorded. Such Committee shall be in a better position to ascertain the true intent and the purpose for the authorisation to remove the organ and whether any commercial element is involved or not. They would be in a better position to lift the veil of projected affection or attachment and the so-called special reasons and focus on the true intent. The burden is on the applicants to establish the real intent by placing relevant materials for consideration of the Authorisation Committee. Whether there exists any affection or attachment or special reason is within the special knowledge of the applicants, and a heavy burden lies on them to establish it. Several relevant factors like relationship if any (need not be near relationship for which different considerations have been provided for), period of acquaintance, degree of association, reciprocity of feelings, gratitude and similar human factors and bounds can throw light on the issue. It is always open to the Authorisation Committee considering the application to seek information/materials from Authorisation Committees of other States/State Governments, as the case may be, for effective decision in the matter. In case any State is not covered by the operation of the Act or the Rules, the operative executive instructions/Government orders will hold the field. As the object is to find out the true intent behind the donor's willingness to donate the organ, it would not be in line with the legislative intent to require the Authorisation Committee of the State where the recipient is undergoing medical treatment to decide the issue whether approval is to be accorded. \t [Para 12]"

The winding up/liquidation of the company shall be the last resort and only on an eventuality when the corporate insolvency resolution process fails. The primary focus of the legislation while enacting the IBC is to ensure revival and continuation of the corporate debtor by protecting the corporate debtor from its own management and from a corporate debt by liquidation and such corporate insolvency resolution process is to be completed in a time-bound manner. Therefore, the entire \"corporate insolvency resolution process\" as such cannot be equated with \"winding up proceedings\".

                "description": "Expression \"unauthorised occupation\" under S.2(g) - It connotes occupation by any person of the \"Public Premises\" defined under S.2(e) of the Act without authority for such occupation - Government Company or Corporation must not act as a private landlord and their act while determining authority to occupy public premises and seeking eviction of the occupant therefrom must be informed by reason and guided by the public interest.\n\nThe expression \"unauthorised occupation\" under section 2(g) connotes occupation by any person of the \"public premises\" defined under section 2(e) of the Act without authority for such occupation.  It implies occupation by a person who has entered into occupation of any public premises without lawful authority as well as occupation which is permissive at the inception but has ceased to be so.  It also covers any person, whose legal authority to remain in the public premises has been determined by the landlord for committing breach of the terms and conditions of the contract or tenancy as case may be.  In other words, an \"unauthorised occupant\" is one whose tenancy has come to an end by efflux of time or has been terminated by giving notice as provided in law.  Such occupant would have no further statutory protection from being evicted under the Rent Act or where tenancy has been determined on the ground of creating unlawful sub-tenancy by giving notice under section 106 and which is not protected under section 108 of the T.P. Act.  The requirement in law for eviction under the provisions contained in the Act is that the occupation of public premises should be unauthorised within the meaning of section 2(g).  It is also necessary that the Government company or the corporation must not act as a private landlord and their act while determining authority to occupy public premises and seeking eviction of the occupant therefrom must be informed by reasons and guided by the public interest.\n\nInsofar as present case is concerned, the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the parties were centered around the provisions contained in Sections 106 and 108 of the T.P. Act.  It was submitted that the notice issued under section 106 of the T.P. Act, in the present case, cannot be sustained since the sub-tenancy of respondent no.2 in the premises was perfectly legal and was protected under section 108 of the said Act.  Section 108 of the T.P. Act provides for rights and liabilities of the lessor and the lessee and clause (j) thereof provides for the lessee to transfer absolutely or by way of mortgage or sub-lease the whole or any part of his interest in the property, and any transferee of such interest or part may again transfer it subject to a contract, if any, to the contrary.  The lessee does not, by reason only of such transfer, cease to be subject to any of the liabilities attaching to the lease.  It further provides that nothing in this clause shall be deemed to authorise a tenant having an untransferable right of occupant to assign his interest as tenant or lessee.  In short, in the absence of a contract to the contrary the lessee has a right to transfer absolutely or sub-lease the whole or part of his interest in the property.  AIR 1981 SC 670 - Referred to.

Section 19 of the Specific Relief Act clearly says subsequent sale can be enforced for good and sufficient reason but in the present case, there is no difficulty because the suit was filed on 3.5.1975 for specific performance of the agreement  and the second sale took place on 5.5.1975. Therefore, it is the admitted position that the second sale was definitely after the filing of the suit in question. Had that not been the position then we would have evaluated the effect of Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act. But in the present case it is more than apparent that the suit was filed before the second sale of the property. Therefore, the principle of lis pendens will govern the present case and the second sale cannot have the overriding effect on the first sale.  Normally, as a public policy once a suit has been filed pertaining to any subject matter of the property, in order to put an end to such kind of litigation, the principle of lis pendens has been evolved so that the litigation may finally terminate without intervention of a third party. This is because of public policy otherwise no litigation will come to an end. Therefore, in order to discourage that same subject matter of property being subjected to subsequent sale to a third person, this kind of transaction is to be checked. Otherwise, litigation will never come to an end.  [Para 3]"

A contract for specific performance may be enforced against the parties to the contract and the persons mentioned in section 19. Clause (b) of Section 19 makes it very clear that a suit for specific performance cannot be enforced against a person who is a transferee from the vendor for valuable consideration and without notice of the original contract which is sought to be enforced in the suit.

Act and Rent Act - Reconciliation of.\n\n\tThe objective of SARFAESI Act, coupled with the T.P. Act and the Rent Act are required to be reconciled herein in the following manner:\n\na) \tIf a valid tenancy under law is in existence even prior to the creation of the mortgage, the tenant's possession cannot be disturbed by the secured creditor by taking possession of the property. The lease has to be determined in accordance with Section 111 of the TP Act for determination of leases. As the existence of a prior existing lease inevitably affects the risk undertaken by the bank while providing the loan, it is expected of Banks/Creditors to have conducted a standard due diligence in this regard. Where the bank has proceeded to accept such a property as mortgage, it will be presumed that it has consented to the risk that comes as a consequence of the existing tenancy. In such a situation, the rights of a rightful tenant cannot be compromised under the SARFAESI Act proceedings.\n\nb) \tIf a tenancy under law comes into existence after the creation of a mortgage, but prior to the issuance of notice under Section 13(2) of the SARFAESI Act, it has to satisfy the conditions of Section 65A of the T.P. Act.\n\nc) \tIn any case, if any of the tenants claim that he is entitled to possession of a secured asset for a term of more than a year, it has to be supported by the execution of a registered instrument. In the absence of a registered instrument, if the tenant relies on an unregistered instrument or an oral agreement accompanied by delivery of possession, the tenant is not entitled to possession of the secured asset for more than the period prescribed under Section 107 of the T.P. Act. \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 25]"

                "description": "Maharashtra Rent Control Act (1999), S.1 - Recovery proceedings - Stay application by tenant of secured asset i.e. flat - Tenability - Bank sought physical possession of secured asset i.e. flat of borrower-landlord - Tenant claimed to have entered into oral agreement of tenancy before mortgage deed in respect of suit flat was entered into between bank and borrower - However, no evidence produced by tenant to establish tenancy, except xerox rent receipts - Claim about bona fide tenancy, not tenable - S.13(13) bars entering into such tenancy beyond 2012 - Since notice u/S.13(2) was issued on 30-4-2011, subsequent reckoning of tenancy, is barred - Person occupying premises, when tenancy has been determined, can only be treated as \"tenant in sufferance\" - Such tenants are akin to trespassers - Operation of Rent Act cannot be extended to them.\n\n\tIn the instant case, at the time when the SARFAESI Act proceedings were pending, the factum of tenancy was never revealed by the parties. The earlier order dated 09.03.2012, passed by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, directing the Assistant Registrar to take over the possession of the secured asset, is silent about any existing encumbrance over the secured asset. It was only after passing of the aforesaid order of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, that the appellant-tenant started agitating his rights before the Small Causes Court based on a completely different fact scenario, without a whisper of the alleged tenancy under the concluded Section 14, SARFAESI Act proceedings. The borrower/landlord did not even respond to the claims of the appellant-tenant. The bank has produced multiple records to substantiate their claim that the tenant was nowhere to be seen earlier and that this tenancy was created just to defeat the proceedings initiated under the SARFAESI Act. On the contrary, the appellant-tenant has failed to produce any evidence to substantiate his claim over the secured asset. In such a situation, the appellant-tenant cannot claim protection under the garb of the interim protection granted to him, ex parte, by solely relying upon the xerox of the rent receipts.\n\n\tThe stay application of the appellant-tenant seems to be an afterthought. It is clear that the respondent no. 2-borrower/landlord never intimated the respondent no. 1-bank about the alleged tenancy. In light of the above, the claim of bona fide tenancy of the appellant-tenant, cannot be accepted.\n\n\tIn any case, considering the counterfactual pleaded by the appellant-tenant himself, that he was a tenant who had entered into an oral agreement, such tenancy impliedly does not carry any covenant for renewal, as provided under Section 65A of T.P. Act. Therefore, in any case, Section 13(13) SARFAESI Act bars entering into such tenancy beyond January, 2012. As the notice under Section 13 (2) SARFAESI Act was issued on 30.04.2011, subsequent reckoning of the tenancy is barred. Such person occupying the premises, when the tenancy has been determined, can only be treated as a 'tenant in sufferance'. Such tenants do not have any legal rights and are akin to trespassers.\n\n\tThe operation of the Rent Act cannot be extended to a 'tenant-in-sufferance' visavis the SARFAESI Act, due to the operation of Section 13(2) read with Section 13(13) of the SARFAESI Act. A contrary interpretation would violate the intention of the legislature to provide for Section 13(13), which has a valuable role in making the SARFAESI Act a self-executory instrument for debt recovery. Moreover, such an interpretation would also violate the mandate of Section 35, SARFAESI Act which is couched in broad terms.\n\n1995 ALLMR ONLINE 1321 (S.C.), 1981 ALLMR ONLINE 22 (S.C.), AIR 1997 SC 2690 Ref. to.\t [Para 31,32,33,36]"

It is a \"chose in action\", providing not a right to ownership of corporeal property, but it is the beneficial interest to obtain right to ownership of incorporeal property. It creates beneficial interest in the movable property which can be enforced by action of law. A claimant is entitled to knock the door of the Court and the Court would recognize the claim for granting relief. It is heritable and assignable by executing a deed of conveyance. It is not a right to sue but something more than that and something less than the right of ownership of immovable property. It does not require any consideration, which is apparent from the provisions of Section 130 of the Transfer of Property Act itself. The assignment is to be effected by executing an instrument in writing signed by the transferee or his authorized agent and it is complete and effectual upon the execution of such an instrument. Thus, a deed of assignment of a decree for specific performance of contract, merely gives a cause of action to a claim for specific performance of contract of assignment and nothing more. The Deed at Exhibit 178 conforms to all such requirements and hence it can be characterised as the transfer of an actionable claim and the absence of evidence regarding consideration cannot be a ground to hold that the deed of conveyance is not enforceable. Hence, no consideration is required to be shown to transfer/assignment of a decree for specific performance of contract, which is an actionable claim.  [Para 37,38]"

Thus what has been provided for under sub-section (8) of Section 13 of the Act is the well established principle that a mortgage once created, the right to redeem the same at any time before its title is transferred in accordance with law, subsists. Therefore, Section 13 of the Act has provided for a great balancing act between the interests of the secured creditors as well as the borrowers. \t [Para 13,23,24]\n\nA mortgage is a security given by a person for ensuring or facilitating the fulfilment of some obligation undertaken by him. Usually the obligation for which security is offered relates to repayment of a debt. While a simple debt of money confers on the creditor a jus in personam, a right which is enforceable against a determinate individual debtor. Such a simple debt of money is realizable by obtaining a money decree and then brining the property of the debtor to sale in execution of such a decree. If, in the meantime, the debtor alienates his property, the creditor cannot ordinarily follow such a property as the alienee in the meantime acquires certain other rights in the same property, in which case a creditor can only proceed against the individual debtor and his interests can sometimes be jeopardized inasmuch as, the remaining assets of the debtor could be insufficient to discharge the debt in full. For this reason, creditors require security to be furnished in the shape of a real property, the value of which the creditor can safely rely and in case of necessity, turn the same into money. Most importantly the creditor can follow the property even when it was lying in the hands of some other third parties pursuant to it's alienation by the debtor. A mortgage is, thus a security which confers upon the creditor some right in rem. It is a right in re aliena for it exists in regard to property of which the ownership is in another person. The very definition of a mortgage, as per Section 58 of Transfer of Property Act, shows that it is nothing more than a transfer of an interest in a specified immovable property and all that the mortgagee gets is not the legal ownership of the property but merely an interest in immovable property. While a relationship of a debtor and a creditor subsists in case of mortages, but most importantly, the right to redeem remains with the debtor. The equity of redemption is singularly significant in that a mortgage shall always be redeemable and a mortgagor's right to redeem shall neither be taken away nor can be limited by any contract between the parties. \t\t [Para 15,19]\n\nThus, the mortgagor's right to redeem the mortgage even after the specified time lapsed subsists and still the mortgagor can claim to redeem the property. Hence, this right of the mortgagor has come to be known as \"Equity of Redemption\". The rule against clogs on the equity of redemption is that, a mortgage shall always be redeemable and a mortgagor's right to redeem shall neither be taken away nor be limited by any contract between the parties. The doctrine of equity of redemption came to be expressed in the maxim 'Once a mortgage, always a mortgage'. And this principle has taken now a firm footing in the form of Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act. So long as the mortgagor had a right to redeem the mortgage, he can always pay off the debt together with interest to the mortgagee and get back possession of the mortgaged property. This position would continue so long as the property is not sold under a final decree of sale brought about in accordance with the provisions of Order XXXIV C.P.C or any other law providing therefore. \t\t\t\t [Para 19,21]"

In case of an immovable property, a security interest is created in a secured asset by way of a mortgage in favour of the secured creditor. There may be cases where before the mortgage is created in respect of an immovable property, the borrower had already leased out the immovable property in favour of a lessee either as the owner or as a person competent or authorised to transfer the immovable property in accordance with Section 7 of the Transfer of Property Act. If such a lease is made, by virtue of Section 8 of the Transfer of Property Act, the lessee will have the right to enjoy the leased property in accordance with the terms and condition of the lease irrespective of whether a subsequent mortgagee of the immovable property has knowledge of such a lease or not.      [Para 11]\n\nOne of the measures mentioned in clause (a) in sub-section (4) of Section 13 of the SARFAESI Act is to take possession of the secured assets of the borrower including the right to transfer by way of lease. Where, however, the lawful possession of the secured asset is not with the borrower, but with the lessee under a valid lease, the secured creditor cannot take over possession of the secured asset until the lawful possession of the lessee gets determined. There is, however, no mention in sub-section (4) of Section 13 of the SARFAESI Act that a lease made by the borrower in favour of a lessee will stand determined on the secured creditor deciding to take any of the measures mentioned in Section 13 of the said Act.

By reason of sub-rule (1) of Rule 8 of Order XXXIV, a mortgagor is entitled to make an application for final decree at any time before a final decree debarring the plaintiff from all rights to redeem the mortgaged property has been passed or before the confirmation of a sale held in pursuance of a final decree passed under sub-rule (3) of this rule. No such application is again contemplated at the instance of the usufructuary mortgagee. By reason of sub-rule (1) of Rule 8 of Order XXXIV, a right of redemption is conferred upon the mortgagor of a usufructuary mortgage. Such a provision has been made evidently having regard to the right of redemption of a mortgagor in terms of Section 60 of the Transfer of Property Act and further having regard to the fact that a usufructuary mortgagee would be entitled to possess the property in question till a final decree of redemption is passed.  [Para 21]\n\nThe right of redemption of mortgagor being a statutory right, the same can be taken away only in terms of the proviso appended to Section 60 of the Act which is extinguished either by a decree or by act of parties. Admittedly, in the instant case, no decree has been passed extinguishing the right of the mortgagor nor such right has come to an end by act of the parties.\t [Para 22]\n\nSub-rule (1) of Rule 8 shows that only a mortgagor can apply to the Court to pass a final decree on payment of the amount found or declared due under the preliminary decree on making this deposit and upon filing the application as provided for in sub-rule (1) of Rule 8 the mortgagor can request the Court to order the mortgagee to put him in possession of the properties which were the subject-matter of the mortgage. The amount determined by the Court which the mortgagor is liable to pay to the mortgagee can be deposited before the right to redeem is lost. It may be noticed that even sub-rule (2) of Rule 7 of Order XXXIV does not apply to the usufructuary mortgage. It may be noticed that by reason of the amendment introduced in 1929 the right conferred earlier on a usufructuary mortgagee to bring the property to sale in case of the mortgagor not making the payment within the time fixed in the decree was taken away. As sub-rule (2) of Rule 7 is applicable only in a case of mortgages other than the usufructuary mortgages, a usufructuary mortgagor is not entitled to seek extension of time and in that view of the matter the fact that such an application made by the first respondent herein was rejected becomes irrelevant.\t [Para 25]"

Composite decrees were passed in both under O.34, Rr.4, 5 together.  Those were the provisions in regard to enforcement of mortgages, and whatever may be the wording of the decree, they shall be deemed to be passed under O.34, R.5 as it stood at the time of the passing of the decree.  It is not necessary that all the clauses mentioned in the provisions under which the decree is passed should be incorporated in the decree.  While interpreting such a decree, it must be read as if all the provisions threin are incorporated in the decree.  The Court may not at the time of passing of the decree, be aware as to which contingency will happen in future.  Each of the decrees was under O.34, R.5 of the Code as it stood before 20-11-1990.  The effect of S.97(1) of the Amendment Act is that all the local amendments made to any of the provisions of the Code which were inconsistent with the Code as amended by the Amendment Act stood repealed irrespective of fact whether the corresponding provision of the Code had been amended or modified by the Amendment Act and that was subject only to what was found in sub-s.(2) of S.97.  That being so, the Kerala amendment was not effective from 1-2-1977 till 20-11-1990.  Right of redemption of a mortgage is a substantive right of mortgagor which was accrued to him to be exercised under O.34, R.5, C.P.C. when the decree was passed which cannot be taken away by the amendment of O.34 of the Code which was made only after the decree in this case.  The right of the mortgagor to redeem the property is available to him till the confirmation of the sale in pursucance to the decree.  Application under O.34, R5 is maintainable until final determination of proceedings to set aside the sale under O.34 either by way of appeal or revision.\t\t [Para 11,16,17]"

Section 146 of the Code of Civil Procedure shows that if the rights are purchased by third party after passing the decree, they have right to file execution application for the fruits of the said decree but same depends upon which type of decree was passed by the court. If the decree is in the nature of personal right then that cannot be executable. But if it is in respect of immovable property, that can. Not only that even bare reading of Order XXI Rule 16 of the Code of Civil Procedure shows that subsequent purchaser / owner can execute the decree in respect of immovable property. The reading of Explanation to said Rule 16 also shows that it is not necessary that the decree holder should assign the decree in favour of subsequent purchaser. The subsequent purchaser who purchases the said property in respect of which decree has been passed, acquired the right to execute the decree.\n\nIn the present proceeding, the respondents purchased the suit property on 14.7.1985 and they stepped into the shoes of the decree holder. That decree is passed on the ground of arrears of rent. The respondent gets right to recover the possession in view of subsequent development and section 146 of the Code of Civil Procedure. The objection raised by the petitioner that in view of section 109 of the Transfer of Property Act, respondents could not get right to execute decree is not sustainable in law. Section 109 of Transfer of Property Act is very clear that subject to the terms and condition of instrument/sale deed/conveyance, the transferee gets right to recover the rent. In the present proceeding in hand, it is crystal clear from Execution Application filed by respondent that, they asked the assistance of the Court for executing the decree for possession and not for recovery of arrears of rent or any other relief.\n\nAIR 1969 PATNA 13, 1993 (3) BCR 305 Disting.

                "description": "Suit for eviction or recovery of arrears of rent as well as for future mesne profit - Suit between lessor and lessee - Interim relief in nature of deposit of rent or compensation by the lessee - Provisions of law which are attracted in the matter is Order 15-A and not Order 39, R.10 of C.P.C. - Order passed under order 15-A, not appellable.\n\nIn a suit for recovery of money or anything which is capable of being delivered and further when the opposite party admits that the money or such things is held by the said opposite party as trustee or that it belongs to or is due to another party, the Court is empowered to issue direction to deposit money or such thing or to deliver such thing to the party on whose behalf such money or thing is held as trustee or to whom admittedly such money or thing belong to.  For due performance of such order, the Court can also issue further directions as may warrant in a given case including the direction for furnishing security whenever occasion arises for such direction.  Being so, in case of a suit for the claim of damages, if an application for interim relief is filed, the Court would not be debarred from exercising the power under the provisions of law contained in Order 39 rule 10 of CPC.  However, to ascertain whether such an exercise in the case in hand was permissible and/or warranted, it is not sufficient merely to refer to Order 39 rule 10 of CPC and it would also be necessary to take into consideration Provisions of Order XV-A of the C.P.C.  [Para 7]\n\nBare reading of the provisions of order XV-A of C.P.C., would disclose that in a suit filed by the lessor or licensor against the lessee or licensee either for the eviction or for the recovery of arrears of rent as well as for future mesne profit, the Court can direct the defendant in the suit to deposit such amount as Court may direct on account of arrears of rent as well as may direct to continue to deposit further rent or license fees during the pendency of the suit and in case of failure to comply with such order, the Court may after hearing the parties, if dis-satisfied with the explanation given for non compliance thereof, may order striking off the defence.  Being so, it is aparent that in the suits between the lessor and lessee or licensor and licensee specific provision is made under order XV-A to ensure the recovery of the amount of arrears as well as amount arising during the pendency of the suit for the possession of the premises by way of eviction of the licensee or the lessee therefrom.  It is well settled law that when specific provisions are made for specific purposes in the CPC, the Courts are expected to take resort of those provisions of law and not to exercise their jurisdiction under some other provision of law.  Undoubtedly, Order 39 rule 10 empowers the Court to direct delivery of the money or the property or thing held by the defendant as trustee for the plaintiff or admitted to be belonging to the plaintiff or due to the plaintiff and pass an appropriate order in that regard in a suit where the subject matter is either the money or relating to thing capable of delivery; at the same time in relation to the suits between the lessor and lessee or licensor and licensee specific provisions are made under order XV-A to deal with the matters pertaining to the payment or deposit of the amount accruing during the pendency of the suit either as rent or as license fees or even as mesne profit and therefore,it is difficult to agree with the respondent's contention that in the present case wherein the suit was undoubtedly for eviction of the firm who was inducted as the lessee and from whom possession was sought for and similarly claim for compensation/damages is made on account of continuation of occupation of the leased premises by the petitioners after the expiry or the alleged termination of lease by the respondents, the trial court could have granted the interim relief for payment of monthly amount or arrears in exercise of powers vide Order 39 Rule 10, when specific provisions of law for grant of such interim relief are available under Order XV-A of C.P.C. Undoubetedly, such a relief can be availed under order XV-A and therefore, it was not permissible to the Court to take resort to the other provisions in such cases and therefore, the contention sought to be raised on behalf of the petitioners is well founded that the interim application which was filed by the respondents was in terms of order XV-A of CPC and not in terms of order 39 rule 10 of CPC.  [Para 9]\n\nConsidering the fact that order dated 28.2.2002 was passed by the trial court in exercise of powers under order 15A and the provisions relating to appeal against the orders passed by the Courts in terms of the provisions of CPC, it is aparent that the orders passed under 15A are not appelable.  Being so, the petitioners are justified in contending that the appellate bench of the Small Causes Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the Appeal against the order dated 28.2.2002.  On that count itself, the petition is bound to succeed and the impugned order is liable to be set aside. AIR 1985 Bom 4(DB) and 1983 MLJ 88 (DB) - Referred to.  [Para 13]"

                "description": "Doctrine of lis pendens - Scope and applicability of - Doctrine of lis pendens would not apply to sales after a suit is dismissed and before it is restored. (Per S. J. Vazifdar, J.).\n\nFirstly, it is necessary to distinguish between a dismissal of a suit on merits and the filing of an appeal therefrom, from a dismissal of a suit for default and the restoration thereof pursuant to an application for the same after the period prescribed for such an application. An appeal is a continuation of the suit. The Appellant has a statutory right of appeal if it is filed within the prescribed period. Once an application for restoration is made, different considerations would apply. But, between the period of the dismissal of a suit and an application for restoration, the provisions of section 52 and principles analogous thereto cannot apply. During this period, there is no suit at all. There is no proceeding in existence. The language of section 52 indicates that it must be during the pendency of the proceedings. That a suit is deemed to have been pending throughout upon its being restored on an application is irrelevant. That is to avoid consequences such as of limitation and court fees. This view would affect the rights of third parties for no fault of theirs. Indeed, such a view would leave a clog on the title of the suit property permanently, forever. It is possible for a plaintiff to apply for restoration even after years. Indeed, our records are full of such cases where courts have, albeit for good reason, restored cases after many years. When then does the clog on title disappear ? Theoretically, never. This is irrespective of the merits of the suit or proceeding for once it is filed and dismissed, the title to the subject matter of the suit can never be clear, it is always under a cloud for an application for restoration can be made at any time. To expect innocent third parties to then adopt proceedings challenging orders of restoration is only to invite a multiplicity of proceedings. Such a view would keep the doors to fraud open permanently by the simple expedient of a person filing a suit in respect of the Defendant's property, having the same dismissed for default and then sitting back doing nothing till the plaintiff chooses to make an application for restoration. For if it is restored even after many years, all transactions between the date of its dismissal and the date even of an application for restoration, would be affected by the doctrine of lis pendens.

(Per U. D. Salvi, J.).\n\nThe Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, has provided corrective mechanism under Order 9, Rule 4 for restoration of the suit dismissed for default and for that purpose has envisaged full-fledged judicial enquiry to understand the circumstances in which the suit was dismissed for default and then to come to a conclusion regarding the material question as to whether such circumstances warranted the dismissal of the suit or not. In short, the judicial enquiry envisaged under the said provision is for examination of the legitimacy of the dismissal of the suit for the alleged default. Once the court comes to a conclusion either way the question of legitimacy of 'dismissal of the suit for default' is clearly answered. If it is found that the circumstances did not warrant the dismissal of the suit for default, such dismissal is no longer legitimate and has no existence in law. It is only in such circumstances, the suit stands restored. Restoration of the suit, therefore, brings about restoration of status-quo ante which existed on the date of the dismissal of the suit for default. In my considered opinion, the 'lis' therefore, continues between the period of dismissal of a suit and its restoration upon an application made under Order 9, Rule 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.

All that Section 52 provides is that in any suit or proceeding (which is not collusive) and in which any right to immovable property is directly and specifically in question, the property cannot be transferred or otherwise dealt with by any party to the suit or proceeding \u201cso as to affect the rights of any other party thereto\u201d, under any decree or order which may be made therein, except under the authority of the Court and on such terms as it may impose. It can thus be seen that the transfer pendente lite governed by Section 52 of the TP Act is subject to the decree or order passed in the suit or proceeding and such transfer cannot affect the rights of any other party to the suit. There is a clear distinction between a transfer pendente lite governed by Section 52 of the TP Act and a transfer which is in breach of any prohibitory order passed by the Court. These two transfers clearly differ in so far as their effect is concerned. In the prior case, governed by Section 52, the transfer is only subject to the outcome or the order or the decree passed in the suit or proceeding as the case may be.\t(Para 39)"

                "description": "Validity of transfer of property by gift to a minor - Presumption as to its acceptance - Revocability of gift deed - Gift made by mother to her minor son - It was revoked by donor after lapse of 25 years - Mean while minor who had attained majority had not repudiated the gift - Held revocation is not valid.\n\nUnder the Transfer of Property Act read with the Indian Contract Act the acquisition of property being generally beneficial, a child can take property in any manner whatsoever either under intestacy or by Will or by purchase or gift or other assurance inter vivos, except where it is clearly to his prejudice to do so. A gift inter-vivos to a child cannot be revoked. There is a presumption in favour of the validity of a gift of a parent or a grandparent to a child, if it is complete. When a gift is made to a child, generally there is a presumption of its acceptance because express acceptance in his case is not possible and only an implied  acceptance can be expected.   [Para 21]\n\nWhere a gift is made in favour of a child of the donor, who is the guardian of the child, the acceptance of a gift can be  presumed to have been made by him or on his behalf without any overt act signifying acceptance by the minor. In the instant case, mother who is the natural guardian gifted the property to her minor son in the  year 1945. The donee was an educated lad of 16 years of age, capable of understanding and living jointly with the donor. Knowledge of the execution of the gift would have  been derived in normal circumstances, by the minor, being beneficiary, sooner or later after its execution. Knowledge of gift deed to both the parents as natural guardians  and the donee is sufficient to indicate acceptance of gift by the minor himself or on his behalf by the parents. The gift deed was revoked by the mother much after its  execution as late as in the year 1970. By that time, the donee had become major and he never repudiated the gift. Non-  delivery of possession of the gifted property, non-exercise of any rights of ownership over it, and failure by the donee, on attaining majority, in getting his name mutated in  official records are not circumstances negativing the presumption of acceptance by the minor during his minority or on his  attaining majority. The donor had reserved to herself, under the terms of gift deed, the right to manage, possess and enjoy the  property during her lifetime. Since the possession and enjoyment of the property including management of the school were  retained by the donor during her life time, the acceptance of the ownership of the  property gifted could be by silent acceptance. Such acceptance is confirmed by its non- repudiation by his parents and by him on attaining majority.\t\t\t\t\t\t      [Para 25]\n\nIn the case of a minor donee receiving a gift from her parents, no express acceptance can be expected  and is possible, and acceptance can be implied even by mere silence or such conduct of the minor donee and his other natural guardian as not to indicate any disapproval or repudiation of it.   [Para 30]\n\nTherefore, the Trial Court and the High Court were wrong in coming to the conclusion that there was no valid acceptance of the gift by the minor donee. Consequently, conclusion has to follow that the gift having been duly accepted in law and thus being complete, it  was irrevocable under Section 126 of the Transfer of Property Act. Section 126 prohibits revocation of a validly executed  gift except in circumstances mentioned therein. The gift was executed in 1945. It remained in force for about 25 years during which time the donee had attained majority and had not repudiated the same. It was therefore, not competent for the donor to  have cancelled the gift and executed a Will in relation to the property.   [Para 31]"

Thus, a Mohammedan may also make a disposition of his entire property if all the heirs signified their consent to the same. In other words, the general principle that a Mohammedan cannot by Will dispose of more than a third of his estate after payment of funeral expenses and debts is capable of being avoided by the consent of all the heirs. In effect, the same also amounts to a right of relinquishment of future inheritance which is on the one hand forbidden and on the other accepted in the case of testamentary disposition.

Determination of lease in accordance with the Transfer of Property Act is unnecessary and a mere surplusage because the landlord cannot get eviction of the tenant even after such determination.  The tenant continues to be so even thereafter.  Making out a case under the Rent act for eviction of the tenant by itself is sufficient and it is not obligatory to found the proceedings on the basis of the determination of the lease by issue of notice in accordance with Section 106 Transfer of Property Act.\t [Para 5]\n\nEven if the category of tenant which is stated in Section 5(11)(b) of Bombay Rent Act which says that even after the termination of tenancy the person continues to be a tenant, is not included in the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, when the tenant cannot be evicted unless the grounds are made out and the conditions laid down under Section 16 of the Maharashtra Rent Control Act are fulfilled, there would be no dual requirement one of the issuance of notice under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act and then making out a ground under that section for eviction.  Of course, a special provision can be made in a Rent Act requiring the issuance of a notice under Sec.106 Transfer of Property Act, as it was there in C.P. & Berar Letting of Premises and Rent Control Order 1949.

The counsel for defendant/revision petitioner vehemently argued that the notice under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act was actually issued by the plaintiff/respondent and thereafter the rent was accepted which amounts to waiver.

It prima facie appears to be a gift under Mohammaden Law.

It is stated in S.150 that if these conditions are complied with, the gift is complete.  In fact sub-sec.

(1908), S.9 - Suit for recovery of \"open plot\" - Jurisdiction of Civil Court - Landlord can (after 31-3-2000) recover possession of \"open plot\" by a suit in accordance with general law - Held, permission under Rent Control Order was not necessary prior to the date of institution of suit.\n\nEarlier the landlord of \"open plot\" was required to approach the Rent Controller for permission to initiate recovery suit as the word \"House\" was replaced by the word \"premises\" with effect from 21.7.1989 and clause 13-A was added to the Rent Control Order on 26.10.1989. It was statutory disability of the Landlord of \"open plot\" included in definition of 'premises' due to restriction introduced as above in the Rent Control Orders which was removed by the Maharashtra Rent Act, 1999 with effect from 31.3.2000. Thus, landlord became free to enforce his right under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 and to terminate tenancy. Jurisdiction of the Civil Court to pass decree of eviction and execute it, is restored and hence, landlord can (after 31.3.2000) recover possession of 'open plot' by a suit in accordance with general law.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 16]\n\nWhen the legislature brought into force the Maharashtra Rent Control Act, 1999, provisions of new Rent Act gave option for the Landlord to continue with the proceedings before the Rent Controller under the old Repealed Rent Control Order if he so desires or to institute a fresh proceeding under the new Act or to recover \"open plot\" of land not included in the definition of \"premises\" under the new Maharashtra Rent Act, the landlord has remedy w.e.f. 31.3.2000 under the General Law i.e. Transfer of Property Act, 1882 to recover possession of open plot by approaching the competent Civil Court. Under this changed legal scenario, landlord of the \"open plot\" cannot be compelled to start a fresh proceedings before the Rent Control Authority under the repealed Act to obtain permission to initiate legal proceedings against Tenant. In the present case, learned Counsel for the Appellant (defendant-tenant) could not point out any provision to urge that the landlord was restricted by the then prevalent Rent Control Order from exercising his right under the General Law and approaching the competent Civil Court on the basis of notice to quit issued under Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1992 at the time when the suit was instituted on 3.10.1988 in the trial Court. Therefore, the conclusions by the Courts below were based upon the evidence led, the admissions given and the settled position of law as then existing and conceded to. The Courts below, therefore, were right to hold that permission under the Rent Control Order was not necessary prior to the date before institution of suit in this case.

The panch witness has stated that the notice was affixed to the outer door of the suit premises on 28th September, 1978. No explanation is offered as to why the plaintiff felt the necessity of serving the notice by pasting on 28th September, 1978 i.e. 13 days after the notice was despatched by registered post. The respondent had not even made an enquiry with the post office as to whether the notice was delivered to the addressee before resorting to service by pasting. The respondent has not stated anything as to why he felt the need of service of notice by pasting. The panch witness who was examined to prove the pasting of notice has stated in the examination-in-chief that he knew both the plaintiff and the defendant.  He has further stated that at the time of pasting he himself, the plaintiff and the defendant and one witness were present. If the petitioner-defendant was personally present, when the notice was pasted to the outer door as alleged, the notice could very well have been tendered and personally delivered to the addressee (the petitioner) which is one of the modes of service prescribed under section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882.  Nobody has stated that the notice was tendered to the petitioner and was not accepted by him and therefore it was pasted. Therefore, case of the respondent that the notice was pasted to the outer door in presence of the petitioner-defendant is totally unbelievable. Even the appellate Court has not held that service of notice by pasting was proved. Thus, the respondent has not proved the service of notice either by pasting or by registered post A.D. Section 12 of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates (Control) Act, 1947 requires a notice of demand to be issued before filing of the suit for possession on the ground of non payment of rent. A suit can be filed only after the expiry of 30 days of the notice of demand in writing. In the present case, the service of notice of demand is not proved. Therefore, the respondent was not entitled to file a suit for possession on the ground of default and no decree for possession could be passed on that ground.   [Para 7,8]"

Where a Rent Act giving protection to a tenant is not applicable, the rights of the parties are governed by the Transfer of Property Act, 1882. In a case where the rights are governed purely by the Transfer of Property Act, a co-owner can file a suit for eviction of a tenant by joining other co-owner, whether consenting or not, as party defendant to the suits. The need to file suit alone only by joining the other co-owner as party defendant to the suit may arise under various circumstances. In some cases a co-owner may not be available for signing of the plaint though he may have consented to the filing of the suit. In some cases, a co-owner may not agree to share the expenses of litigation and on that count may refuse to sign the plaint. In such cases the suit can be filed by joining the co-owner as a party defendant. In yet another case, a co-owner may collude with the tenant or for any collateral reason refuse to join the other co-owners in filing of the suit. In such a case, the other co-owners are not helpless. They can certainly file a suit against the tenant by joining the dissenting co-owner as party defendant to the suit. This is the position in law where a suit is governed by the Transfer of Property Act. \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 9]"

It is for the tenant to make necessary arrangement to receive the notice addressed to him in his absence at the suit premises and, failure on the part of tenant in that regard cannot enure to his benefit to contend that on account of his absence at the premises, the presumption of service would stand rebutted.  It is  further to be noted that postal endorsement is not of refusal to receive but to the effect that the letter was not claimed.  In other words, there was presumption not only regarding service of the notice but also regarding intimation of a letter having been received in the post office addressed to the tenant and failure to collect the same by the tenant as he was found absent in the premises at the time when postman approached the premises to deliver the same.  The presumption regarding intimation would arise under section 114 of the Evidence Act, as it is observed by the Apex Court, it is a general practice for the postman to intimate either orally or in writing about the letter having been received in the post office addressed to the tenant when the tenant is found absent in the premises at the time when the postman approaches to serve the same.  Undisputedly, there was no such effort made by the petitioner either to receive the notice at the address sent to him during his alleged absence nor any explanation forthcoming as to why arrangement was not made to collect the letter from the postal authorities on intimation thereof.  Being so, the presumption of service has not been rebutted.\n\nAs regards service of affixation on door as already observed above, the same is permissible when actual service by tendering notice to the tenant or by registered post is not practicable.  In that case, once a letter is received with postal endorsement that it was not claimed by addressee, it is obvious that though the presumption of service may arise under Section 28 of the Bombay General Clauses Act, the actual service was not practicable as far as the landlord is concerned.  The legal presumption arising from postal endorsement is different from the understanding of the factual situation to the landlord or understanding of the landlord regarding service of notice, and in that connection if the landlord makes another attempt to serve the notice by affixation of such notice to the suit premises and the same is effected in presence of any witness or factum of affixation at the door otherwise is established, the same can be considered as good service of notice in terms of Section 106 of Transfer of Property Act, and therefore service by affixation in the case in hand cannot be found fault with.

                "description": "Sale of land by tenant in contravention of S.43 - Sale is invalid - Suit for repossession from vendee - S.29 does not apply.\n\nOne Hiralal was a tenant in respect  of some land.  He entered with agreement of sale with respondent in respect of the land for a consideration.  The agreement of sale was registered and possession of land was given to respondent.  Hiralal filed some proceeding before civil Judge claiming possession of said land from respondent.  When the suit was pending certificate of ownership under S.32G came to be issued in favour of Hiralal on 11-6-71.  The proceedings were dismissed solely on the ground that possession of respondent was protected under S.53A of  T.P.Act.\n\nHeld, that the agreement of sale in favour of respondent was illegal by virtue of S.43 (2) of Act and protection of S.53A of T.P. Act was not available.  [Para 9]\n\nThe provisions of Section 29(1) are attracted for claiming repossession of the suit land from the original landlord and the said provisions are not applicable when the repossession of the suit land is being sought from a third person.  [Para 6]\n\nSection 43(1) of the Tenancy Act clearly lays down that the land purchased by a tenant U/s 32F shall not be transferred by sale etc. without the previous sanction of the Collector, whereas sub-section 2 of the said Section invalidates any such transfer which has been effected without the previous sanction of the Collector.  The contract for sale of such land of which the tenant has become the owner will be invalid in view of the provisions of Section 23 of the Contract Act, because it contravenes the provisions of Section 43(1) of the Tenancy Act.  It is therefore, clear that the agreement of sale is illegal by virtue of Section 43(2) of the Tenancy Act.  The Respondent is therefore, not entitled to protection of Section 53A of the Transfer of Property Act.  [Para 8,9]\n\nIn the instant case Hiralal was a tenant on the tiller's day.  A certificate of ownership U/s 32G of the Act was issued to him only on 11.6.71 and it is therefore, clear that Hiralal became the owner of the subject land only on 11.6.71, whereas the agreement of sale in favour of Respondent was signed on 16.3.61 and also the possession of the suit land was handed over to him in March/April 1961 itself.  This sale therefore was invalid.  Further the statutory mandate indicates that even after the ownership certificate is issued U/s 32G in favour of the tenant, the tenant is required to cultivate the land personally and his failure to do so results in his eviction from the said land.  The ownership vested in favour of the purchaser-tenant is thus not absolute but is conditional and Hiralal did not have an absolute right to enter into an agreement even after the certificate of ownership U/s 32G was issued to him.

Thus, any suit property while suit (not a collusive suit) is pending in a Court of law cannot be transferred unless the Court concerned has permitted the transfer pendente lite.  The Court while granting permission may authorize transfer pending the suit upon such terms as it may deem just.  In the instant case when special civil suit was decided by the trial Court no legal proceedings in respect of the suit property was pending.  The trial Court also failed to notice that the claim of  adverse  possession  in a pending proceeding on the date of the institution of the suit was based upon permissive possession which can never be termed as adverse possession.  Even otherwise, the effect of lis pendens is not annul the conveyance but only to make it subservient to rights of the parties to litigation.  The evidence of the plaintiff and her witnesses in the trial Court went unchallenged as the suit had proceeded further ex parte against the defendants.  Under these circumstances, possession ought to have followed the title which vested in the plaintiff under the registered sale deed and her name was also entered in the record as owner of suit plot pursuant thereto.\t [Para 7,8]"

It was not open for the trial court to grant leave to the applicants to deposit the amount even after the period stipulated in the preliminary decree has expired.

There does not appear to be any good ground for extending the time for depositing the amount.

                "description": "Deed of licence - Parties to document can show that what was intended was landlord and tenant relationship and deed was styled as a deed of licence.\n\nThough a deed of licence may have been executed it is open for the parties to the document to show that the relationship which was agreed upon by the parties and was really intended to be brought into existence was that of a landlord and tenant though it was outwardly styled as a deed of licence to act as a camouflage on the Rent Control Legislation. 'Lease' is defined in Section 105 of the Transfer of Property Act 1882. Generally speaking the difference between a 'lease' and 'licence' is to be determined by finding out the real intention of the parties as decipherable from a complete reading of the document, if any, executed between the parties and the surrounding circumstances. Only a right to use the property in a particular way or under certain terms given to the occupant while the owner retains the control or possession over the premises results in a licence being created; for the owner retains legal possession while all that the licensee gets is a permission to use the premises for a particular purpose or in a particular manner and but for the permission so given the occupation would have been unlawful. (2002)5 SCC 361 Rel.   [Para 8]\n\nUser of the terms like 'lease' or 'licence', 'lessor' or 'licensor', 'rent' or 'licence fee' are not by themselves decisive of the nature of the right created by the document. An effort should be made to find out whether the deed confers a right to possess exclusively coupled with transfer of a right to enjoy the property what has been parted with is merely a right to use the property while the possession is retained by the owner. The conduct of the parties before and after the creation of relationship is of relevance for finding out their intention.   [Para 9]\n\nIn this case the premises were located in a busy commercial market. The appellant has exclusive possession over the premises and the owner neither can nor does interfere therein. A full fledged stationery shop and allied business activities have been carried on by the appellant in the premises ever since 1972. The appellant was in possession of the premises for about 20 years before the date of the deed of licence and in spite of the 'deed of license' of 1981 having been executed continued to possess use and enjoy the occupation of premises as before. Though the so-called licence expired in 1982 the respondent did not insist on the appellant putting back the respondent in possession of the premises but allowed him to remain in occupation and to continue to do so for a period of about seven years till the date of the institution of the suit. It is thus clear that the present one is not a case where the possession or control of the premises was retained by the respondent while the appellant was only permitted to make such use of the premises as would have been unlawful but for the permission given. Hence the parties were landlord and tenant and possession of appellant over the premises was that of a tenant. [Para 12]"

It disentitles the transferor from disturbing the possession of the proposed transferee who is put in possession in pursuance to such an agreement. It has nothing to do with the ownership of the proposed transferor who remains full owner of the property till it is legally conveyed by executing a registered sale deed in favour of the transferee. Such a right to protect possession against the proposed vendor cannot be pressed in service against a third party.  [Para 10]\n\nDoctrine of part performance is rooted in equity and provides a shield of protection to the proposed transferee to remain in possession against the original owner who has agreed to sell to the transferee if the proposed transferee satisfies other conditions of Section 53-A. It operates as an equitable estoppel against the original owner to seek possession of the property which was given to the proposed vendee in part performance of the contract. Appellant being a third party and not a privy to the transaction on which the estoppel rests can take no advantage of it.\n\n\"P\" did not have a transferable interest which he could convey to the appellant by entering into an agreement of sale with the appellant. The appellant under the circumstances does not have the equitable right to protect his possession as against the owner of the land, i.e. the respondent. Appellant is not the transferee within the meaning of Section 53-A. The appellant did not get the possessory of equitable title to the suit land through \"P\" as \"P\" himself did not have any right in the property. The only right possessed by the \"P\" under Section 53-A was to protect his possession as against his proposed vendee. He did not have conveyable interest in the property which he could transfer to a third party including the possession of the property.  [Para 14,15]"

The Section only postulates a condition that the alienation will in no manner affect the rights of the other party under any decree which may be passed in the suit unless the property was alienated with the permission of the Court.

                "description": "Lease or licence - To be determined on the basis of the intention of the parties - Lease in favour of the statutory tenant cannot empower the tenant to sublet the premises to third parties in the absence of such right conferred on him.\n\nIt is nowhere pleaded that the deed executed between the parties is a camouflage to evade the rigours of the provisions of the Rent Act nor is it stated that a sham document is executed for achieving some other purpose. In these set of circumstances, the intention of the parties is required to be gathered from the express words of various terms provided by them in the deed. For this purpose, clause 12 of the document is to be taken into consideration and due weight is required to be given to what parties have stated. It provides as under :\n\n\"12. It is hereby expressly agreed upon and declared by and between the parties that these presents shall not be treated or used or dealt with or construed by the parties in any way as a tenancy or lease or as a document within the purview of the West Bengal Premises Tenancy Act or any modification or amendment thereof or to confer any relationship as landlord and tenant between the parties hereto.\"\n\nThe aforesaid term of the document is not provided by an illiterate layman or poor person in need of some premises for his residence or business, but is executed by two companies, where it can be presumed that it is mentioned after full understanding and to avoid any wrong inference of intention. It specifically mentions that only a license was created and not a lease. The said clause is in positive as well as negative form providing that the agreement was a licence and should not be treated or used or dealt with or construed by the parties in any way as lease or to confer any relationship as landlord and tenants between the parties. When the parties which are capable of understanding their rights fully, expressly agreed and declared that document should not be construed in any manner as creating any relationship as landlord and tenant between them, it would be impermissible to conjecture or infer that their relations should be construed as that of landlord and tenant because of certain terms mentioned in the deed can have double intendment. As stated above, intention of the parties is the meaning of the words they have used and there could be no intention independent of that meaning. The learned single Judge of the High Court rightly, therefore, held that this clause stares in his face in construing it as a lease deed.\n\nSecondly, parties to the document were fully aware that lease or sub-lease could not be granted and therefore, specific provision is made in the deed that if the consent of the tenant is obtained for creation of sub-lease, deed for the same would be executed on the terms and conditions which were set out in the document; detailed provisions are made in various clauses of the deed for obtaining permission and execution of lease deed. Parties were conscious that a lawful lease deed could be executed only after obtaining consent of the landlord and the document if treated as sub-lease, would be illegal\n\nThirdly, no contention was raised by the defendants to the effect that license deed is a camouflage to circumvent the provisions of law or to defeat the rights of owner or tenant who granted the licence and inducted and licensee in possession. Further, in cases where contract for licence is executed by handing over exclusive possession of the premises, the distinguishing line between the lease and licence is absolutely thin. In such cases, the terms of the document are to be read as they are and it would be unreasonable to draw inference that parties intended to create relationship of landlord and tenant despite express contrary terms in the deed which are binding between the parties."

Act - Suit will be decided by Civil Court.\n\nPeriod of lease was of 61 years, commencing from 1-1-1943. Hence determination of lease by efflux of time after lapse of 61 years with effect from 31-12-2003, could not be at any point of time prior to expiry of lease period. Cause of action for filing suit for eviction and possession on such ground under S.111(a) of Transfer of Property Act, did not arise at any point of time prior to 31-12-2003, Rent Control Legislations were not in force, as it was repealed by provisions of S.58(1)(b) of Maharashtra Rent Control Act 1999, with effect from 31-3-2000.\n\nRegular Civil Suit was filed for eviction and possession on 11-6-1997 on ground of breach of terms and conditions of lease agreement. Tenancy was thus terminable at option of lessor. Hence, such suit was not maintainable on 11-06-1997 without permission of Rent Controller under provision of Cl. 13(i)(a) of Rent Control Order, which was then in force. Suit as was formulated and filed, was required to be dismissed on that sole ground. However, fact remained that suit was not dismissed, but it remained pending till Maharashtra Rent Control Act was brought into force on 31-03-2000 by repealing earlier Rent Control Legislation, which was prevailing.\n\nPlaintiff filed application for amendment on 20-06-2005, introduction new ground for determination of lease by efflux of time, in Regular Civil Suit. Application was allowed by Trial Court on 2-7-2005. In facts and circumstances of case effect of amendment was that it was suit instituted on 20-06-2005 for eviction and possession of suit property on basis of cause of action which arose on 31-12-2003. Obviously, for reasons stated in earlier para, only Civil Court had jurisdiction to entertain, try and decide such suit and neither proceedings under repealed Rent Control Legislations, nor under Maharashtra Rent Control Act could be instituted. Hence it is held that ordinary jurisdiction of Civil Court was available to pass decree in Regular Civil Suit for eviction and possession between respondent no. 1 landlord and appellant tenant in respect of open land on ground of lease coming to end by efflux of time, introduced by way of amendment on 2-7-2005.\n\n2009 (1) ALL MR 602, 2002 (Suppl) Bom.

The charge is available against the seller and all persons claiming under him. This charge in favour of the buyer is the converse of the seller's charge under Section 55(4)(b). The buyer's charge under this section is a statutory charge and differs from a contractual charge which a buyer may be entitled to claim under a separate contract. No charge is available unless the agreement is genuine. The charge on the property under Section 55(6)(b) is enforceable not only against the seller but against all persons claiming under him. Before the amending Act of 1929, the words 'with notice of payment' occurred after the words \"all the persons claiming under him.\" These words were omitted as they allowed a transferee without notice to escape. After the Amendment of 1929, notice to the purchaser has now become irrelevant.\n\n When the property upon which the charge is created gets converted into another form, the buyer will be entitled to proceed against the substituted security. This is a general principle of law and Section 73 of the Transfer of Property Act is only an example of the said principle. The above principle has been applied to enforce mortgage on substituted securities. The same principle which is applicable to mortgages applies to cases of statutory charge under Section 55(6)(b). If immovable property is charge and is converted into another property or money, then the charge will fasten on the property or money into which the subject matter of the agreement is converted.\n\nThe sub-section (6) of Section 55 also makes it clear that the buyer is entitled to interest on the amount of purchase money paid. Interest is payable from the date of payment of the purchase money to the seller till date of delivery of property to the purchaser or till the execution of the sale deed, whichever is earlier.

Exclusive possession by itself would not militate against the concept of a licence, if the circumstances negative any intention to create a tenancy.   [Para 16]\n\n\tIn the instant case, the nomenclature or the label for the arrangement is unambiguous.  It is only a licence.  Clause (5) of the agreement specifically provides that nothing herein contained shall create or be construed to create any tenancy or to confer or be construed to confer upon the licensee any interest in the said cottage or any part thereof, and the said cottage shall continue or be deemed to continue to remain in the possession of the licensor.  Clause (6) provides that this licence is personal to the licensee and is not capable of and shall not be assigned by the licensee to any other person.  No right or interest whatsoever in the premises or any part thereof is created in favour of the defendant.  One thing is clear that the Bombay Rent Act was in existence ever since 1947.  The plaintiff as well as the defendant were aware and should be deemed to be aware of the prevailing state of law.  They chose to call the arrangement as a licence.  The initial period of licence was for 11 months and thereafter the licence was renewed from time to time till the period under the last licence agreement expired in 1969.  The exclusive possession by itself will not amount to creation of interest and it will not militate against the concept of a licence if the circumstances negative any intention to create any interest.  In the circumstances, it is not possible to accept the view taken by the Single Judge that the fact that the defendant was placed in exclusive possession indicates the intention of the parties to create a lease.  The fact that the defendant was a stranger to deceased licensor or that she was having another premises for her residence also would not militate against the concept of leave and licence.   [Para 17]\n\nFurther, the licence in favour of defendant expired in June, 1969.  Thus the licence in favour of the defendant was not subsisting on the relevant date and as such the defendant cannot be treated as deemed tenant under section 15A of the Bombay Rent Act.\n [Para 22]"

Ordinarily the Court should be reluctant to ignore such a term of the lease, unless on a fair reading and reasonable construction no meaning can be attached to it. Since the renewal clause is not clear and specific regarding the terms of renewal the Court is to ascertain the intention of the parties from the materials on record. The lease deed read as a whole, does not indicate the manner in which the right of renewal is to be exercised by the parties and the terms and conditions of such renewal. It is not even stated in the document that the renewal will be subject to terms and conditions to-be decided by the parties by mutual discussion or according to any other procedure. There is no indication whether such discussion will at all be held or not. Renewal being an important condition of lease, could not have been dealt with in such careless and slipshod manner and would not have been left in such vague and uncertain condition if the parties were serious about the renewal of the lease. On appreciation of the evidence the Courts below having not believed the case of the defendants that some verbal requests for renewal of the lease were made by them to the plaintiff after expiry of the period of lease, the Courts have found that no attempt was made by the lessees to suggest the terms and conditions for renewal of the lease particularly the rent to be paid by them except offering the rent for two months at the old rate. In such circumstances, if the Courts below have found that the lessees had no enforceable right of renewal under the document and indeed had not taken any step for execution by any document on renewal of the lease, no exception can be taken to such findings. No fixed principle or straight jacket formula can be laid down regarding the question whether the condition of renewal of the lease, which is vague and uncertain should be enforced. The question is to be Judged on the facts and circumstances of each case.  [Para 12]"

The principle underlying the above provision is a trite principle of justice, equity and good conscience. The charge would last until the conveyance is executed by the seller and possession is also given to the purchaser and ceases only thereafter. The charge will not be lost by merely accepting delivery of possession alone. This charge is a statutory charge in favour of a buyer and is different from contractual charge to which the buyer may become entitled to under the terms of the contract, and in substance a converse to the charge created in favour of the seller under Section 55(4)(b). Consequently, the buyer is entitled to enforce the said charge against the property and for that purpose trace the property even in the hands of third parties and even when the property is converted into another form by proceeding against the substituted security, since none claiming under the seller including a third party purchaser can take advantage of any plea based even on want of notice of the charge. The said statutory charge gets attracted and attaches to the property for the benefit of the buyer the moment he pays any part of the purchase money and is only lost in case of purchaser's own default or his improper refusal to accept delivery. So far as payment of interest is concerned, the section specifically envisages payment of interest upon the purchase-money/price prepaid, though not so specifically on the earnest money deposit, apparently for the reason that an amount paid as earnest money simplicitor, as mere security for due performance does not become repayable till the contract or agreement got terminated and it is shown that the purchaser has not failed to carry out his part of the contract, and the termination was brought about not due to his fault, the claim of the purchaser for refund of earnest money deposit will not arise for being asserted.

Consequently, in view of Section 59 of the TP Act when there is a mortgage other than a mortgage by deposit of the title deeds, it can be effected only by a registered instrument. So far as the present case is concerned, no registered mortgage deed was executed by the first respondent and no title deed of the property was handed over by the first respondent to the Corporation. The mere undertaking that a person would not dispose of the properties mentioned, during the currency of the loan, would not confer any charge on the immovable properties mentioned therein.

In order to get the benefit of the said provision, the conditions which must be satisfied are: (1) the contract of transfer was made by a person who was competent to contract; and (2) the contract would be subsisting at the time when a claim for recovery of the property is made. However, the provisions would have no application if the transfer was invalid as being forbidden by law or contrary to public policy, as envisaged under Section 23 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Thus, no estoppel can be pleaded contrary to the provisions of a statute. The 'rule of feeding the estoppel' shall apply in absence thereof. The doctrine of feeding the estoppel envisages that 'where a grantor has purported to grant an interest in land which he did not at the time possess, but subsequently acquires, the benefit of his subsequent acquisition, goes automatically to the earlier grantee, or as it is usually expressed, feeds the estoppel'. The principle is based on an equitable doctrine that a person who promised to perform more than he can perform must make good his contract when he acquires the power of performance. Section 43 enables the transferee to whom a transferor has made a fraudulent or erroneous representation to lay hold, at his option, of any interest which the transferor may subsequently acquire in the property, unless the right of any subsequent purchaser for value without notice is in effect.\t [Para 10,11,12,13,14]"

The question is always of intention of the parties.  The extraneous evidence can be considered only when the terms of the documents are vague.  However, if the terms of the document are clear enough then it is not necessary to consider the other evidence.  In the present case, there was no concession granted as such.  What is explicit from the terms of the document is that if the mortgage amount is returned within period of five years, then mortgage will be redeemed and if it is not so done, then document itself would be treated as sale.  Obviously, understanding between parties to the document was clear.  They intended to bring about mortgage.  It is not a case where right of ownership was transferred in favour of said Vasantrao Neb or his father.  The amount was also referred as \"mortgage amount\" (i|\u00b2ee\u00a2r j'kc). The condition incorporated in the document is to the effect that in case the mortgage money would not be paid within five years period, the document will be deemed as sale.  In other words, the transaction was not of out and out sale, when the document was brought about.  No right of ownership had passed in favour of the mortgagee.  Then, deceased Shankarrao had not recognized the fact that his interest in the property was relinquished due to such transaction.  The document clearly supports the condition which creates clog on redemption of the mortgage.  There is no substratum on record to reach conclusion that the parties intended to sell the suit house property by giving concession to deceased Shankarrao to repurchase the same on certain condition.

                "description": "Scope - Suit simpliciter by prospective transferee in possession seeking decree for perpetual injunction restraining transferor from disturbing possession - Maintainable - It amounts to enforcement of bar under S.53-A and using shield to protect possession and does not amount to enforcement of any rights by transferee.\n\nA suit simpliciter filed by a prospective transferee under S.53-A seeking a decree of perpetual injunction against the Defendant, who is transferor, restraining him from disturbing the possession of the Plaintiff is maintainable. When the transferee has complied with all the conditions necessary in terms of S.53-A of the T.P. Act, he is entitled to claim equity under S.53-A to protect his possession of the suit property. [Para 5,7,14]\n\nSection 53-A disentitles the transferor from seeking possession from the proposed transferee in possession.  Therefore, if the transferor, though he has been denied that right by Section 53-A, tries to take possession forcibly, the proposed transferee in possession would be entitled to institute a suit to enforce the bar of Section 53-A against the transferor.  In such a situation, when the proposed transferee in possession comes to the court seeking a decree of perpetual injunction restraining the transferor from disturbing his possession, he does not come to the court for enforcement of any rights conferred on him, but he comes to the court for enforcement of the bar created by Section 53-A against the transferor.   [Para 11]\n\nWhen it is said that the proposed transferee in possession can use Section 53-A as a shield, but not as a sword, it means that he can use Section 53-A either as a Plaintiff or as a Defendant to protect his possession, but he cannot use Section 53-A either for getting title or for getting possession if he is not actually in possession.  To put it in other words, when the transferee in possession comes to the court as a Plaintiff seeking a decree of perpetual injunction against the transferor he is using Section 53-A as a shield to protect his possession.  It is thus clear that the proposed transferee in possession cannot use Section 53-A to sue the transferor for a declaration of title, but he can avail of benefits of Section 53-A as a shield to retain his possession.\t [Para 11]\n\nThe question whether a suit of particular nature is maintainable or not has to be decided with reference to the provisions of Section 9 of CPC. No provision of law expressly bars the jurisdiction of the civil court to entertain such suit.\t [Para 13]\n\nEven if it is assumed that the cause of action for instituting a suit for a decree of specific performance had accrued and the Plaintiff in that case omitted to institute the suit for specific performance, then also by virtue of the provisions of Order 2 Rule 2 of CPC the suit of the Plaintiff for a decree of specific performance would be barred, but his suit for a decree of perpetual injunction for protecting his possession would not be barred.  Occasion for a prospective purchaser in possession to institute a suit for perpetual injunction for protecting his possession may arise even when the cause of action for instituting the suit for specific performance has not arisen or where it is barred by the law of limitation.   [Para 13]\n\nIt is clear that in a situation where a suit for a decree for specific performance is barred by the Law of Limitation, the prospective purchaser in possession would not be in a position to institute a suit for decree of specific performance, but Section 53-A creates an equity in his favour, as a result of which he is entitled to continue in possession.  If it is held that though his possession is protected, he cannot institute a suit in case he finds that his possession has been threatened that would amount to denying a remedy for enforcing the equity which is created in his favour by Section 53-A.  In a case where the prospective purchaser has a live cause of action for instituting a suit for specific performance, he omits to institute such a suit, and instead files a suit only for perpetual injunction for protection of his possession, in that situation it is for the Court to consider whether to grant him a decree of perpetual injunction or not.  But that will be in the realm of exercise of the jurisdiction.  It will not be a case of absence of jurisdiction to entertain the suit.  Therefore, there is nothing in Specific Relief Act also which can be said to have barred the jurisdiction of the civil court to take cognizance of such a suit even by necessary implications.\t\t\t\t\t\t  [Para 13]"

But this is not an invariable rule, as the true test of passing of property is the intention of parties. Though registration is prima facie proof of an intention to transfer the property, it is not proof of operative transfer if payment of consideration (price) is a condition precedent for passing of the property. The answer to the question whether the parties intended that transfer of the ownership should be merely by execution and registration of the deed or whether they intended the transfer of the property to take place, only after receipt of the entire consideration, would depend on the intention of the parties. Such intention is primarily to be gathered and determined from the recitals of the sale deed. When the recitals are insufficient or ambiguous the surrounding circumstances and conduct of parties can be looked into for ascertaining the intention, subject to the limitations placed by Section 92 of Evidence Act. In the present case, though the sale deed recites that the purchaser is entitled to hold, possess and enjoy the scheduled properties from the date of sale, neither the possession of the properties nor the title deeds were delivered to the purchaser either on the date of sale or thereafter. It is admitted that possession of the suit properties purported to have been sold under the sale deed was never delivered to the appellant and continued to be with the respondents. In fact, the appellant, therefore, sought a decree for possession of the suit properties from the respondents with mesne profits. If really the intention of the parties was that the title to the properties should pass to the appellant on execution of the deed and its registration, the possession of the suit properties would have been delivered to the appellant.

The plaintiff claiming having obtained possession on the basis of lease on 17-4-1998.  The lease was denied by defendants who had pleaded that plaintiff had been entrusted with some renovation work for which he was being paid and alleged document relied on by him was a concocted one.  The grant of mandatory injunction would necessarily depend upon plaintiff establishing before the court that on 19-6-98 when the court directed the parties to maintain status quo, he was in possession as a tenant of the plaint schedule property.  The burden in that behalf is clearly on the plaintiff, the claim he made, having been denied by the defendants.  Prima facie it is difficult to imagine that a building of substantial dimension located in commercially important part of the city would have been let out in such an informal manner and the transaction not being evidenced even by a rent deed executed by the lessor and the lessee in terms of Section 107 of the Transfer of Property Act.  It is difficult to imagine that the letter-head of one company was used for dealing with the properties of another entity which appears to be a partnership as per the description contained in the letter.  Prima facie, the document does not satisfy the requirements of Section of Transfer of Property Act and though it acknowledges receipt of a sum of Rs.2 lakhs, there is no stamp affixed to indicate that it was intended to be a receipt for the said sum.  The genuineness of this document which is seriously disputed by the defendants, its admissibility in evidence and validity, have to be decided in the suit.  Therefore, one of the questions that has to be decided is whether this letter is genuine and if it is genuine, whether it is capable of bringing into existence a lease or accepted as evidencing a lease transaction between the parties.  Since this is the document on which the suit is based, the finding on the genuineness and validity of this document and the alleged transaction created by it will have a great bearing on the claim of possession by the plaintiff.  No doubt the signature of defendant No.1 found in the document is admitted but with an explanation that it is a got up document.  A suit has also been filed by the defendants challenging it.  [Para 6]\n\nThe plaintiff claiming that he had been put in possession as a tenant and that the defendants were attempting to dispossess him forcibly.  The plaintiff filed the suit for a declaration of his tenancy rights over the suit property and for a perpetual injunction restraining the defendants from interfering with his possession as a tenant.  Though the plaintiff filed an application for an interim injunction, the trial court did not pass an ad interim order of injunction, but only issued notices to the defendants calling upon them to show cause why the prayer for injunction shall not be granted.  Against this refusal of ad interim injunction ex-parte, plaintiff filed appeal.  Additional District Judge on 19-6-1998 passed ad interim ex-parte order directing both the parties to maintain status quo.  In an original suit of this nature, it was not appropriate for the Additional District Judge to pass an order directing the parties to maintain status quo, without indicating what the status quo was.  Simply directing parties to maintain status quo without incating what the status quo was, is not an order that should be passed at the initial stage of a litigation, especially when one court had found no reason to grant an ex-parte order of injunction and the appellate court was dealing with only the limited question whether an ad interim order of injunction should or should not have been granted by the trial court, since the appeal was only against the refusal of an ad interim ex-parte order of injunction and the main application for injunction pending suit, was still pending before the trial court itself.  Therefore, the Additional District Judge ought not to have passed an equivocal order like the one passed in the circumstances of the case.  But of course, that aspect has relevance only to the extent that before ordering an interim mandatory injunction or refusing it, the court has first to consider whether the plaintiff has proved that he was in possession on the date of suit and on the date of the order and he had been dispossessed the next day.  Unless a clear prima facie finding that the plaintiff was in possession on those dates is entered, an order for interim mandatory injunction could not have been passed and any such order passed would be one without jurisdiction.

Both the documents relate to the same property and were executed simultaneously on the same day.  The loan amount was required to be repaid by 6-6-1953 and thereafter the property was required to be re-conveyed.  The appellant, however, failed to pay the loan by 6-6-1953.  It was a specific case of the appellant that since the appellant was unable to repay the amount within stipulated period, there was an oral agreement entered between the parties under which the possession of the half of the suit property was delivered to the respondent on condition that he should enjoy the same for a period of 12 years and  thereafter the possession should be redelivered to the appellant and the income derived by the respondent during the said period of 12 years from the said part of the suit property should be appropriated towards the recovery of the loan amount payable by the appellant to the respondent.  The specific plea in that regard raised in the pleadings and duly corroborated by the testimony of the appellant has not been controverted or disproved by the respondent.\n\nHeld, that all the facts duly established by cogent evidence on record have been totally ignored by the lower courts and merely on presumption that whatever has been stated in the concerned document of 27-8-1952 discloses the real transaction, have proceeded to hold that by the said deed the property was conveyed in favour of the respondent and in that sense, the document is a sale deed.  The finding arrived at by both the courts being contrary to the records as well as the settled law applicable to the facts of the case, the same can not be sustained and is liable to be set aside and it is to be held that the deed in question was purely towards security for repayment of the loan which was borrowed by the appellant from the respondent.  Being so, there was no right of ownership acquired by the respondent to the suit property on the date when the suit was filed and therefore, respondent was not entitled to seek partition or ownership share in the suit property and therefore the suit was liable to be dismissed.    [Para 18]\n\nThe document in question i.e.  Deed dated 27-8-1952 is undoubtedly stated to be a sale deed and it is also registered document.  Being so certainly there is presumption as regards the document having been executed by the parties.  However, merely because a document is a registered document, and merely because it is referred to as a sale deed, there is no presumption regarding the correctness of the recitals in such document.  In a case where the correctness of recitals in such document is disputed, burden lies upon the party seeking to rely upon the correctness of the recitals in such document to establish the same with cogent evidence.

A legal fiction is created thereby that the transaction shall not be held to be a mortgage by conditional sale, unless a condition is embodied in the document which effects or purports to effect the sale.

In a case of this nature, ordinarily the same would be considered to be a deed of sale coupled with an agreement of reconveyance.\n\nIn the instant case, no relationship of debtor or creditor came into being.  No security was created and in fact conveyance of the title of the property by the respondent to the appellant was final and absolute.\n\nIf the transaction is really one of mortgage then the second deed would be inadmissible for want of registration; but where the transaction is not one of mortgage, the second document would not need registration, even if it is a part of the same transaction of sale.\n\nIn this case also the transaction is a mortgage by conditional sale and having regard to the provisions of Section 18 of the Indian Registration Act, the agreement of sale was not compulsorily registerable.

That the said defendants took all necessary steps to investigate the title of the suit property and since were satisfied that there was no claim of any other person, proceeded to purchase the property. That will be of no avail. For, if the defendant no.1 had no right of any nature to deal with the suit property after the execution of the Conveyance Deed in favour of Veer Bahadur dated 15.4.1988, in terms of section 19 of the Specific Relief Act, the defendant nos.5 and 6 cannot claim any higher right.

Transfer by ostensible owner.- Where, with the consent, express or implied, of the persons interested in immoveable property, a person is the ostensible owner of such property and transfers the same for consideration, the transfer shall not be voidable on the ground that the transferor was not authorised to make it: provided that the transferee, after taking reasonable care to ascertain that the transferor had power to make the transfer, has acted in good faith.\"\n\nIt was argued that insofar as these defendant nos.5 and 6 are concerned, that they had purchased the property from the defendant no.1 who was the ostensible owner of the suit property. For, the name of the defendant no.1 continues to appear in the Record of Rights as well as other relevant revenue records.

                "description": "Pre-emption - Suit for, on ground of vicinage - Maintainability of, when only an agreement for sale of property was entered into by defendant-1/appellant-3 with appellants 1 and 2 - Held, in terms of Section 54 a mere agreement to sell, creates no interest in suit property in favour of vendee - Unless title to suit property has passed in accordance with Act, no right to enforce pre-emption arises - Therefore, suit for pre-emption brought on basis of such an agreement was without any cause of action as there was no right of pre-emption in respondents which could be enforced under law - Mohammedan Law or any other personal law of transfer of property cannot override Act - Right of pre-emption, a weak right and not looked upon with favour by Courts and therefore courts cannot go out of their way to help pre-emptor.\n\nSection 54 of the Transfer of Property Act says that a contract for sale does not, of itself, create any interest in or charge on immoveable property.  Therefore, where the parties enter into a mere agreement to sell, it creates no interest in the suit property in favour of the vendee and the proprietary title does not validly pass from the vendors to the vendee and until that is completed no right to enforce pre-emption arises.  Therefore, the suit for pre-emption brought on the basis of such an agreement was without any cause of action as there was no right of pre-emption in the respondents which could be enforced under the law.  The transfer of property, where the Transfer of Property Act applies, has to be under the provisions of the Act only and Mohammedan Law or any other personal law of transfer of property cannot override the statute.  Therefore, unless title to the suit property has passed in accordance with the Act, no right to enforce pre-emption arises.  Therefore, in view of the admitted fact that merely agreement for sale was entered into by the appellant No.3 with the appellant Nos.1 and 2 in respect of the suit property, the question of exercising any right of pre-emption in the respondents could not arise at all, a suit for pre-emption brought on the basis of such an agreement for sale must be held to be without any cause of action as there was no right of pre-emption in the respondents which could be enforced under the law.  There are no equities in favour of a pre-emptor, whose sole object is to disturb a valid transaction by virtue of the rights created in him by statute.  It would be open to the pre-emptee, to defeat the law of pre-emption by any legitimate means, which is not fraud on the part of either the vendor or the vendee and a person is entitled to steer clear of the law of pre-emption by all lawful means.  That apart, it is now well settled that the right of pre-emption is a weak right and is not looked upon with favour by courts and therefore the courts cannot go out of their way to help the pre-emptor.  AIR 1960 SC 1368 - Rel on.   [Para 11,12]\n\nSuch being the position, the right of pre-emption was not available to the respondents.  If ultimately the sale deed is executed, it would be open for the respondents to apply for pre-emption of the suit property, if under the law they are permitted to maintain the suit for pre-emption.

In other words, the mere act of the lessor showing an intention to treat the lease as subsisting is not sufficient to constitute a waiver. That action must have the express or implied consent of the lessee whose consent to the act must exist.  [Para 6]\n\nThere is no doubt that the appellate authority has refused permission to the respondent to terminate the tenancy and the respondent had, therefore, challenged that order by a Writ Petition.  This was on the basis that there was a lease in existence.  However, what section 113 requires is an \"intention to treat the lease as subsisting\" i.e. something more than a mere acknowledgment of the mere existence of the lease. What is necessary is that the act must show an intention on the part of the lessor to treat the lease as subsisting. The respondent had initiated the proceedings before the quit notice which took effect from 31-8-1982. The rest of the proceedings were a mere continuation  and the Writ Petition must in this sense be treated as a continuation of the same proceedings. It does not apper that by the mere filing of the Writ Petition, the lessor intended to continue the lease to treat the lease as subsisting. Even otherwise, it is equally important that there was no consent on  the part of the appellant that the respondent's act of filing the Writ petition which is an act to show the intention to treat the lease as subsisting. Admittedly, the appellant-tenant has done no act such as the payment of rent by the appellant to show that the appellant intended to treat the lease as subsisting.   [Para 7]\n\nHence it is not possible in this case to infer consent on the part of the appellant to have the notice waived and treat the lease as subsisting.  The parties were not of one mind.  For such an inference, there must be a clearest - indication that the recipient of the notice intended and consented to have the notice given to him waived and an agreement on the part of both in respect of such waiver. Thus, to qualify for S.113 of the Act. (1978 Mh.L.J.850 Ref.)\t\t [Para 6,7,10,11]"

In reaching a conclusion on this aspect of the matter, the Court must consider all relevant facts and circumstances, and the mere fact that rent has been tendered and accepted, cannot be determinative.   [Para 6]\n\nIn the instant case, two notices to quit were given on 10th February, 1979 and 17th March, 1979. The suit was filed on June 2, 1979. The tenant offered and the landlord accepted the rent for the months of April, May and thereafter. The question is whether this by itself constitute an act on the part of the landlord showing an intention to treat the lease as subsisting. In our view, mere acceptance of rent did not by itself constituted an act of the nature envisaged by section 113, Transfer of Property Act showing an intention to treat the lease as subsisting. The fact remains that even after accepting the rent tendered, the landlord did file a suit for eviction, and even while prosecuting the suit accepted rent which was being paid to him by the tenant. It cannot, therefore, be said that by accepting rent, he intended to waive the notice to quit and to treat the lease as subsisting. 2005(5) SCC 543 Rel on. AIR 1926 Cal 763 Overruled.   [Para 8]"

                "description": "Mortgage by conditional sale or sale with a condition of repurchase - Question whether a given transaction is a mortgage by conditional sale or a sale outright with a condition of repurchase is a vexed one and must be decided on its own facts - Intention of the parties is the determining factor - Deed - Construction.\n\nThe rule of law on this subject is one dictated by commonsense; that prima facie an absolute conveyance, containing nothing to show that the relation of debtor and creditor is to exist between the parties, does not cease to be an absolute conveyance and become a mortgage merely because the vendor stipulates that he shall have a right to repurchase. The converse also holds good and if, on the face of it, an instrument clearly purports to be a mortgage it cannot be turned into a sale by reference to a host of extraneous and irrelevant considerations. Difficulty only arises in the border line cases where there is ambiguity.\t [Para 5,7]\n\nUnder the Proviso to S.58(c). T. P. Act, if the sale and agreement to repurchase are embodied in separate documents, then the transaction cannot be a mortgage whether the documents are contemporaneously executed or not. But the converse does not hold good, that is to say, the mere fact that there is only one document does not necessarily mean that it must be a mortgage and cannot be a sale. If the condition of repurchase is embodied in the document that effects or purposes to effect the sale, then it is a matter for construction which was meant. The legislature has made a clear cut classification and excluded transactions embodied in more than one document from that category of mortgages, therefore, it is reasonable to suppose that persons who, after the amendment choose not to use two documents, do not intend the transaction to be a sale, unless they displace that presumption by clear and express words; and if the conditions of S.58(c) are fulfilled, then the deed should be construed as a mortgage. \t [Para 8]\n\nIn this case, the document was to the following effect; Rs.634 principal with interest under a registered rehan bond (simple mortgage) dated the 6th May 1927 is justly due... by us the executants. Now we further require Rs.65-6-0 more to meet costs of the suit under S.40. (Bihar Tenancy Act).. and at present there is no other way in view rather it seems impossible and difficult to arrange for the money without selling the property let out in rehan (simple mortgage) under the above mentioned bond. Therefore, we the executants... declare... that we ... sold and vended the properties detailed below on condition (given below) for fair and just price of Rs.700 ... That we set off Rs. 634-10-0 against the consideration money .... payable under the aforesaid bond in favour of the said endue and receive Rs. 65-6-0 in cash from the said vender. In this way the entire consideration money was realised from the said vendee. And we put the said vendede in possession and occupation of the vended property detailed below and made him an absolute proprietor in our places. If we, the executants, shall repay the consideration money to the said vendee within two years... the property vended under this deed of conditional sale attached shall come in exclusive possession and occupation of us, the executants. If we do not pay the same, the said vendee shall remain in possession and occupation thereof, generation after generation, and he shall appropriate the produce thereof, we, the executants, neither have nor shall have any objection whosoever in respect of the vended property and the consideration money. Perchance if we do so it shall be deemed null and void in Court. And we declare also that the vended property is flawless in every way and that if in future any kind of defect whatsoever be found on account of which the said vendee be dispossessed of a portion or the entire property vended under this deed of conditional sale and will have to pay the loss or damage, in that event we, the executants (a) shall be liable to be prosecuted under the criminal procedure, and (b) we shall pay the entire consideration money together with loss and damage and interest at the rate of Rs.2 per mensem per hundred rupees from the date of the execution of this deed till the date of relisation from our person and other properties. (c) and we shall not claim the produce of the vended property for the period of vendee's possession against the said vendee or his heirs and representatives. Therefore we, the executants... have executed this deed of conditional sale so that it may be of use in future. Held, on construction of the document and taking everything into consideration that the deed was a mortgage by conditional sale under S.58(c), T. P. Act.\t [Para 20]\n\nWhere a document has to be construed, the intention must be gathered, in the first place, from the document itself. If the words are express and clear, effect must be given to them and any extraneous enquiry into what was thought or intended is ruled out. The real question in such a case is not what the parties intended or meant but what is the legal effect of the words which they used. If, however, there is ambiguity in the language employed, then it is permissible to look to the surrounding circumstances to determine what was intended.\t [Para 6]"

A tax on income whether agricultural or non-agricultural is unless otherwise stipulated in the Act itself will be a tax on monetory return whether actual or notional. To be more explicit, it is relevant to state that agricultural income tax payable by the mortgagor cannot be held to be an assessment of tax made with reference to the extent of land mortgaged by him. What was assessed by way of agricultural income tax was based on the total agricultural income derived by the land holder from and out of the entirety of the land held by him which may also include the lands mortgaged. It cannot, therefore, be held that merely because, what was sought to be recovered was Agricultural Income Tax, such liability should be held to be linked to the property mortgaged. Even going by Section 76(c) of the Transfer of Property Act it can be easily visualized that what is noted as Government dues are charges of a public nature, rent accruing during the period of possession of the land in question including arrears, if any, default of which may result in bringing the property for sale. Certainly such liabilities noted and contemplated to be cleared by the mortgagee cannot and will not include the income tax liability of an assessee which is purely personal and not of a public nature. Therefore, Section 76(c) can have limited application to the specific Government dues of public nature as well as those which are referable to the land and not to the personal statutory dues of the owner of the land.

He had already settled with the Plaintiff for Rs.5,00,000/-.  The Suit was disposed off.  Creditors were knocking at his door.  He had to pay off Thakur to whom he owned moneys.  He also owed moneys to other parties.  He was convicted in a criminal case.  He was committed to prison.  He had to be released on bail.  He sought to enter into certain agreements for sale of his premises during the period he was in jail.  One of that premises is the Suit premises.  (The other premises was to be sold to Thakur, who is stated to have discharged his various debts).  Whilst he was in jail these documents were got prepared.  They could not be executed during that time.  There was a stalemate when the Petitioner wanted to purchase the Suit premises.  For discharge of his liability Defendant No.2 had to surrender possession of the Suit premises.  He entered into a kind of tripartite agreement under which he would surrender the Suit premises to the owner/builder.  The owner would agree to hand over possession to the Petitioner, the Petitioner would make payment of consideration to the owner.  The owner would pay Thakur and the owner would hand over possession of the Suit premises to the Petitioner.  Unless all the documents relating to this entire transaction are produced before the Court, the unique circumstances could not be shown to the Court.  Once that is seen, the fact that the Defendant No.2 was in jail in fact lends credence to the execution of the documents of the kind that are produced by the Petitioner as having been executed by the Defendant No.2.  Similarly the fact that the Defendant No.2 was hospitalized shows how a similar agreement containing the same requirements as of the Deed of Cancellation came to be notarised along with the left hand thumb impression of the Defendant No.2.  The fact that the original agreement itself is produced by the purchaser as a further circumstantial evidence which lends credence to his case.  If the Defendant No.2 had continued in possession as contended by him and if the Petitioner was not a bonafide occupant of the Suit premises, he would not have had the original Agreement for Sale dated 1st May, 1997 showing the purchase of Suit premises by the Defendant No.2.  The production by the Petitioner of the original receipts of MSEB soon after the purchase of the Suit premises for payment of the arrears of electricity as also for deposit or transfer to his name are further circumstantial evidence to prove his purchase and the subsequent possession.  Similarly the complaint made by the Defendant No.2 to the Assistant Commissioner of Police sought to be relied upon by him in fact shows the number of Creditors who were demanding vast amounts from the Petitioner, a few days after which the Petitioner executed the Deed of Cancellation.\n\nUpon seeing the documents hitherto suppressed the case of the Petitioner becomes clear.  It is unfortunate that at the time the Court Receiver's report came to be considered the Petitioner's case as the bonafide purchaser of the Suit premises for consideration could be fully appreciated.  The Petitioner had to get produced the documents not executed by him to prove his case, since this was a transaction of a unique nature as aforesaid. [Para 36,37]"

A lease of immovable property is a transfer of right to enjoy such property in consideration of price paid as per Section 105 of the T.P. Act. By way of lease, a right and interest is created which stands transferred in favour of the lessee. The immovable property, thereafter, only can be reverted back on determination of such right and interest in accordance with the provisions of the T.P. Act. Therefore, once the right of lease is transferred in favour of the lessee, the destruction of a house/building constructed on the lease property does not determine the tenancy rights of occupant which is incidental to the contract of the lease which continues to exist between the parties. Once a tenancy is created in respect of a building standing on the land it is the building and the land which are both components of the subject-matter of demise and the destruction of the building alone does not determine the tenancy when the land which is the site of the building continues to exist. This interpretation, as we find, is in accord with Section 108 of the Act.\n\n(2003) 5 SCC 150 Followed.\n\n2001(1) ALL MR 548 (S.C.) Overruled.

The lease was subsisting when the shares of the land were purchased by the respondent. But the interest of the lessee was not purchased by the respondent. What has been purchased by the respondent is the right and interest of ownership of the property. The interest of the appellant as lessee has not been vested with the respondent. Therefore, the tenancy of the appellant cannot be said to have been determined consequent upon demolition and destruction of the tenanted premises.     [Para 33]"

The loan was taken for personal use. In order to secure the repayment of the loan, the appellants had executed certain documents including the loan agreement. Fixed deposits were taken as collateral security under the agreement. The appellants paid a few instalments and thereafter stopped paying the Loan amount. The rate of interest payable on the loan amount varied from time to time. The appellants had in fact contested the suit mainly on the ground of rate of interest. The loan agreement clearly provided that if any amount remained unpaid after becoming payable, then in such an eventuality the Bank had absolute discretion to sell and realise the security/shares or any part thereof at such time and price without notice to the appellants and the said instalment could be realised by appropriating the sum from the Fixed Deposits. There was no impediment whatsoever to adjust the instalments payable out of the said collateral security nor the appellants raised any objection to do so. It was only after the filing of the suit that the collateral security amount along with interest was adjusted.\n\nHeld that the method of adjustment adopted by the Bank had adversely affected the appellants who, on account of non-application of the agreement by the Bank, were required to pay more interest on the loan than the one they earned on the Fixed Deposits. Therefore, keeping in view the provisions of the loan agreement, the Bank was required to adjust the instalment which was due every month from the collateral security which was available with the Bank.

The expression 'otherwise dealt with' by any party has a very wide meaning and any act or any mode of dealing with the subject-matter of the suit during the pendency of the suit or proceedings, which would adversely affect the rights of any other party thereto, under any decree or order that may eventually be passed in the suit, would fall under the said expression. In other words, any mode of dealing with the subject-matter of the suit, by any party to the lis, which would adversely affect the rights of any other party under any decree that may be passed, would be subject to the result of the suit. \t [Para 14]\n\n\tIn Wellingdon B. case (2014 (3) KHC 560), the Division Bench of this court has lost sight of the 2nd limb of section 52, \"otherwise dealt with by any party to the suit or proceedings so as to affect the right of any other party thereto under any decree or order, which may be made therein\". The said provision was not brought to the notice of the court, while rendering the judgment. So, the ratio laid down in Wellingdon B. case (supra) in respect of section 52 of the Act, is not a good law. Further, we also endorse the view expressed in Kubra Bibi's case (AIR 1917 Oudh 193) that creation of a contract capable of specific performance, though not an alienation by itself, is a mode of dealing with the property, pregnant with very mischief, which section 52 of the Act seeks to obviate.\n\nAIR 1917 Oudh 193 Rel. on. 2014 (3) KHC 560 Overruled. \t [Para 18]"

                "description": "Mortgage by conditional sale or sale with condition to repurchase - Determination - Executant-father of plaintiff alleged to have executed document titled \"mortgage by conditional sale\" for consideration of Rs. 2500/- as he needed money for marriage of his daughter - Record showing that executant already received Rs.700/- therefore, on date of execution of document he got only Rs. 1800/- - Said adjustment of Rs.700/- from total consideration of Rs.2500/- shows intention of parties to end debtor-creditor relationship with respect to sum of Rs.700/- and to create relationship of vendor and vendee by transfer of suit property for consideration of Rs.2500/- - Document on record showing that if amount is not repaid within period of five years, mortgage will be treated as absolute sale - Executant failed to repay amount within stipulated period - Executant never took any action during his life to get property reconveyed nor any immediate action was taken by his successor - Plaintiff produced receipt showing that Rs.800/- were paid to respondentdefendant - Said receipt was faded and bear incomplete thumb impression of issuer - No evidence adduced by plaintiff to prove receipt - Plaintiff failed to prove that receipt was genuine - It cannot be relied on - Document does not contain mention of rate of interest, right of foreclosure which are essential in deed of mortgage - Considering recitals of document, document is sale with condition to repurchase and not mortgage by conditional sale.\n\nS.58(c) of the Transfer of Property Act contains the definition of \u201cmortgage by conditional sale\u201d. In a \u201cmortgage by conditional sale\u201d, the transfer is made as a security to a loan taken by the mortgagorowner; whereas in a \u201csale with a condition to repurchase\u201d, the sale is made by the vendor-owner reserving with himself a right to repurchase it within a stipulated time. A sale with a condition of retransfer is not a mortgage since the relationship of debtor and creditor does not exist and there is no debt for which the transfer is made as a security. Whether the document is a \u201cmortgage by conditional sale\u201d or \u201csale with a condition to repurchase\u201d is to be ascertained from the intention of the parties. As per proviso to Section 58(c), if the sale and agreement to repurchase are embodied in the separate documents then the transaction cannot be a \u201cmortgage by conditional sale\u201d irrespective of whether the documents are contemporaneously executed; but the converse does not hold good. Observing that the mere fact that there is only one document, it does not necessarily mean that it must be a mortgage and cannot be a sale. The question in each case is the determination of the real character of the transaction to be ascertained from the provisions of the deed viewed in the light of the surrounding circumstances. If the words are plain and unambiguous then in the light of the evidence of the surrounding circumstances, it must be given their true legal effect. If there is any ambiguity in the language employed, the intention is to be ascertained from the contents of the deed and the language of the deed is to be taken into consideration to ascertain the intention of the parties. Evidence of contemporaneous conduct of the parties is to be taken into consideration as the surrounding circumstances.\n\nIn the present case, owner of property executed document titled \u2018mortgage by conditional sale\u2019 for consideration of Rs. 2,500/- as he needed money for marriage of daughter. Owner already received Rs. 700/- therefore, on date of execution of document he get only Rs. 1,800/-. Said adjustment of Rs. 700/- from total consideration of Rs. 2,500/- shows intention of parties to end debtor-creditor relationship with respect to sum of Rs. 700/- and to create relationship of vendor and vendee by transfer of suit property for consideration of Rs. 2,500/-. Recital of document showing that if amount is not repaid within period of five years, mortgage will be treated as absolute sale. Owner failed to repay amount within stipulated period. Also during his life he never took any action to get property reconveyed nor any immediate action was taken by his successor. Further, document does not contain mention of rate of interest, right of foreclosure which are essential in deed of mortgage. Considering recitals of document, document is sale with condition to repurchase and not mortgage by conditional sale. (Paras 13, 14, 16, 17, 18, 19, 23, 25, 27)"

Judicial pronouncements as to the true and correct interpretation of Section 123 of the T.P. Act have for a fairly long period held that Section 123 of the Act supersedes the rule of Hindu Law if there was any making delivery of possession an essential condition for the completion of a valid gift.\n\nAIR 1922 ALL 467 (FB) Rel. on.      [Para 11]\n\nSection 123 of the T.P. Act is in two parts. The first part deals with gifts of immovable property while the second part deals with gifts of movable property. Insofar as the gifts of immovable property are concerned, Section 123 makes transfer by a registered instrument mandatory. This is evident from the use of word \"transfer must be effected\" used by Parliament in so far as immovable property is concerned. In contradiction to that requirement the second part of Section 123 dealing with gifts of movable property, simply requires that gift of movable property may be effected either by a registered instrument signed as aforesaid or \"by delivery\". The difference in the two provisions lies in the fact that in so far as the transfer of movable property by way of gift is concerned the same can be effected by a registered instrument or by delivery. Such transfer in the case of immovable property no doubt requires a registered instrument but the provision does not make delivery of possession of the immovable property gifted as an additional requirement for the gift to be valid and effective. If the intention of the legislature was to make delivery of possession of the property gifted also as a condition precedent for a valid gift, the provision could and indeed would have specifically said so. Absence of any such requirement can only lead to the conclusion that delivery of possession is not an essential prerequisite for the making of a valid gift in the case of immovable property.\n\n2004(5) ALL MR 551 (S.C.) Rel. on.\n\n(1997) 2 SCC 255 Disting.      [Para 15]\n\nIn this case the execution of registered gift deed and its attestation by two witnesses is not in dispute. It has also been concurrently held by all the three courts below that the donee had accepted the gift. The recitals in the gift deed also prove transfer of absolute title in the gifted property from the donor to the donee. What is retained is only the right to use the property during the lifetime of the donor which does not in any way affect the transfer of ownership in favour of the donee by the donor.      [Para 19]"

The observations by the Delhi High Court, in Asha M. Jain v. Canara Bank - 94 (2001) DLT 841, that the \"concept of power of attorney sales have been recognized as a mode of transaction\" when dealing with transactions by way of SA/GPA/WILL are unwarranted and not justified, unintendedly misleading the general public into thinking that SA/GPA/WILL transactions are some kind of a recognized or accepted mode of transfer and that it can be a valid substitute for a sale deed. Such decisions to the extent they recognize or accept SA/GPA/WILL transactions as concluded transfers, as contrasted from an agreement to transfer, are not good law.\n\nWe therefore reiterate that immovable property can be legally and lawfully transferred/conveyed only by a registered deed of conveyance. Transactions of the nature of 'GPA sales' or 'SA/GPA/WILL transfers' do not convey title and do not amount to transfer, nor can they be recognized as valid mode of transfer of immoveable property. The courts will not treat such transactions as completed or concluded transfers or as conveyances as they neither convey title nor create any interest in an immovable property. They cannot be recognized as deeds of title, except to the limited extent of section 53A of the TP Act. Such transactions cannot be relied upon or made the basis for mutations in Municipal or Revenue Records. What is stated above will apply not only to deeds of conveyance in regard to freehold property but also to transfer of leasehold property. A lease can be validly transferred only under a registered Assignment of Lease. It is time that an end is put to the pernicious practice of SA/GPA/WILL transactions known as GPA sales.\n\n94 (2001) DLT 841 Held not good law.  [Para 15,16]\n\nSA/GPA/Will transactions can continue to be treated as existing agreement of sale. Nothing prevents affected parties from getting registered Deeds of Conveyance to complete their title. The said 'SA/GPA/WILL transactions' may also be used to obtain specific performance or to defend possession under section 53A of TP Act. If they are entered before this day, they may be relied upon to apply for regularization of allotments/leases by Development Authorities. If the documents relating to 'SA/GPA/WILL transactions' has been accepted acted upon by DDA or other developmental authorities or by the Municipal or revenue authorities to effect mutation, they need not be disturbed, merely on account of this decision.   [Para 18]\n\nThe observations regarding SA/GPA/Will transactions are not intended to apply to bona fide/genuine transactions.   [Para 19]"

Act.\n\nArticle 61 refers to right to redeem or recover possession. While right of mortgagor to redeem is dealt with under Section 60 of the T.P. Act, the right of usufructuary mortgagor to recover possession is specially dealt with under Section 62. Section 62 is applicable only to usufructuary mortgages and not to any other mortgage. The said right of usufructuary mortgagor though styled as 'right to recover possession' is for all purposes, right to redeem and to recover possession. Thus, while in case of any other mortgage, right to redeem is covered under Section 60, in case of usufructuary mortgage, right to recover possession is dealt with under Section 62 and commences on payment of mortgage money out of the usufructs or partly out of the usufructs and partly on payment or deposit by the mortgagor. This distinction in a usufructuary mortgage and any other mortgage is clearly borne out from provisions of Sections 58, 60 and 62 of the T.P. Act read with Article 61 of the Schedule to the Limitation Act. Usufructuary mortgage cannot be treated at par with any other mortgage, as doing so will defeat the scheme of Section 62 of the T.P. Act and the equity. This right of the usufructuary mortgagor is not only an equitable right, it has statutory recognition under Section 62 of the T.P. Act. There is no principle of law on which this right can be defeated. Any contrary view, which does not take into account the special right of usufructuary mortgagor under Section 62 of the T.P. Act, has to be held to be erroneous on this ground or has to be limited to a mortgage other than a usufructuary mortgage.\n\n1985 (4) SCC 162 Disting.\n\n2006(3) ALL MR 175 (S.C.), AIR 2012 (HP) 1 (FB) Overruled.

Sale how made - such transfer, in the case of tangible immoveable property of the value of one hundred rupees and upwards, or in the case of a reversion or other intangible thing, can be made only by a registered instrument.  In the case of tangible immoveable property of a value less than one hundred rupees, such transfer may be made either by a registered instrument or by delivery of the property.  Delivery of tangible immoveable property takes place when the seller places the buyer, or such person as he directs, in possession of the property.  Contract for sale - A contract for the sale of immoveable property is contract that a sale of such property shall take place on terms settled between the parties.  It does not, of itself, create any interest in or charge on such property. It is thus obvious that sale can be made only by a registered instrument.  The Article A Kararnama was not registered and, therefore,the same cannot be admitted in evidence even for collateral purpose, as per Section 49 of the Registration Act. Therefore, the appellant Court has obviously committed an apparent error of law by observing that this document can be admitted in evidence for collateral purposes.\t\t [Para 14,15]"

A legislation may classify the purpose of letting into several categories by adopting some other criterion just as the Bombay Act does (See, sub-section (1) of Section 6). In case of tenancy of type (a), for a composite or mixed purpose, the premises are let out for defined purposes, more than one, leaving the option open to the tenant to use the entire tenancy premises as one unit for either or both purposes. The tenancy premises are not divided or demarcated separately into two so as to specify which part of the tenancy premises will be used for what purpose. In other words, in case of tenancy for composite purpose, the two diverse purposes for user of the premises are so blended or mixed up that they cannot be separated by dissecting the tenancy premises into compartments. But, in case of tenancy of type (b), which is a single tenancy for dual purposes, .the contract of tenancy is no doubt an integrated one but the premises are demarcated or divided by reference to the purpose for which they will be separately used. The cases at hand are illustrations of the latter type, type (b), of an integrated contract of tenancy for dual purposes, where different portions are earmarked for different types of user. The contract of tenancy is one but it clearly sets out that out of the two rooms let out under one tenancy agreement, the tenant shall use the room in the front for non-residential purpose and the room in the backside for the purpose of residence. The entire tenancy premises cannot be used interchanging the users nor can the entire premises be subjected to simultaneous user as residence and commence - both, without defining which part of the premises shall be used for what purpose. Therefore, the purpose of letting, in the case at hand, falls under type (b) and is not composite or mixed. The legal implication is that in case of tenancy for composite or mixed purpose i.e. type (a) the need may arise for determining the dominant purpose of letting. However, the theory of dominant purpose or principle of predominant purpose of letting is irrelevant in the case of tenancies of type (b) when it is known, as previously agreed, that a particular portion of the premises shall be used for one purpose while another portion shall be used for another purpose.

The established rule of limitation is that law of limitation is not applicable to a plea taken in defence unless expressly a provision is made in the statute. The law of limitation applies to the suits and applications. The various articles of the Limitation Act show that they do not apply to a defence taken by a defendant In suit. Thus, the law of limitation bars only an action in a Court of law. In fact, what the Limitation Act does is, to take away the remedy of a plaintiff to enforce his rights by bringing an action in a Court of law, but it does not place any restriction to a defendant to put forward any defence though such defence as a claim made by him may be barred by limitation and cannot be enforced in a Court of law. On the said principle, a defendant in a suit can put forward any defence though such defence may not be enforceable in a Court of law, being barred by limitation.\t\t\t [Para 16]"

                ],
                "description": "Mortgage by conditional sale - Different from outright sale in payment of debt - In mortgage by conditional sale, right of ownership is transferred subject to condition that on default of payment, sale shall become absolute - In any form of mortgage, transfer is of \"some\" interest and not of \"whole\" interest of mortgagor - Mortgagor does not cease to be owner - Equity of redemption still vests in him which gets lost only upon a final decree of foreclosure or sale in favour of mortgagee - Till such final decree, mortgagor retains his right of redemption.\n\n\tIt is important to remember that mortgage is a transfer of interest in specific immovable property towards \"security for repayment of a debt\". The interest itself may be different in different forms of mortgage. In a simple mortgage, what is transferred is a power of sale, whilst in a usufructuary mortgage it is the right of the mortgagor to the enjoyment of the usufruct. In a mortgage by conditional sale or an English mortgage what is transferred is the right of ownership subject to a condition that on default of payment on a certain date the sale shall become absolute, or that on such payment being made the sale shall become void, or that on such payment being made the buyer shall transfer the property to the seller. Whatever be the form of mortgage, the transfer is of \"some\" interest only and not of the \"whole\" interest of the mortgagor. Unlike in the case of a sale in payment of a debt which extinguishes the debt, the debt always subsists in a mortgage. When a mortgagor mortgages his immovable property, he does not cease to be its owner; the equity of redemption still vests in him. This equity is lost unto him only when there is a final decree of foreclosure or sale in favour of mortgagee. This has always been our law and a mortgage by conditional sale is no exception to it.\t [Para 6]\n\n\tThe statutory provisions, which are reflected in Sections 58, 60 and 67 of the Transfer of Property Act and Order XXXIV of the Code of Civil Procedure make this position clear. \n\n\tClause (a) of Section 58 of the Transfer of Property Act defines a mortgage as \"transfer of an interest in specific immovable property for the purpose of securing the payment of money advanced or to be advanced by way of loan, an existing or future debt, or the performance of an engagement which may give rise to a pecuniary liability.\" Clause (c), deals with mortgage by conditional sale. It provides that where the mortgagor ostensibly sells the mortgaged property on a condition that on default of payment of the mortgage money on a certain date the sale shall become absolute, or on a condition that on such payment being made the sale shall become void, or on a condition that on such payment being made the buyer shall transfer the property to the seller, the transaction is called mortgage by conditional sale.\n\n\tSection 60 of the Transfer of Property Act provides for the mortgagor's right to redeem. At any time after the principal money has become due, the mortgagor has a right, on payment or tender of the mortgage money, at a proper time and place, to require the mortgagee to deliver to the mortgagor the mortgage deed and all documents relating to the mortgaged property which are in possession or power of the mortgagee and at the cost of the mortgagor either to retransfer the mortgaged property to him or to his nominee and to have registered an acknowledgement in writing that any right in derogation of his interest transferred to the mortgagee has been extinguished. Section 67 deals with the mortgagee's right to foreclosure or sale. In the absence of a contract to the contrary, the mortgagee has, at any time, after the mortgage money has become due to him and \"before a decree has been made for the redemption of the mortgaged property\" or before the mortgage money has been paid or deposited as provided in Section 67, a right to obtain from the court a decree that the mortgagor shall be absolutely debarred of his right to redeem the property or a decree that the property be sold. It is pertinent to note that the right to seek foreclosure is not available to any mortgagee other than a mortgagee by conditional sale or a mortgage under an anomalous mortgage by the terms of which he is entitled to foreclose. So also, the right to seek sale is not available to a usufructuary mortgagee or a mortgagee by conditional sale. What the scheme of this Section indicates is that the only remedy of a mortgagee by conditional sale is to apply for foreclosure and not for a decree of sale. Order XXXIV Rule 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure proceeds for a preliminary decree in a foreclosure suit. By this preliminary decree, the Court orders an account to be taken of what is due to the plaintiff on the date of such decree towards principal, interest, costs, etc. and declares the amounts so due at that date and directs that if the defendant pays into court the amounts so declared as due on or before such date as the court may fix within six months of the court confirming and countersigning the account, the plaintiff shall deliver up to the defendant, or to such person as the defendant may appoint, all documents relating to the mortgage of the property and retransfer, if so required, the property to the defendant at his cost free from the mortgage (subrule (1) of Rule 2). Rule 3 of Order XXXIV provides for a final decree in a foreclosure suit. The rule provides that if, before a final decree debarring the defendant from all the right to redeem the mortgage has been passed, the defendant makes payment into the court of all amounts due to him under subrule (1) of Rule 2, the court shall, on application made by the defendant, pass a final decree ordering the plaintiff to deliver up the documents referred to the preliminary decree and, if necessary, to retransfer the mortgaged property as directed in the decree. Only if such payment is not made by the defendant that the court shall, on the application of the plaintiff, pass a final decree declaring that the defendant and all persons claiming through or under him are debarred from all right to redeem the mortgaged property. This scheme makes it clear that at all events, and in case of all mortgages, where a foreclosure decree can be passed, the mortgagor retains his right of redemption until a final decree of foreclosure is passed. \t [Para 7]"

It was open to the donor to transfer by gift title and ownership in the property and at the same time reserve its possession and enjoyment to herself during her lifetime. There is no prohibition in law that ownership in property cannot be gifted without its possession and right of enjoyment. Under  Section 6 of the Transfer of Property Act \"property of any kind may be transferred\" except those mentioned in clauses (a) to (i). Clause (d) of Section 6 is not attracted on the terms of the gift deed  herein because it was not a property, the enjoyment of which was restricted to the owner personally. She was absolute owner  of the property gifted and it was not restricted in its enjoyment to herself. She had inherited it from her maternal father as a full owner. The High Court was, therefore, apparently wrong in coming to the conclusion that the gift deed was ineffectual merely because the donor had reserved to herself the possession and enjoyment of the property gifted.

How the intention is to be proved is a matter which would largely depend on the facts and circumstances of each case.  One has to take into account that the document in question is on the stamp paper purchased in the name of one Unique Land Developer; who is not party to the document, who has nothing to do with the transaction in question.  Had it been the genuine transaction, the stamp paper would have been purchased in the name of either of the parties.  The very fact that the old stamp paper lying with somebody, other than the persons involved in the transaction, has been used is one of the strong indicators to suggest that possibility of the document being ante-dated cannot be ruled out.\n\nThe mode, manner and tenor of the document including the contents thereof; strongly suggest that the draftsman of the document is not other than of a legal brain.  It cannot be assumed that the draftsman of the agreement had no knowledge about the drafting of such document and requirement of registration thereof but he must have been handicapped because of the necessity to create document in a previous date so as to show that the transaction has been done much prior to the date of attachment before judgment.  The document in question contains factually incorrect recitals with respect to non-borrowing of loan and non-creation of any charge on the suit property even though these facts were well within the knowledge of the licensor, the defendant No.3, the original owner of the flat, obviously, to show the transaction as genuine and prior to the date of attachment order.  Apart from this, the document contains recital showing payment of Rs.1,20,000/= in cash.  There is no material available on record from which account the cash was withdrawn by the plaintiff and how such payment of huge amount was made in cash.  There is also no material on record to show that how such cash was really received by defendant No.3 and that he invested the same in some security or used for making certain payments.  All these facts and circumstances, if seen in its proper perspective, it would be clear that the document in question is nothing but a fraudulent document brought in existence to defeat the claim of the creditor/ defendant No.2 bank.\t [Para 19,20]"

Civil P.C. (1908), S.100.\n\nIn the instant case, the Appellate Court has rightly placed reliance on the illustration (a) given below section 113 of the Transfer of Property Act.  That the illustration makes it clear that if the landlady accepts the rent before hand, the landlady has accepted the rent after issuance of quit notice to the defendants.  In addition to that, the rent was accepted for a period of 4 years since after issuance of the notice.  The suit for recovery of possession was instituted after a period of 6 years since issuance of the notice terminating the tenancy.  These facts themselves establish that the notices issued by the landlady stood waived by acceptance of the rent by the landlady.  That is a finding of fact.  It is very difficult to interfere with the findings in Second Appeal under Section 100 of the C.P.C.  The findings recorded by the Appellate Court is based on evidence on record.  That is a finding of fact.  Therefore, it is very difficult to accept the submission of Mr. Bhandarkar Advocate that the Appellate Court has committed an error in holding that there was waiver on account of the acceptance of rent after issuance of notice of termination.

The third Condition states that the tenant would have to pay the rent for the entire month even if the premises were vacated during the course of the month.

Even in respect of such a decree, the sale would be complete only upon the execution of the sale-deed in favour of the decree-holder either by the vendor/judgment-debtor or through the process of the Court. It is only upon the registration of such sale-deed upon payment of stamp duty under Item 20 of Schedule I of the Stamp Act, that any right, title and interest in such property shall validly pass on to the decree-holder, who is the purchaser of the suit property. Hence, mere passing a decree for specific performance of contract does not result in the transfer of property.  [Para 27,28]\n\nThus, the decree for specific performance of contract by itself, does not create right, title or interest in or charge on the immovable property in favour of a decree-holder. Hence, the provision of Section 17(1)(e) of Registration Act is not at all attracted. It cannot be said that a compromise decree is to be compulsorily registrable under the provisions of Section 17(2)(vi) of the Registration Act and by the same analogy a decree for specific performance of contract is also compulsorily registrable. The Executing Court has recorded the finding that H. was one of the plaintiffs and was having pre-existing right in the decree. Assuming this finding to be correct, the exemption under clause (vi) of Section 17(2) of the said Act would apply. Be that as it may, a decree for specific performance of contract, as has already been held, neither extinguishes right, title or interest in the immovable property, nor creates right, title or interest in immovable property and hence it is not compulsorily registrable under clauses (b) and (c) of Section 17(1) of the said Act. AIR 1996 SC 196 - Disting.  AIR 1941 Bombay 71 - Explained & Rel. on.  [Para 31,32,33]\n\nIt cannot also be said if the decree does not create any such right, title or interest in an immovable property, then it is the Deed at Exhibit 178, which creates right, title or interest in an immovable property in favour of the assignee and the same is, therefore, covered by Section 17(1)(b). If the decree itself does not create or purport to create any right, title or interest in or charge on the immovable property, then the question of conveying such right, title or interest in or charge on the immovable property by executing the deed of assignment, does not arise. Hence the provision of Section 17(1)(b) of the Registration Act is also not attracted.  [Para 34]"

The doctrine upon which this Section is based is that it would plainly be impossible that any action or suit could be brought to a successful termination if alienation pendente lite were permitted to prevail. The doctrine of lis-pendens is based upon expediency and not upon notice. Therefore, a transferee is affected though he may take the transfer without notice of the lis. Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, has over-riding effect. The impact of the doctrine of lis-pendens on the sale transaction is to make it subject to the decree or order to be passed in the suit. The transferee pendente lite is a representative of the transferor and is bound by the decree. Section 52 of the Transfer of Property Act, continues to be attracted even after the decree is passed and till the rights under decree are fully exercised. In view of this principle when a decree for permanent injunction has been obtained by the plaintiff - decree holder, in such circumstances, the decree holder or even his legal representatives can execute such decree against the transferee of the judgment debtor as the said transferee is bound by lis-pendens to obey such a decree because a purchaser from the defendant pendente lite is deemed to be a representative in interest of the defendant and, therefore, a representative within the meaning of the provisions of the C.P.C..

This principle is based on the doctrine of agency. One co-owner filing a suit for eviction against the tenant does so on his own behalf in his own right and as an agent of the other co-owners. The consent of other co-owners is assumed as taken unless it is shown that the other co-owners were not agreeable to eject the tenant and the suit was filed in spite of their disagreement. In the present case, the suit was filed by both the co-owners. One of the co-owners cannot withdraw his consent midway the suit so as to prejudice the other co-owner. The suit once filed, the rights of the parties stand crystallised on the date of the suit and the entitlement of the co-owners to seek ejectment must be adjudged by reference to the date of institution of the suit; the only exception being when by virtue of a subsequent event the entitlement of the body of co-owners to eject the tenant comes to an end by act of parties or by operation of law."

The property continues to remain of the ownership of the Applicant . The Applicant is seen to have derived the ownership from C.J.A. Castellino, presumably by inheritance (though the relationship between C.J.A. Castellino and himself is not specifically stated). There is no question of plot No.606 being co-owned by any other co-owner. It is an admitted position that the registered office of the Respondent is on plot No.606. The Applicant's son is one of the Directors. The Annual Reports show him to be a Director. The entire property is Garden Resort House. The rent receipts of Garden Resort are in respect of three shops and one office. It is not known which is the other part of Garden Resort House where the registered office of the Respondent is situate. The Applicant has not shown that Garden Resort House consists only of shop Nos.2, 3 4 and office. Hence, it would be inequitable to disallow the execution in respect of the part of Garden Resort House actually in possession of the Respondent as its registered office.\n\nOf course, neither the Applicant nor the Respondent would show the documentation with regard to the domicile of the Company. But the Claimant has produced copies of the Annual Reports statutorily required to be filed by the Respondent under Sections 159 to 163 of the Companies Act in which the particulars, inter alia, with regard to the registered office of the Company are given. The Advocate for the Claimant argued that the Company deals in huge maritime contracts. It is not expected to have only a table space. The Respondent-Company has shown the said address in all the correspondence and in the litigation with the Claimant. It would now be too late in the day to allow or reject the claim of the Claimant to the immovable property of the Company where its registered office is situate, specially in view of the fact that the only other claim is shown to be in favour of the sole proprietary Concern of the Applicant by virtue of the rent receipts produced by the Applicant which on and from the date of the Execution Application in effect show no creation or interest of any legal right, title and interest in favour of Garden Resort. 1985 Bom.R.C. 18 - Ref. to.

It provides that pendente lite, neither party to the litigation, in which any right to immovable property is in question, can alienate or otherwise deal with such property so as to affect his appointment (sic). This Section is based on equity and good conscience and is intended to protect the parties to litigation against alienations by their opponent during the pendency of the suit. In order to constitute a lis pendens, the following elements must be present:\n\n1.\tThere must be a suit or proceeding pending in a Court of competent jurisdiction.\n\n2.\tThe suit or proceeding must not be collusive.\n\n3.\tThe litigation must be one in which right to immovable property is directly and specifically in question.\n\n4.\tThere must be a transfer of or otherwise dealing with the property in dispute by any party to the litigation.\n\n5.\tSuch transfer must affect the rights of the other party that may ultimately accrue under the terms of the decree or order.\n\nThe doctrine of lis pendens applies only where the lis is pending before a Court. Further pending the suit, the transferee is not entitled as of right to be made a party to the suit, though the Court has a discretion to make him a party. But the transferee pendente lite can be added as a proper party if his interest in the subject-matter of the suit is substantial and not just peripheral. A transferee pendente lite to the extent he has acquired interest from the defendant is vitally interested in the litigation, whether the transfer is of the entire interest of the defendant, the latter having no more interest in the property may not properly defend the suit. He may collude with the plaintiff. Hence, though the plaintiff is under no obligation to make a lis pendens transferee a party; under Order XXII, Rule 10 an alienee pendente lite may be joined as party. As already noticed, the Court has discretion in the matter which must be judicially exercised and an alienee would ordinarily be joined as a party to enable him to protect his interests. The Court has held that a transferee pendente lite of an interest in immovable property is a representative-in-interest of the party from whom he has acquired that interest. He is entitled to be impleaded in the suit or other proceedings where the transferee pendente lite is made a party to the litigation; he is entitled to be heard in the matter on the merits of the case."

                "description": "Lessor and lessee - Rights and liabilities of - Lessee acquiring rights of certain co-owner landlords - His position as tenant continues and he cannot successfully raise plea of determination of tenancy on ground of merger of his estate in that of the landlord - He is, therefore, bound to comply with requirements of Rent Control Act.\n\nIn this case, the lessee has acquired only the rights of certain co-owner landlords and may have the right to work out his rights against the others. The right to work out his rights would not enable him to plead that the two rights in the whole of the property has come to vest in him. What is involved in the present case is the question whether on the acquisition of the rights of some of the co-owner landlords by the tenant, there is an extinguishment of the tenancy by merger as postulated by Section 111 (d) of the Transfer of Property Act. A plain and grammatical interpretation of Section 111(d) of the Transfer of Property Act leaves no room for doubt that unless the interests of the lessee and that of the lessor in the whole of the property leased, become vested at the same time in one person in the same right, a determination of the lease cannot take place. On taking an assignment from some of the co-owner landlords, the interests of the lessee and the lessor in the whole of the property do not become vested at the same time in one person in the same right. Therefore, a lessee who has taken assignment of the rights of a co-owner lessor, cannot successfully raise the plea of determination of tenancy on the ground of merger of his lessee's estate in that of the estate of the landlord. It is, thus, clear that there is no substance in the contention that in the case on hand, it should have been held that the tenancy stood determined and the application of the landlord for a direction to the tenant to deposit the rent in arrears should have been dismissed. The position of the appellants as tenants continue and they are bound to comply with the requirements of the Rent Control Act under which the order for deposit has been passed against them.

Registration Act (1908), S.49. Civil P.C. (1908), S.100.\n\nIn case of sale, the person, inducted into possession of property, under an agreement, can insist that he is entitled to remain in possession of the property, to the complete exclusion of the transferor, provided he expresses his readiness and willingness to perform his part of the contract, and thereby, avail the benefit of Section 53-A. However, a person in possession of immovable property, under an agreement of lease, cannot insist that he is not liable to be evicted at all, by taking recourse to the plea of Section 53-A. On the extension of such benefit, the maximum that can happen is that, the transaction of lease, which hitherto was incomplete, can be brought about. Even where a lease in accordance with Section 107 of the Act emerges through specific performance, the obligation of the lessee to be evicted, does not cease. It is no doubt true, that the circumstances, under which a lessee can be evicted, would differ, from case to case, depending on the terms of lease. If no definite period of lease is stipulated, Section 106 can be pressed into service by the lessor, and if the lease is for a specific period, Section 111 of the Act would govern the field.\t [Para 25]\n\nThe terms of a lease can be those contained in the lease deed, or the general terms prescribed under Chapter V of the Transfer of Property Act. Even if Exs.B-12 and B-13 are to be treated as agreements of lease, they can be looked into only for collateral purposes in a transaction of lease. Except possession, no other purpose can be treated as collateral to the transaction of a lease. The other terms, such as duration of lease, mutual obligation as to renewal, fixation, or enhancement of rent etc., cannot be treated as collateral. Such terms can be contained only in a lease deed, which accords with Section 107. If for any reason, all the terms and conditions contained in Exs.B- 12 and B-13 can be looked into, notwithstanding the fact that the deeds are not registered, it becomes equally permissible for the plaintiffs to rely upon Clause (10), of Ex.B-12, which provided for premature eviction. Therefore, it has to be held that :  \n\n(a) Exs.B-12 and B-13 did not bring about any lease, as provided for under the Act; and \n\n(b) that the defendants cannot resist their eviction by taking the plea under Section 53-A of the Act.  [Para 26,27]\n\nThe plaintiffs would be entitled for a decree for eviction of the defendants, but as a condition precedent, the value of the building must be assessed by appointing a Chartered Engineer, and so assessed, must be paid. The cost of the building, the plaintiffs are entitled for a decree, for the rents up to the date of filing of the suit, and for subsequent period, it    shall be open to them to file an application for appointment of a Commissioner, for ascertainment of the same. Since the plaintiffs are running an Educational Institution, they deserve to be granted reasonable time.  [Para 33]"

In a sale coupled with an agreement to recovery, there is no relationship of debtor and creditor nor price is charged on the property conveyed but the sale is subject to an obligation to transfer the property within the period specified.  What distinguishes the two transactions is the relationship of debtor and creditor and the transfer being a security for the debt.  The document needs to be construed on touch stone of Section 58(c) of the Transfer of Property Act.  The document shows that about 12 months prior i.e. somewhere in September/October, 1962 an amount of Rs.275/- was obtained by the plaintiff from the defendant in order to purchase a sewing machine.  He further obtained Rs.125/- at the time of the execution of the document by way of hand loan.  Needless to say the terms of the document do not show that both these amounts were treated as payment towards consideration of the suit land.  The document itself does not show the agreed price of the suit land.  The terms of the document do not show that prior to the execution of document in question, there was an agreement to alienate the suit land under certain terms.  The terms of the document also do not show that immediately the ownership of the suit land was transferred and the defendant was allowed to enjoy the property as owner.  The mere fact that he was supposed to pay the land revenue is of no avail.  He was placed into possession of the suit land and was to enjoy the usufruct.  Obviously, he was required to pay the land revenue as a person in possession of the suit land.  AIR 1992 SC 1236 and 2006(1) Mh.L.J. 867 - Ref. to.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 10]"

Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act has nothing to do with the ownership of the transferor who remains full owner of the suit property till it is legally conveyed by executing a registered sale deed in favour of the transferee.  Such was not the case here.  The defendants had claimed to be the owners of the suit property in pursuance of the registered sale deed which was executed in the year 1983.  Hence Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act did not come into play as under Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act, a proposed transferee is entitled to protect his possession against the true owner or any person claiming through him.  It cannot apply in the case where the person who is put in possession of the suit property is not the proposed transferee, but is, in fact, a person who claims that the property is already transferred in his favour.  In the absence of any pleadings in the written statement and in view of the fact that the plaintiff did not have an opportunity to prove that he was the bona fide purchaser for value without notice, the provisions of Section 53-A of the Transfer of Property Act cannot be invoked at least to protect the possession of the defendants, especially when the defendants are not the proposed transferees but claim title in themselves.  2004(5) ALL MR (S.C.) 1189 and AIR 2001 SC 1658 - Distinguished.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t     [Para 8]"

The Transfer of Property Act does not prescribe any particular mode of acceptance. It is the circumstances attending to the transaction which may be relevant for determining the question. There may be various means to prove acceptance of a gift. The document may be handed over to a donee, which in a given situation may also amount to a valid acceptance. The fact that possession had been given to the donee also raises a presumption of acceptance. \t\t\t  [Para 14]"

The effect of Section 52 is not to render transfers effected during the pendency of a suit by a party to the suit void; but only to render such transfers subservient to the rights of the parties to such suit, as may be, eventually, determined in the suit. In other words, the transfer remains valid subject, to the result of the suit.

                "description": "Co-operative housing society - Bye-laws stipulating that property can be transferred back only to society or with prior permission to a person qualified to be a member of society - Such a bye-law is not in absolute restraint on alienation offending S.10 of T.P. Act.\n\nSection 10 of the Transfer of Property Act relieves a transferee of immoveable property from an absolute restraint placed on his right to deal with the property in his capacity as an owner thereof. As per Section 10, a condition restraining alienation would be void. The Section applies to a case where property is transferred subject to a condition or limitation absolutely restraining the transferee from parting with his interest in the property. For making such a condition invalid, the restraint must be an absolute restraint. It must be a restraint imposed while the property is being transferred to the transferee. Here, respondent No.2 became a member of the Society on the death of his father. He subscribed to the bye-laws. He accepted Section 30 of the Act and the other restrictions placed on a member. Respondent No.2 was qualified to be a member in terms of the bye-laws. His father was also a member of the Society. The allotment of the property was made to appellant in his capacity as a member. There was really no transfer of property to respondent No.2. He inherited it with the limitations thereon placed by Section 31 of the Act and the bye-laws. His right to become a member depended on his possessing the qualification to become one as per the bye-laws of the Society. He possessed that qualification. The bye-laws provide that he should have the prior consent of the Society for transferring the property or his membership to a person qualified to be a member of the Society. These are restrictions in the interests of the Society and its members and consistent with the object with which the Society was formed. He cannot question that restriction. It is also not possible to say that such a restriction amounts to an absolute restraint on alienation within the meaning of Section 10 of the Transfer of Property Act. The restriction, if any, is a self-imposed restriction. It is a restriction in a contract to which the father of respondent No.2 was a party and to which respondent No.2 voluntarily became a party. It is difficult to postulate that such a qualified freedom to transfer a property accepted by a person voluntarily, would attract Section 10 of the Act. Moreover, it is not as if it is an absolute restraint on alienation. Respondent No.2 has the right to transfer the property to a person who is qualified to be a member of the Society as per its bye-laws. At best, it is a partial restraint on alienation. Such partial restraints are valid if imposed in a family settlement, partition or compromise of disputed claims. So, when a person accepts membership in a co-operative society by submitting himself to its bye-laws and secures an allotment of a plot of land or a building in terms of the bye-laws and places on himself a qualified restriction in his right to transfer the property by stipulating that the same would be transferred back to the society or with the prior consent of the society to a person qualified to be a member of the society, it cannot be held to be an absolute restraint on alienation offending Section 10 of the Transfer of Property Act. He has placed that restriction on himself in the interest of the collective body, the society. He has voluntarily submerged his rights in that of the society.   [Para 35,36]\n\nThe fact that the rights of a member or an allottee over a building or plot is attachable and saleable in enforcement of a decree or an obligation against him cannot make a provision like the one found in the bye-laws, an absolute restraint on alienation to attract Section 10 of the Transfer of Property Act. Of course, it is property in the hands of the member on the strength of the allotment. It may also be attachable and saleable in spite of the volition of the allottee. But that does not enable the Court to hold that the condition that an allotment to the member is subject to his possessing the qualification to be a member of the co-operative society or that a voluntary transfer by him could be made only to the society itself or to another person qualified to be a member of the society and with the consent of the society could straightway be declared to be an absolute restraint on alienation and consequently an interference with his right to property protected by Article 300-A of the Constitution of India.

But the question of directing accounts would arise only where it is necessary to find out what is due from the mortgagor to the mortgagee, or whether there is any over payment by the mortgagor to the mortgagee. In this case, the mortgage was an usufructuary mortgage, where the mortgagee was entitled to retain possession until the mortgage money was paid. When the mortgage debt got statutorily discharged, the mortgagee became liable to deliver back possession to the mortgagor. In such a situation, what the mortgagors-plaintiffs can claim from the mortgagee, is not rendition of accounts, but mesne profits for wrongful possession from the date of discharge of the mortgage debt. There is, therefore, no question of accounting either of the amounts due by the mortgagor to the mortgagee or of any accounting of over-payments or for refund of any over-payments by the mortgagee. In the suit, plaintiffs only sought rendition of accounts but did not claim mesne profits nor paid any court fee in regard to past mesne profits. Plaintiffs cannot, under the guise of a claim for accounts, seek a decree for mesne profits. After obtaining possession, it is open to them to sue for such mesne profits as is permissible in law.

It cannot be unilateral.  The landlord must come to know that the tenant has given-up the possession and the rights, at least, in an express surrender.  There is no pleading whether the surrender was express or implied.  Since there is no pleading as to whether the surrender was express or implied, the defendants were debarred from tendering any evidence to prove either.  Clause (e) of Section 111 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 speaks of express surrender while (f) speaks of implied.  This question, therefore, will be a mixed question of facts and law.  It was for this reason that a clear pleading as to the nature of surrender was necessary.  That having been left vague, no amount of evidence is admissible.\n\nWhen a lessee accepts new lease during continuance of the old, there is implied surrender of the original lease.  It is not even pleaded by the defendants that any other new relationship, such as mortgagor - mortgagee, licensor - licensee came into existence or there was any new contract of lease.  What is alleged is that the plaintiffs have vacated the premises and have gone to live elsewhere.  This does not and cannot amount to implied surrender at all.  Since there is no pleading of coming into existence of new relationship or new contract of lease, the case does not at all fall under clause (f) of S.111 of the Transfer of Property Act.  Although the courts below have not considered the case in this perspective, their finding that there was no implied surrender was factually correct.\t [Para 10]"

                "description": "Lease - Transfer of interest - Lease is a transfer of interest in the property - Monthly lease which means a lease for a month renewable every month, would also be a transfer of interest in the property.\n\nSection 105 of the Transfer of Property Act 1882, defines the lease of an immovable property as a transfer of a right to enjoy such property, made for a certain time, express or implied, or in perpetuity, in consideration of a price paid or promised, or of money, a share of crops, service or any other thing of value, to be rendered periodically or on specified occasions to the transferor by the transferee, who accepts the transfer on such terms. Lease undoubtedly is a transfer of interest in the property and so a monthly lease which means a lease for a month renewable every month, would also be a transfer in the interest in the property, that is transfer of a right to use the property for the unexpired period of the lease for a month. Clause (j) of section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 provides that a lessee may transfer absolutely or by way of a mortgage or sub lease the whole or any part of his interest in the property, and any transferee of such interest or part may again transfer it. Section 108(j) of the Transfer of Property Act thus recognizes the right of a lessee to transfer his leasehold interest in the property. Such transfer may be absolute, that is by way of an assignment or may be limited, that is, by way of a mortgage or sub lease. Ofcourse, section 108 of the Transfer of Property Act is subject to the contract to the contrary. The lessor and the lessee may, by an agreement, agree that the lessee shall not transfer his right either absolutely or even partially. But unless there is a contract between the lessor and the lessee prohibiting transfer a lessee is entitled to transfer his leasehold interest (including an interest as a monthly tenant) either absolutely or partially unless the contract between the parties prohibits such transfer. The legislature of Maharashtra, however, by enacting the Bombay Rent Act imposed a restriction on the right of a lessee to transfer his leasehold interest.  [Para 8]"

As per the Contract Act, 1872, it is clearly stated that for an agreement to become a contract, the parties must be competent to contract, wherein age of majority is a condition for competency. A deed of mortgage is a contract and we cannot hold that a mortgage in the name of a minor is valid, simply because it is in the interests of the minor unless she is represented by her natural guardian or guardian appointed by the court. The law cannot be read differently for a minor who is a mortgagor and a minor who is a mortgagee as there are rights and liabilities in respect of the immovable property would flow out of such a contract on both of them. Therefore, the mortgage deed is void ab initio in law and the appellant cannot claim any rights under it.   [Para 9,10]"

Only to the aforesaid limited context a \"right to sell\" is something which is similar, if not higher, to a \"right to lease\" an immovable property. It is well-settled position of law that an \"agreement to sell\" does not create any legal interest in the immovable property. Though an agreement to sell is enforceable in law, such an agreement does not by itself create any right, title or interest in the immovable property. Certainly, an \"agreement to sell\" creates rights which are similar (if not higher) in nature as are created by an \"agreement to lease\". Therefore, if an agreement to sell does not create any right in an immovable property, obviously, an agreement to lease also does not create any right in an immovable property.  [Para 98,99]"

If during the pendency of any suit in a court of competent jurisdiction which is not collusive, in which any right of an immovable property is directly and specifically in question, such property cannot be transferred by any party to the suit so as to affect the rights of any other party to the suit under any decree that may be made in such suit. If ultimately the title of the pendente lite transferor is upheld in regard to the transferred property, the transferee's title will not be affected. On the other hand, if the title of the pendente lite transferor is recognized or accepted only in regard to a part of the transferred property, then the transferee's title will be saved only in regard to that extent and the transfer in regard to the remaining portion of the transferred property to which the transferor is found not entitled, will be invalid and the transferee will not get any right, title or interest in that portion. If the property transferred pendente lite, is allotted in entirety to some other party or parties or if the transferor is held to have no right or title in that property, the transferee will not have any title to the property. Where a co-owner alienates a property or a portion of a property representing to be the absolute owner, equities can no doubt be adjusted while making the division during the final decree proceedings, if feasible and practical (that is without causing loss or hardship or inconvenience to other parties) by allotting the property or portion of the property transferred pendente lite, to the share of the transferor, so that the bonafide transferee's right and title are saved fully or partially.   [Para 10]\n\nIn this case, a suit for partition filed by the first respondent against the second respondent in the year 1985 which included the suit property, was pending in a court of competent jurisdiction as on the date of sale (11.4.1990) by the second respondent in favour of the appellant. The partition suit was not collusive. Having regard to Section 52 of the Act, the sale by the second respondent in favour of the appellant did not in any way affect the right of the first respondent (plaintiff in the partition suit) or the decree made in her favour in the said partition suit. It is thus evident that the sale by second respondent in favour of the appellant though not void, did not bind the first respondent who was the plaintiff in the partition suit. On the other hand, the sale in favour of appellant was subject to the right declared or recognized in favour of the first respondent-plaintiff under the decree passed in the pending partition suit. The sale pendente lite would therefore be subject to the decree in the partition suit.   [Para 11]"

If the argument advanced on behalf of the respondents is taken to its logical conclusion, this lease can never be terminated, save in cases of breach by the tenant. Accepting this argument would mean that in a situation where the tenant does not default on rent payment for three consecutive months, or does not commit a breach of the terms of the lease, it is not open to the lessor to terminate the lease even after giving a notice. This interpretation of the clause 6 of the agreement cannot be permitted as the same is wholly contrary to the express provisions of the law.

The scheme of this part of the provision would come into effect only if there is no contract between the lessor and the lessee in respect of immovable property for agricultural or manufacturing purpose.  The contingency contemplated in this part of the provision takes effect only in absence of a contract for this purpose and not otherwise.  The intent of the provision is apparent that in absence of such contract and if the lease pertains to immovable property, which is for manufacturing purpose, deeming fiction is created and by virtue of such deeming fiction, such lease will be deemed to be a lease from year to year basis, and not otherwise.  In order to get the protection of the deeming provision, the requisite contingency is absence of contract.  It is, no doubt, true that the purpose for which the tenancy is created has a bearing in determining the nature of lease.  However, that would be available only in absence of the contract.  It will be difficult to hold that merely because the duration is more than one year and the lease is created for manufacturing purpose, one can jump to the conclusion that the same is from year to year without considering the other stipulations in such agreement.  Under the scheme of Section 106, such interpretation is permissible only in absence of the contract.  In the instant case the stipulations in deed of lease in no uncertain terms demonstrate that the intention of the parties was to create monthly tenancy though the period of lease was more than one year.  However, the tenancy was from month to month.  [Para 15,16,17]\n\nThere is no prohibition in law, factual or otherwise, for creation of lease for a period more than one year and by agreement of parties the rent may be payable every month.  Such document of contract of lease is perfectly sustainable in law.  The intention of the parties to the lease, whether to treat such lease to be a lease for year to year or month to month is required to be ascertained from the stipulation in such Agreement of Lease.  The contingency, which is contemplated in the first half of the portion of provisions of Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act operates or comes into effect only in absence of a contract written or oral and not otherwise.  When there is a document of lease, all the aspects such as duration of lease, nature of lease, i.e., monthly or yearly, would be regulated totally by the stipulations in such document of lease, which demonstrates intention of the parties to the lease and in such situation, provisions of first part of Section 106 of the Transfer of Property Act cannot be said to be applicable.

The way parties choose to describe it is not always determinative of its nature. Exclusive possession of the premises is not the conclusive test.  Though it is an important circumstance in certain cases, other circumstance may disprove the existence of lease.  There is no simple litmus test to distinguish agreement of lease from that of leave and licence.  The intention has to be gathered from the terms of the agreement except where it is proved that the document is a camouflage.  If it is alleged that the document is a camouflage, the mask or veil is required to be removed for determining the true intent and purpose of the document.  If the terms of the document are not clear, the surrounding circumstances and the conduct of the parties have also to be borne in mind for ascertaining the real relationship between the parties.

The execution of a separate agreement for reconveyance, either contemp or aneously or subsequently, shall militate against the agreement being mortgage by conditional sale. There must exist a debtor and creditor relationship. The valuation of the property, and the transaction value, along with the duration of time for reconveyance, are important considerations to decide the nature of the agreement. There will have to be a cumulative consideration of these factors, along with the recitals in the agreement, intention of the parties, coupled with other attendant circumstances, considered in a holistic manner. \t [Para 14]"

Following six circumstances can be taken as a guide to determine the nature of the transaction:\n\n\"1. the source from which the purchase money came;\n\n2.  the nature and possession of the property, after the purchase;\n\n3. motive, if any, for giving the transaction a benami colour;\n\n4. the position of the parties and the relationship, if any, between the claimant and the alleged benamidar;\n\n5. the custody of the title deeds after the sale; and\n\n6. the conduct of the parties concerned in dealing with the property after the sale.\"\n\nThe above indicia are not exhaustive and their efficacy varies according to the facts of each case. Nevertheless, the source from where the purchase money came and the motive why the property was purchased benami are by far the most important tests for determining whether the sale standing in the name of one person, is in reality for the benefit of another. \t\t\t\t\t\t  [Para 13,14]"

The essentials of an agreement, to qualify as a mortgage by conditional sale, can succinctly be summarised. An ostensible sale with transfer of possession and ownership, but containing a clause for reconveyance in accordance with Section 58(c) of the Act, will clothe the agreement as a mortgage by conditional sale. The execution of a separate agreement for reconveyance, either contemporaneously or subsequently, shall militate against the agreement being mortgage by conditional sale. There must exist a debtor and creditor relationship. The valuation of the property, and the transaction value, along with the duration of time for reconveyance, are important considerations to decide the nature of the agreement. There will have to be a cumulative consideration of these factors, along with the recitals in the agreement, intention of the parties, coupled with other attendant circumstances, considered in a holistic manner. The language used in the agreement may not always be conclusive.\t [Para 10]"

On the basis of this application, Society has acted upon and then recorded change in the share certificate which now mentions only the name of the applicant. The applicant has accepted that position. The act of relinquishment was in relation to the interest in the immovable property though that occurs due to the transfer of shares. In other words, the applicant has accepted the transfer of interest in the immovable property effected by way of relinquishment by the co-owners. If it is so, it would fall within the definition of Gift of immovable property within the section 122 of Transfer of Property Act. Indeed, expression relinquishment is not defined in the Transfer of Property Act but dictionary meaning thereof is abandonment of right or abatement of right. The concomitant of abandonment or relinquishment of right of one devolves that corresponding right in favour of the other which has the effect of transfer by way of gift within the expansive definition under section 122 of the Transfer of Property Act. Such gift has to be registered so that in law transfer will take effect. (1998)9 SCC 194 and 1990(3) Bom.C.R. 389 - Referred to.  [Para 5]"
