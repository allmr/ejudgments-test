The order of the Appellate Authority would also show that the application under Order 41, Rule 27 of the Code was rejected on the same date but by a separate order, which was not within the knowledge of the appellant at the time the notice was issued by the High Court entertaining the revisional application. Even assuming that the fact of such rejection was not brought to the notice of the High Court, it could not lead to rejection of the civil revision case within deciding the same on merits. Therefore, the order of High Court rejecting the civil revision case without going into the merits as to whether the respondent was entitled to an order of eviction on the ground that she required the suit premises for her own use and occupation would be improper.

It is not correct to say that the Board cannot charge anything beyond what is mentioned in clause VI of the Schedule to Electricity Act, 1910.

If the project cost is one of the particulars required to be given by an applicant, while making an application under sub-section (1) of Section 44, then in the event, Board gives the consent and while acting in pursuance of that consent, the project cost varies, then for such variation, further consent of the Board would be necessary, as provided under sub-section (2) of Section 44. Since the Board could withhold the consent, if it shows to the applicant that the electricity required by him could be more economically obtained within a reasonable time from another appropriate source, to arrive at such conclusion, it would be reasonable to infer that the applicant must indicate the project cost in its application for consent. If the project cost is not indicated in the application for consent, then the Board will not be in a position to find out whether the electricity required by the applicant could be more economically obtained from another appropriate source within a reasonable time and, therefore, it is necessary for every applicant while invoking power of the Board under sub-section (1) of Section 44 to obtain the previous consent in writing for establishment of a generating station to indicate the cost of the project. This being the position, where consent is received on the basis of the project cost indicated in the application, while acting in pursuance of such consent, if the project cost varies, then it would be a material variation of an important particular and consequently, a further consent of the Board would be necessary under sub-section (2) of Section 44. In the case in hand, the original consent of the Board had been obtained and while acting in pursuance of such consent, it was found that the project cost has got escalated and application for further consent was made to the Board and the Board also did accord its further consent at Rs. 1853 crores, which was communicated to the applicant-licensee. While the applicant-licensee had indicated the revised project cost at a much higher figure but the Board approved the revised cost at Rs. 1853 crores and this further consent on the basis of revised cost can only be under sub-section (2) of Section 44 and in fact the Board also communicated the same in the purported exercise of power under sub-section (2) of Section 44. The further consent in respect of the revised project cost having been given under sub-section (2) of Section 44, a dispute did arise within the ambit of sub-section (3) of Section 44 and, therefore, the authority concerned contemplated under sub-section (3) of Section 44, gets jurisdiction to arbitrate upon the dispute between the parties and in the case in hand, the said authority ultimately passed an award.

There was absolutely no necessity in re-stating in the notification that the Board shall have all the powers which the Telegraph Authority possesses under the Indian Telegraph Act for placing of any wires, poles, wall-brackets, stays, apparatus and appliances for the transmission and distribution of electricity when the notification states that the Board shall exercise all the powers of Telegraph Authority vested in it as provided under section 42 of the said Act. The notification, therefore, clearly empowers the Board, its officers, servants and agents to exercise all the powers of Telegraph Authority under the Indian Telegraph Act for execution of the scheme which has been sanctioned and, therefore, the provisions of sections 12 to 19 of the Indian Electricity Act would not apply. The Courts below, therefore, seriously erred in holding that in the notification published under section 28(3), the Board has not been empowered with the powers of Telegraph Authority under the Indian Telegraph Act and that the provisions of sections 12 to 19 of the Indian Electricity Act were required to be followed.  [Para 11]\n\nThere can be no doubt that laying of electric supply lines is of utmost importance, need of hour and life and blood of progress and development and the said process cannot be allowed to be blocked on technical grounds. In the present case, the notification dated 30-10-1986 means that the Board exercises the powers of Telegraph Authority in execution of the scheme, and, therefore, there is no impediment for the Board and its officials to exercise the powers of the Telegraph Authority possessed under Part III of Indian Telegraph Act and do all such acts necessary for execution of the Scheme.

Maxims - Generalis specialibus non derogant.\n\nThe circular issued by the Electricity Board dt:23-5-2001 relating to transfer of its employees is valid. The circular is not introducing the subject of transfer as a new subject.  What is being done by the circular is certain guidelines are being issued while exercising the powers of transfer and suggesting under what circumstances and situations the transfer would be effected.  If any particular employee is thereby hurt, he has his every remedy open to challenge the same on any special grounds such as malafide etc.  However, it would be incorrect to suggest that by issuing the circular the respondent/Board is in any manner tampering with the items enumerated in the schedule under Section 2-A of 1946 Act.   [Para 24]\n\nThough the Regulations made under Section 79(c) of the Electricity (Supply) Act are statutory in nature, however that could not mean that the same would stand on a high pedestal so as to override the Standing Orders made under the Standing Orders Act.  No doubt, the Statutory bodies are authorities within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution and the employees of these bodies have a  statutory status, it is also no doubt true that the Regulations made under the statutes creating these bodies have force of law, however, that by itself would not be sufficient to hold that the regulations framed under Section 79(c) have to gather more importance than that of the provisions made under the Standing Orders Act which is a special law.   [Para 21]\n\nThe Model Standing Orders are definitely applicable to the employees in the service of the respondent/Board.  Failure on the part of the Board to frame Standing Orders and to get the same certified or duly notified, would not allow the respondent-Board to contend that provisions in respect of subject to which reference is made in the Schedule under Section 2-A of the Act of 1946, would not apply. In this view of the matter it can be said that the provisions of the special Act will prevail in the matter and, therefore, the Board has to comply with the provisions of the Act of 1946.   [Para 23]\n\nIf any industry has to make any provisions about any of the subjects in the Standing Orders, if the Standing Orders are framed or if it is to be tampered with in any manner, what is required is, those regulations are to be got notified either in accordance with Section 13-B if the industry is a government undertaking or it has to be got duly certified by Certifying Officer under Section 5 of 1946 Act. But, when the subject about which a regulation is already framed by the Board or when that particular subject does not form part or is not included in any of the items given in schedule under Section 2-A of the Act then in why it should not be permissible for the Board to issue certain guidelines in respect of the subject which is already included in the regulation is a question.  Restriction is only with regard to the subjects which are included in the schedule and not the subjects which are outside the schedule.  In the matter in hand, the matters which are enumerated in the Standing Orders in respect of those matters only the Act of 1946 will have to be treated as a special Act but the matters not enumerated therein in the cases of those matters, the regulations framed by the Board under Section 79(c) will have to prevail.

Regulation 15(e) has a reasonable nexus with the object sought to be achieved, that is to save public property so as to subserve the general interest of the community. Once electricity is disconnected and the equipment dismantled, it is unjust to compel the Board to give electricity connection to the very same premises at the instance of a third party which will not be in public interest especially when electricity is considered as a public property.

Merely stating that the statement of an officer is being utilized for the purpose of adjudication would not be sufficient in all cases. If an application is made requesting for grant of an opportunity to cross examine any official, the same has to be considered by the adjudicating authority who shall have to either grant the request or pass a reasoned order if he chooses to reject the application. In that event an adjudication being concluded, it shall be certainly open to the consumer to establish before the appellate authority as to how he has been prejudiced by the refusal to grant opportunity to cross-examine any official. As has been rightly noted by the High Court in the impugned judgment where the reliance is only on accounts prepared by a person, cross-examination is not necessary. But where it is based on reports alleging tampering or pilferage, the fact situation may be different. Before asking for cross examination the consumer may be granted an opportunity to look into the documents on which the adjudication is proposed. In that event, he will be in a position to know as to the author of which statement is necessary to be cross-examined. The applications for cross-examination are not to be filed in routine manner and equally also not to be disposed of by adjudicator in casual or routine manner. There has to be application of mind by him. Similarly, as noted above, the consumer has to show as to why cross examination is necessary.   [Para 9]\n\nIt cannot be laid down as a rule of universal application that whenever the statement of officer is pressed into service for the purpose of adjudication, a right of cross-examination is in-built."

Similarly, in a case where connected load is more than the sanctioned load, the assessment charge has to be done on the basis of a formula where 'C' stands for six months or the number of months or part thereof elapsed from the date of connection/installation, whichever is less. Therefore under the Tariff in both the cases the period can be taken as 180 days or six months. It is on the basis of this formula that the assessment for consumption of units has been done for 180 days. This being the legal position, the Electricity Board in our opinion rightly applied Clause 16.9 of the Tariff and there is no infirmity in the assessment made and the bill prepared in pursuance thereof.

When a beneficent scheme is made by State, promissory estoppel would undoubtedly apply.  A question as to whether, in a given situation, an entrepreneur was entitled to benefit under exemption notification or not would depend upon facts of each case.  A bare perusal of exemption notification shows that purport and object thereof was to grant benefit of a conessional power tariff.  Phraseology used in the notification postulates that benefit was to be granted in regard to 'enhanced power tariff'.  Thus, where new units had started production between 1-1-1992 and 31-12-1992, such exemption was available to entrepreneurs.  Evidently, except in a situation that any application filed by entrepreneur had not been processed within a reasonable time, in which case benefit might not be denied on equitable ground; in cases where there has been a substantial failure on part of industrial unit to obtain such benefit owing to acts of omission and commission on its part, no such benefit can be given.  High Court arriving at a finding of fact that appellant had failed and/or neglected to comply with terms and conditions of scheme or contributed to a large extent in not being able to obtain such sanction within a reasonable time.  While granting relief in a writ pettion, High Court is entitled to consider fact situation obtaining in each case including conduct of petitioner.  If it is found that appellant approached Court after a long delay, same may disentitle him to obtain a discretionary relief.  Supreme Court was of opinion that principle of promissory estoppel will apply where an entrepreneur has altered its position pursuant to a promise made by State, but application thereof would depend upon facts and circumstances of each case.  Having regard to findings of fact arrived at by High Court, Supreme Court was of opinion that it cannot be said to have committed any illegality in passing impugned judgment.\t\t\t\t\t        [Para 15,17,28,34,39,41]"

It is relevant to notice that the new industrial units, which were being established in the hill areas, could not have compelled the Government to exercise power under Section 49 of the Act of 1948 in their favour, for grant of rebate/concession in electricity tariff.  Powers under Section 49 normally would be exercised by the State Government for industrial growth of an area and to generate employment opportunities for those who are residing in the area.  However, on change in the circumstances, the Government can always reconsider the matter and can either curtail or withdraw the benefit granted earlier.  The concept of the larger public interest introduced, before invocation of Section 21 of the General Clauses Act, in fact, amounts to amendment of the said provision, as notifications dated June 18, 1998 and January 25, 1999, issued under Section 49 of the Act of 1948, as well as notification dated August 7, 2000, issued under Section 24 of the Uttar Pradesh Electricity Reforms Act, 1999, are in the nature of legislations and, therefore, the principle of promissory estoppel would not apply to them.  [Para 14]\n\nThe purpose of the General Clauses Act is to place in one single statute different provisions as regards interpretations of words and legal principles which would otherwise have to be specified separately in many different Acts and Regulations.  Whatever the General Clauses Act says whether as regards the meaning of words or as regards legal principles, has to be read into every statute to which it applies.  Further, power to curtail and/or withdraw the notification issued under Section 49 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 giving rebate is implied under Section 49 itself on proper interpretation of Section 21 of the General Clauses Act.  By virtue of Sections 14 and 21 of the General Clauses Act, when a power is conferred on an authority to do a particular act, such power can be exercised from time to time and carry with it power to withdraw, modify, amend or cancel the notifications earlier issued, to be exercised in the like manner and subject to like conditions, if any, attached with the exercise of the power.  It would be too narrow a view to accept that chargeability once fixed cannot be altered.  Since the charging provision in the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 is subject to the State Government's power to issue notification under Section 49 of the Act granting rebate, the State Government, in view of Section 21 of the General Clauses Act, can always withdraw, rescind, add to or modify an exemption notification.  No industry can claim as of right that the Government should exercise its power under Section 49 and offer rebate and it is for the Government to decide whether the conditions are such that rebate should be granted or not.  [Para 13]\n\nThe legal effect would be that the finding recorded in (2008)2 SCC 777 that the notification dated 18-6-1998 and 25-1-1999 reducing the rate of rebate from 33.33% to 17% were bad in law will have to be regarded as not laying down correct proposition of law.  Thus, the petitioners in the present writ petition are not entitled to claim promissory estoppel against the Government and would not be entitled to any benefit on the basis of two Judge Bench judgment in (2008)2 SCC 777 referred to earlier. The petitioners cannot raise plea of estoppel against the notification dated August 7, 2000 reducing Hill Development Rebate to 0% as there can be no estoppel against the statute.  (2008)2 SCC 777 - Overruled.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 16,17]"

In my view the consumer is liable to pay the charges under the item LD-2 of tariff, the tariff which is applicable for power supply to non-domestic, commercial and business premises for the use of light. fan, refrigerators, heaters, cookers, radios, TV sets, etc. The consumer in fact applied for supply of electricity for the commercial purposes for the use of electricity for aforesaid purposes and he was sanctioned electricity for that purpose and, therefore, he was liable to pay charges under the tariff accordingly. The mistake was committed by the Board in raising the bills to the consumer charging rates under item LTP-G to which consumer was not entitled and since the mistake was detected, later on the supplementary bills were raised. The trial court, therefore, was justified in passing the decree in favour of the board permitting it to recover Rs.37,527.39 p.s. with interest @ 12% p.a. from the date of bills till full realisation and the appeal court seriously erred in reversing the said judgment and decree passed by the trial court.  [Para 12]\n\nMerely because under the Industrial Disputes Act, it happens to be an 'Industry' or an 'Industrial establishment' for the purposes of Income Tax Act or is excluded from the definition of 'commercial establishment' under the Bombay Shops & Establishments Act, 1948, the supply of power to commercial premises and use of the electrical supply by a hotel for commercial purposes cannot be excluded from the tariff issued by the Board for charging the electrical supply to the commercial and business premises. The definition of 'industry' under the Industrial Disputes Act, 'Industrial undertaking' under the Income Tax Act, and, the 'commercial establishment' under the Bombay Shops & Establishments Act is confined to such expressions for the said statutes only and by no stretch of imagination can it be held that since hotel is an industry under the Industrial Disputes Act, the board could only charge the tariff fixed for industrial use."

Clause 16.9 lays down the formula for calculating the value of the electrical energy abstracted or consumed by a consumer by exceeding the contracted load or by creating obstruction in running of meter. Part (III) of this clause deals with method of charging the assessed units and sub-para (a) thereof lays down that the consumption so assessed shall be charged at thrice the rate per unit of the Tariff applicable to the consumer excluding the consumption recorded by the meter and the latter shall be charged at the appropriate Tariff rates. Clause 16.10.3 is a separate clause which deals with fuel surcharge  and it nowhere lays down that this additional surcharge will also be levied at thrice the rate per unit of the tariff. The two clauses namely 16.9 and 16.10.3 have to be read separately and there being no specific provision for assessing the fuel charge at thrice the rate per unit, it is not possible to hold that in such a case the fuel surcharge should also be charged at thrice the rate per unit.

It contemplates a meter which is either running slow or fast with the result that it does not register the correct amount of energy supplied. There is an additional reason for coming to such a conclusion. Section 26(6) confers power upon the Electrical Inspector to estimate the amount of energy supplied to the consumer or the electrical quantity contained in the supply, during such time, not exceeding six months, as the meter shall not, in the opinion of such Inspector, have been correct. Where the meter is running slow or fast, it will be possible for the Electrical Inspector to estimate the amount of energy supplied to the consumer by determining the extent or percentage of error in recording the supply, whether plus or minus. However, where the meter is burnt or is completely non-functional, such an exercise is not at all possible. Therefore, Section 26(6) can have no application in a case where a meter has become completely non-functional on account of any reason whatsoever.   [Para 9]\n\nIn the present case, the demand raised by the appellant against the first respondent can be divided into two parts :(i) for the period during which the meter was burnt, and (ii) for the period for which the meter was not correct. For the period for which the readings could not be recorded or retrieved because the meter was brunt there is nothing wrong in having raised the demand based on the average consumption for the similar period during the previous year. It is a reasonable basis. So far as the period for which the meter is said to be incorrect, the demand has not been revised by basing it on the finding arrived at by the Electrical Inspector and hence is not available to be revised. The meter is alleged by the appellant to be not correct and yet the appellant has not made a reference to the Electrical Inspector under S.26(6). The appellant cannot now be allowed to raise an additional demand over and above the demand raised through the bills which were issued for that period and paid by the respondent-consumers. The right to raise additional bills stands lost by the appellant for its failure to proceed in accordance with S.26(6).\t [Para 9,12,14]"

Where however, one party avers that the meter has not rightly recorded the energy and further avers that the meter recorded less consumption of electricity say by one unit and the other party admits that the meter is not correct and it has not recorded the consumption correctly but contends that the meter has recorded less consumption say only by half unit and not by one unit as contended by the other party, the dispute is not covered by sub-section (6) of section 26. Electrical Inspector would not get the jurisdiction much less an exclusive jurisdiction to decide such dispute. The jurisdictional fact giving the jurisdiction to the Electrical Inspector to entertain the dispute under sub-section (6) of section 26 is an assertion made by one party that the meter has not rightly recorded the energy supplied and denial of that proposition by the other party by contending that the meter has rightly recorded the electrical consumption. It is only in cases like the present one where the dispute is not covered under sub-section (6) of section 26 and where the demand made in the bill appears to be prima facie illegal or improper that the Court would grant an junction on terms considered appropriate by the Court.  Accordingly, in present case, defendants are restrained from disconnecting the electricity supply of the plaintiff on the ground of non-payment of the billed amount subject to the defendant depositing a further sum of Rs.50,000/- in addition to the sum of Rs-75,000/- already deposited, with the defendant within a period of 12 weeks. This amount should be treated as deposit and would be subject to final decision of the suit.  [Para 10,11,12,13,15,16]"

                "description": "Under-recording of electricity consumption - No dispute on the fact that meter and current transformer were correct - Defect only in wiring would not attract jurisdiction under S.26(6).\n\nSection 26(6) of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910, conditions the jurisdiction of the Electrical Inspector on the existence of a difference or dispute on whether a meter installed at the premises of the consumer is or is not correct.  The existence of such a dispute or difference is condition precedent to the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Electrical Inspector.  If there is no dispute in regard to whether the meter is defective, the fundamental requirement for the exercise of jurisdiction under section 26(6) would be absent and that such a dispute cannot be entertained by the Electrical Inspector.  The second fundamental principle which must guide the decision of the present case is that the jurisdiction of the Electrical Inspector being to adjudicate when there is a dispute whether the meter is or is not correct, a mere dispute in regard to a fault in the wiring does not fall within the ambit of section 26(6).\t [Para 14,15,16]\n\nIn the present case, the first respondent did not dispute the factual position that there was nothing intrinsically wrong or erroneous with the meter.  In fact, his case was that the lower consumption of electricity was due to the problems which were faced by him in his own factory.  Insofar as the Undertaking was concerned, its case also was that there was nothing intrinsically wrong about the meter but there was an under recording of electricity consumed to the extent of 66% because of the defect in wiring associated with the current transformer.  Both the Electrical Inspector and the appellate authority have been fundamentally in error in the view which they took in affirming their own jurisdiction on the ground that though the meter was detected to be faulty on 7th December, 1995, \"no information was given to the consumer about a possible percentage error and billing average, but that a bill was directly served on him after a lapse of one year.\"  In the Memo of appeal that was filed before the appellate authority, the petitioner pointed out that the Inspector erred in coming to this conclusion since the record indicated that intimation was given to the consumer which was duly acknowledged by his representative on 7th December, 1995 and that he was personally present when the testing was carried out by the Energy Department of the Undertaking.  The order of the appellate authority, to say the least, shows a complete non-application of mind to the issue of jurisdiction.  The Appellate Authority held that the meter and its wiring are independent and separate.  Of this position there can be no dispute.  The Appellate Authority notes that the meter and its current transformer are inter-related and that without the C.T., the consumption on the meter cannot be recorded when there is a C.T. operated meter.  Again there can be no dispute about this proposition, nor indeed in the view of the appellate authority that if there is a defect in the meter, it cannot record a proper reading.  The appellate authority held that it is essential that the C. T. of the meter and the meter should both be correct.  Having said this, the appellate authority then proceeded to hold that section 26(6) was applicable and that a supplementary bill could not exceed a period of six months.  The conclusion of the appellate authority does not flow from its premise.  What the appellate authority completely lost sight of was the absence of any dispute between the parties on the fact that both the meter and the C.T. were correct.  Once that was the position, then a defect in the wiring would not attract the jurisdiction under section 26(6). [Para 18,19]"

However, in a case where the meter has totally stopped functioning or where the parties do not dispute that the meter is malfunctioning, there remains hardly any scope for any investigation by the Inspector or for utilisation of his expertisation in the field, and therefore, in such a situation, there cannot be any occasion for the Inspector to exercise his powers under the Section 26(6) of the said Act.

In fact, the sub-clause (c) of the Clause 18 of Conditions and Miscellaneous charges for supply of Electrical Energy does give indication in that regard wherein it has been clearly stated that pursuant to failure on the part of the consumer to pay the amount demanded in terms of the bills served upon him, the petitioner is empowered to disconnect the supply after issuance of seven days notice without prejudice to their right to recover the amount of the bill by a suit.  Undoubtedly, the said clause relates to the bill prepared on the basis of the meter reading and the dispute sought to be raised in that regard by the consumer in terms of the Section 26(6) of the said Act. However, it reveals that the petitioner, in the absence of the provision under the said Act or the Rules framed thereunder, is not entitled to assume itself the authority to decide about the liability of the consumer even in cases of default on the part of the petitioner itself in not replacing the meter inspite of the fact that the meter was defective and the same was brought to the notice of the petitioner by the consumer and yet the petitioner had allowed to continue the defective meter to remain installed at the establishment of the consumer for a considerably long period and thereafter had sought to claim the amount as arrears.  In this regard, the bill which was issued by the petitioner reveals a claim of Rs.3,132/- for \"Additional Charges for Wrong Billing\".  Undisputedly, wrong billing was done by the petitioner itself.  It is beyond comprehension of any prudent man as to how a person who himself is responsible for the mistake committed by him, can claim the compensation from others for his own mistake.  It is absolutely ridiculous. AIR 1998 SC 849 and AIR 1995 Bom 79 - Referred to.\t [Para 19]"

                "description": "Trial of offences - Prescription of summary trial - Would result in serious prejudice and injury to accused.\n\nSub-section (7) of Section 49-C provides that notwithstanding anything contained in Section 260 or 262 of the Code of Criminal Procedure the trial of every offence under the Act is to be done in a summary way and the provisions of Sections 263 to 265 of the Code shall, as far as may be, apply to such trials. Chapter XXI of the Code of Criminal Procedure deals with summary trials. In view of the mandate of Clause (i)of sub-section (1) of Section 260 of the Code an offence which is punishable with a sentence exceeding two years cannot be tried in a summary way. Similarly, in view of sub-section (2) of Section 262 of the Code a sentence of imprisonment for a term exceeding three months cannot be passed in a summary trial. In fact sub-section (2) of Section 260 of the Code provides that when in the course of summary trial it appears to the Magistrate that the nature of the case is such that it is undesirable to try it summarily, the Magistrate shall recall any witness who may have already been examined and proceed to rehear the case in the manner provided by the Code. A Magistrate, while trying a case summarily, is required to record only the substance of the evidence and a brief statement of reasons for the finding has to be mentioned in the judgment in view of Section 264 of the Code. In summary trials, there is a clear departure from the procedure prescribed for trial of other category of cases as they are primarily meant for petty or small cases where a sentence exceeding three months cannot be imposed. But Section 2 of the Amending Act by which Section 39 has been amended has enhanced the sentence which may extend to five years' R.I. but shall not be less than three months and a fine which may extend to Rs.50,000/- but shall not be less than Rs.5,000/-. The proviso imposes a further disability upon the person convicted in the sense that he shall be debarred from getting supply of energy for a period of two years. The trial of all such cases is now mandatorily to be conducted as a summary trial and provisions of Sections 263 to 265 of Code of Criminal Procedure alone have been made applicable. The provision of Section 354 of the Code relating to language and content of judgment where the Court has to mention the point or points for determination, the decision thereon and the reasons for the decision, is in sharp contrast to Section 264 of the Code. If the complete statement of witnesses is not recorded in the manner deposed to by the witnesses and only a substance of the evidence is recorded the appellate Court will not be in a position to weigh the evidence properly and come to an independent conclusion. These provisions where summary trial has been provided, therefore, cause serious prejudice and substantial injury to the accused.   [Para 17]"

In proceedings under Article 226, the High Court cannot sit as a Court of appeal over the findings recorded by the Special Court to reappreciate the evidence for itself or to correct an error of fact (not going to jurisdiction) however apparent it might be on the ground that the evidence on which it was based was not satisfactory or sufficient, particularly when the finding of the Special Court is final under the Statute. The High Court cannot interfere with the findings of fact based on evidence and substitute its own independent findings. The only inquiry which the High Court can make under Article 226 is whether there was any evidence at all, which if believed, would sustain the charge before the Special Court or the finding arrived at by it or whether the Special Court acted upon irrelevant considerations neglecting to take account of relevant factors or whether the decision is so unreasonable that no reasonable person would have made such a decision. The proceedings under Article 226 are not a substitute for an appeal. Moreso, as under Section 386 of the Code there is no embargo on the power of the appellate Court. In an appeal from a conviction it may reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or discharge the accused or order him to be re-tried by a Court of competent jurisdiction. The conferment of power of review upon the Special Court under Section 49-G is again no substitute for an appeal as such a power is circumscribed by the language used in this section and can be granted on a very limited grounds. Therefore, sub-section (2) of Section 49-E of the Amending Act causes prejudice and serious injury to the accused. [Para 18,19]"

Electricity energy is not a tangible object.  Theft of the electricity energy has to be established by the prosecution.  It involves technical expertise.  The complainant has to establish the manner or procedure adopted, according to the case of the complainant, by the accused concerned while committing theft of the electricity energy.  In this process, it is the case of the complainant that, it can be established by performing a test of the terminal box in the Court itself.  In other words, the electricity is being taken by the consumer for its consumption through this terminal box and quantity of the electricity consumed by the consumer can be recorded legitimately for charging the said consumer.  Therefore, it may be a mode for establishing the alleged theft of the electricity.  If the prosecution wish to establish, by performing such test, in the Court, it cannot be said to be a collection of evidence by the prosecution with the assistance of the Court.  On the contrary, it leaves no doubt of room for either of the party and the adjudicator i.e. the Court, hearing the case.  The Court also can be at a benefit for arriving at a conclusion in relation to the allegations made by the complainant party.  The accused shall have a fair opportunity to cross-examine the witness and get the Court to the truth of the allegations.  This demonstration or performance of the test, by the witness, was, therefore, justifiably permitted by the trial Court.  The trial Judge has properly and legally accorded the permission in favour of the prosecution for breaking open the seal of the terminal box and for performance of the test in the Court.  Held, no illegality or perversity is being committed by the Court below while granting such permission.\t\t [Para 5]"

It is material to note that the said letter refers to the Industrial Estates at Kundaim and Madkaim and has no reference to the Cuncolim Industrial Estate where the industries belonging to the Respondent are located. Merely because some power constraints are imposed at the said two Industrial Estates by itself would not justify the Court to come to the conclusion that similar restrictions were imposed at the Cuncolim Industrial Estate. Besides that, the agreements executed between the parties have not been properly appreciated by the District Judge whilst deciding the said dispute between the parties. Another document which has been relied upon is a certificate which stipulates that the power supply was not provided from 6.00 p.m. to 11.00 p.m. everyday and from 6.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m. on alternate days due to power system constraints. There is no material on record to show that the supply of electricity on alternate days from 6.00 a.m. to 6.00 p.m. was for the entire period as claimed by the Respondent. The Respondent has also not adduced any evidence to substantiate that it was in a position to avail of the entire electrical energy contracted during the said period and that the same resulted in a loss to the Respondent. Merely producing a statement of account without any proof as to the actual capacity of the Respondent to utilize the electricity cannot saddle the Appellants with any liability for payment of the amounts on account of non supply of electrical energy. Merely because some decision has been taken to give some concession on prorata basis to the industries at Kundaim and Madkaim could not necessarily apply to the industry at Cuncolim Industrial Estate unless it is established by cogent evidence that the power supply position was the same at the said Industrial Estate.

There is no conclusive evidence on record to establish that there was any default committed by the defendants in supply of the energy which resulted in the plaintiffs being entitled to claim the amounts from the defendants.\n\nThough, it is well settled that it is for the plaintiffs to prove their case, nevertheless considering the evidence on record, there is no sufficient material adduced by the plaintiffs for the Court to come to the conclusion that there was a default in the supply of electrical energy to the plaintiffs during the contractual period which resulted in loss to the plaintiffs. 2008(5) Mh.

The definition of a \"licensee\" under the ERC Act means a person licensed under Part II of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 to supply energy or a person who has obtained sanction under section 28 of that Act to engage in the business of supplying energy. But it does not include the Electricity Board or a generating company. Thus the generating companies are excluded from the concept of 'licensee\". Then we come to the definition of \"transmission utility\". It includes generating company, board, the licensee or any person engaged in the transmission of energy. Thus the concept of \"transmission utility\" is wider than that of a \"licensee\". Then we have the concept of \"utility\" which means any person or entity engaged in the generation, transmission, sale, distribution or supply, as the case may be, of energy. Thus the concept of \"utility\" is still wider than that of the \"transmission utility\". If the concept of \"utility\" was to be restricted only to those persons who are engaged in the business of generation, or transmission, sale, etc. of energy, the legislature would have provided that specifically. There is no such specific mention and thus the concept of \"utility\" is not restricted only to those who are engaged in the generation, transmission, sale, etc. of energy for the purposes of business as is sought to be canvassed by the Petitioners. Mr. Jagtiani has submitted that these concepts are to be read as defined unless the context requires otherwise as contained in the opening part of the defining section. However, what is suggested by Mr. Jagtiani will lead to add the words \"business of\" before the word \"generation\" and would restrict the definition of \"utility\" when in fact it is defined in a wider way to cover all other concepts such as that of \"transmission utility\" or that of \"licensee\". The interpretation suggested will lead to adding and supplying words so as to reduce the scope of the concept of \"utility\". This will be contrary to legislative intent. When a Commission is constituted to have an overall authority, the legislature wanted to have a concept with widest possible coverage and that is what has been done while defining the concept of \"utility\".\t [Para 15]"

The proceedings before the Commission are regulated by these Regulations. It is provided in these Regulations as to how the proceedings are to be initiated by filing petitions, then notices of the inquiry to be issued to the Respondents, representation of parties, services of notices and processes by the Commission, filing of reply, opposition and objections, engaging of representatives on behalf of the parties, hearing of the matters by the Commission, procedure to be followed when any party does not appear before the Commission, power to pass interim order and even the power to impose costs. There is also a provision for review of the decisions of the Commission by making necessary application to the Commission when one is aggrieved. Under regulation 62(1), the Commission is supposed to pronounce its judgment in open court after the hearing is complete. All these are clear trappings of a quasi judicial authority and that is with a view to see to it that the forum decides the lis between the parties in accordance with the established procedure which is otherwise accepted in all quasi judicial authorities.\n\nIn the present case, as we have noted above, the Commission has been constituted with wide powers and to decide the disputes and differences between the licensees and the utilities. We have seen the wide scope of the definition of \"utility\" within which all the Petitioners and the Electricity Board would fall. This being the position, it would be just and proper that an authority constituted for this very purpose ought to first decide the controversies which are sought to be raised in the present petitions. As pointed out above, the common dispute in all these petitions is firstly about the circular of 2nd September 1999 whereunder a mandatory purchase of power at certain percentage is being insisted on parties which have their own CPP plus a certain tariff is being insisted upon. This should surely be within the scope and power of the Commission. As far as the first petition is concerned, there are two additional issues; firstly with respect to the reduction of the contract demand and the facility which the Petitioners want to have across the road i.e. the supply which they intend to have to their own plant across the road. The case of the Respondent Board is that they are required to keep a standby arrangement and hence all these arrangements, whether they are legal or valid, will have to be looked into. The Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission surely has the power and the authority to look into all these controversies. AIR 1952 SC 192 - Referred to.\t [Para 17,18]"

P.C. are applicable and no special procedure formulated for dealing with offences under Electricity Act, filing of FIR and taking cognizance upon police report, not barred.\n\nIt is apparent from the reading of S.4 of Cr. P.C. that Criminal Procedure Code would be applicable where an offence under the IPC or under any other law is being investigated, inquired into, tried or otherwise dealt with. These offences under any other law could also be investigated, inquired into or tried with according to the provisions of the Code except in case of an offence where the procedure prescribed there under is different than the procedure prescribed under the Code. It is so specifically provided under Section 155 of the Electricity Act also. Thus, it is not a case where any special or different procedure is prescribed. Rather, the procedure contained the Code is made applicable for the offences to be tried under the Electricity Act as well. \t     [Para 21]\n\nEven when a Magistrate is to take cognizance when a complaint is filed before it, that would not mean that no other avenue is opened and the complaint/FIR cannot be lodged with the police. The offences under the Electricity Act are also to be tried by applying the procedure contained in the Code. Thus, it cannot be said that a complete machinery is provided under the Electricity Act as to how such offences are to be dealt with. In view thereof, if the offence under the Code is cognizable, provisions of Chapter XII containing Section 154 Cr.P.C. and onward would become applicable and it would be the duty of the police to register the FIR and investigate into the same. Sections 135 and 138 only prescribe that certain acts relating to theft of electricity etc. would also be offences. It also enables certain persons/parties, as mentioned in Section 151, to become complainant in such cases and file complaint before a Court in writing. When such a complaint is filed, the Court would be competent to take cognizance straightway. However, that would not mean that other avenues for investigation into the offence which are available would be excluded. It is more so when no such special procedure for trying the offences under the Electricity Act is formulated and the cases under this Act are also to be governed by the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\n(2010) 2 KLJ 569, (2006) 1 C Cr LJ (cal) 334, (2007) 2 KLT 733, MANU/TN/0584/2010 Held, Not Good Law.\n\n(2010) Cri LJ 271 Approved. \t     [Para 23]"

                "description": "Applicability of EPF Act - To aided or non-aided private educational institutions - Determination of - Educational institutions are covered by EPF Act - However, private schools which fall under Rules introduced by State Government under Private Schools Act and those are exempted by S.16 of EPF Act, are not covered under EPF Act - Those private schools which are controlled or owned by State Government would be covered by Rr.19 & 20 of Rules (1981) - Employees working in aided or unaided schools to subscribe to contributory provident fund under Contributory Provident Fund Rules (Bombay) - As such State Government has administrative control over them - EPF Act not applicable to aided or non-aided private educational institutions - However, EPF Act applicable to such schools for period prior to coming into force of Rules (1981).\n\n\tIn all these petitions a common point of law has been urged by the learned counsel for the petitioners in as much as inview of the provisions of Section 16(1)(c) of the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952. The said act is not applicable to the employees of private schools asthey are entitled for pension etc. Under the M.E.P.S.Act,1977 and the Rules thereunder. Keeping in view the law laid down by the Hon'ble Apex Court in the D.A.V. College case, there can be no dispute that Educational Institutions would be covered by the E.P.F.Act, 1952.Considering the law laid down in the Sanatan Dharam Case,the distinction would be that those schools, which are exempted u/s16 of the E.P.F. Act, would not be covered by the E.P.F. Act and would be governed by the Rules introduced by the State Government.Consequentially, those private schools, which do not fall under the Rules introduced by the State Government under the Private Schools Act and are not exempted by Section 16 of the E.P.F. Act, would thus continue to be covered under the E.P.F. Act.There is no dispute in all these cases that the petitioners aresuch educational institutions which are not owned by the Central Government or the State Government. Many of these institution stermed as private schools or colleges, are receiving salary grants and non salary grants being extended to such schools.Those private schools which are controlled or owned by State Government would be covered by Rule 19 and 20 of M.E.P.S. Rules. As a result, all such employees (except those who have opted for pension) working in aided or unaided schools are mandated to subscribe to the contributory provident fund under the Contributory Provident Fund Rules (Bombay). Consequentially, keeping in viewthat the State Government has administrative control even if a schoolor college is not operated on grant-in-aid basis, Rule 20(1) would make it mandatory for every employee, who has not opted for pension, to subscribe to the C.P.F. notwithstanding whether he is working full time or part time in an aided or unaided school. Therefore EPF Act not applicable to aided or non-aided private schools. In all these matters before the Court, the periods for which recovery is initiated by the respondent A.P.F.C. is post introduction of Rule 20 under the 1981 Rules, which were brought into effect on16/07/1981. These rules have been framed under Section 16(1) and (2) of the M.E.P.S. Act, 1977. In this view of the matter, it is quiteevident that after the introduction of Rule 20 from 16/07/1981, the authority under the E.P.F. Act would have no jurisdiction to recover P.F.dues in relation to every employee who has subscribed to the C.P.F. If any period of service for which P.F. Contributions are due from any educational institution prior to 16/07/1981, the P.F.Authorities under the E.P.F. Act couldexercise jurisdiction for recovering the dues. 988 (Suppl) SCC 518, 2007 ALL SCR 766 Rel. on. \t\t [Para 8,20,21,22]"

Therefore, a company is primarily liable for an offence under the Act.  The said liability may extend to other persons only under the conditions laid down in the aforesaid Section.  In other words, vicarious liability only arises to the directors if the conditions laid down for the provision under Section 14-A are fulfilled.  A director of a company may be concerned only with the policy to be followed and he may not have any role in the management of the day to day affairs of the company.  Such persons are, in other words immune from prosecution.  In the instant complaint/report filed, apart from the allegation and the statement made by the informant that the Directors of the Company have legal duty to deposit the provident fund, there is no other averment or material from which the learned Magistrate could have satisfied himself that petitioners are either responsible for the conduct of the business of the Company or they took part in the running of it.   [Para 11]\n\nFurthermore, there is a specific bar against the Court taking cognizance and proceeding with trial of such offences under Section 14-AC, except on a report in writing of the facts constituting such offence made with previous sanction of the Central Provident Fund Commissioner or such other officer as may be authorized by the Central Government.  Therefore, making of bald allegations in the complaint, is not enough to attract the provisions under the Act of 1952.  The facts essential to constitute the offence attracting the provisions have to be stated.  Therefore, in the absence of necessary allegations of the facts attracting the provisions of the Act of 1952 or the Indian Penal Code, it cannot be said that the prosecution launched and cognizance taken by the Magistrate, in the instant case, against accused petitioners was proper.

Therefore, the petitioner-Chairman of the company could not have been prosecuted under Section 406 Indian Penal Code for non-deposit with the Provident Fund Authorities of the provident fund dues deducted from the employees salary.

In exercise of this provision while framing the Scheme paragraph 27 has been framed, which empowers the Commissioner to grant exemption to individual employee.  Thus, paragraph 27 has its source in sub-section 2 of Section 17 and therefore when the Commissioner grants exemption under paragraph 27, exemption relates to the provisions of Section 17 of the Act and therefore the provisions of paragraph 27-AA will also be applicable to the applications which are made under paragraph 27 for exemption by an individual employee, because though the order granting exemption is made under paragraph 27, the substantive provision enabling grant of such exemption is to be found in Section 17(2) of the Act.  It is to be seen here that these conditions which are mentioned in Appendix-A are to be imposed to safeguard the interest of the employees.  It does not stand to reason that imposition of such condition would be necessary when a class of employees is to be exempted, whereas it will not apply where an individual employee is to be exempted.  It can not be forgetton that though applications may be made by individual employees, if all the applications are taken together, in reality the applications are by a class of employees who are employed in a particular establishment.  If it is assumed that paragraph 27-AA does not apply to exemption granted under paragraph 27, then it would mean that though as a result of grant of exemption to individual employee the entire class of employees employed in a particular establishment gets exempted.  Conditions mentioned in Appendix-A are not applicable.  But if in stead of individual employee making applications, an application is made for exemption by class of employees namely employees working in particular establishment, the conditions would be applicable.  In our opinion, such a situation would be anomalous and would tend to defeat the purpose for which the paragraph 27-AA has been incorporated.  It can not be forgetton that these conditions are being imposed by the Central Government while granting exemption to the establishment under sub-section (1) of Section 17, because the Central Government found that imposition of such condition is necessary for safeguarding the interest of the employees and greater control on the Private Provident Fund scheme is necessary to dilute the risk factors which are involved in the Private Provident Fund Schemes.  The result of incorporation of paragraph 27-AA is that now whether an establishment is exempted or a class of employees is exempted or individual employees are exempted, the conditions which are applicable will be uniform.

If the order is not indicating application of mind in relation to these heads, the order is a nonspeaking order.  Not only this but the Authority exercising the function to assess damages in paragraph read with Section is exercising quasi judicial function, and therefore, it has to take into account the difficulties placed before it by the employers.  The contentions that the Authority is therefore obliged to levy damages at the maximum rate prescribed in paragraph does not appear to be correct.  The discretion in the matter is very much available with the Authority.  Even the plain language of paragraph 32-A shows that the word used therein is \"may\".  Those provisions have been brought into force from 1-9-1991 and if the framers of scheme wanted to force the authority to recover damages at the maximum rate specified in the table, there was no need to use the word \"may\".  The word \"shall\" could have been very well used in it. Para 32-A cannot be interpreted to defeat the scheme of S.14-B of the Act.\t [Para 10]"

This is the essential purpose, of Section 14B of the EPF Act, and an imposition within its confines does not assume criminal prosecution so as to stand proscribed insofar as transfer of establishment from one management/employer to its successor is concerned. Section 17B specifically speaks of \"the contributions and other sums due from the employer under any provision of this Act or the Scheme\" (emphasis added). The proviso to Section 17B indeed clarifies the position inasmuch as it restricts and/or limits the liability of the transferee up to the date of the transfer to the value of the assets obtained by him through such transfer.\n\nSection 14B is complete in itself so far as the computation of damages is concerned. It is conceivable that the money due from an employer would have to be calculated under Section 7A, and in the event the default or neglect of the employer is contumacious and contains the requisite mens rea and actus reus yet another exercise of computation has to be undertaken under Section 14B. Where the Authority is of the opinion that damages under Section 14B need to be imposed, the computations would come within the purview of Section 14B and it would be recoverable jointly and severally from the erstwhile as well as the current managements. A perusal of the Appeals Section, namely, 7I is illustrative of the fact that these exercises are distinct from each other as per the enumerations found in the first sub-Section of Section 7I. It also appears logical, in the wake of the numerous and different dates of amendments, that Section 7A(2) would also be available to proceedings under Section 14B of the Act. [Para 10,11,12]"

                ],
                "description": "Temporary or casual workers engaged in construction work either directly or through contractors - Applicability of provisions of amended scheme - Proceedings under S.7-A are to be conducted and fair hearing must be given to parties before applying provision.\n\nThe issue of facts can be decided after giving due opportunity to parties in section 7-A proceedings.  Para 26-B of 1952 Scheme provides for resolution of doubts which lays down that if any question anises whether an employee is entitled or required to become or continue as a member, or as regards the date from which he is so entitled or required to become a member, the decision there on of the Regional Commissioner shall be final.  It also states that no decision in this respect shall be given unless both the employer and the employee have been heard.\t [Para 8A]\n\nThe purpose of the Act is not to impose some levy upon employer or employees.  It is not in the nature of tax but the purpose is to develop habit of saving in such employees.  Identification of employees is therefore must before effecting such recovery.  It is the part of wages earned by such employees which is being deducted by the P.F. department and ultimately it is to be returned back to him.  If his identity is not known, the amount cannot definitely be returned to him and as such there is no point in effecting deduction from employer on account of such unknown worker.  Habit of saving cannot be developed unless and until the wages are earned continuously and consistently.\t [Para 8B]\n\nIn the instant case, the establishments of the Petitioners are already covered under P. F. Act.  Question is whether a worker whether on site or otherwise, of petitioner employed directly or indirectly briefly can be treated as part of establishment of petitioner or can he be treated as part of establishment of a contractor who deputes him to said site and if he cannot be associated either with petitioner or such contractor, whether he is to be ignored even though he has performed work of regular nature of establishment of petitioner.  This can be found out by applying \"control test\" or \"integration test\".  It cannot be ruled out that there may be contractors undertaking only specialised jobs like electrification, plumbing, interior decoration etc. and these contractors may simultaneously work on different sites of more than one establishment like that of Petitioners and depute their skilled labour to such sites & rotate them depending upon need.  Here, the tests will have to be invoked to find out whether there is employer-employee relationship between petitioner and such worker/employee.  But when such employee who frequently changes his employer/contractor and therefore, either himself does not accept an obligation or on whom there is no obligation to report for duty every day, if he can be identified & reached, benefit of coverage can be extended to him.  Considering human tendency, it is not possible to presume that any worker would generally not like stability or continuity of work.  But still if there exists such worker, in absence of proper scheme under P. F. Act to keep his track, it is difficult to establish his identity and to deliver the benefit to him.  But the provisions of section 2(f) are very clear in this respect and the moment ingredients thereof are satisfied, the worker becomes employee employed for wages in establishment of petitioner and insistence upon some continuity is therefore unwarranted.  Therefore, there need not be lasting bond or relationship of employer and employee between parties casting obligation upon employee to report for duty as per directions of his employer on next day.  By performing work which is of regular nature and of establishment of any of the Petitioners, or other work in connection with such regular work which is routinely available with petitioner, an employee who has so worked even for a single day can be said to have joined his employment and establishment.  For said definition-clause \"joining\" is not a question of intention to be examined in the light of material on record.  There may be some difficulty in establishing employee's identity or in making benefits reach to him but that cannot halt the implementation of P. F. Act.  Unless and until the P. F. department makes provision like his enrollment with some central board and puts obligation upon all contractors and employers to provide work only to such registered workers, such situation cannot be taken care of.  Preparation of any scheme in this respect may be very difficult on account of the very nature of working of system as it is mostly illiterate villagers who come to towns & cities in search of such manual work.  Any person ready and willing to work offers himself for such manual work and is hired by needy person or contractor & this part of activity of making the work available to employee is neither organised nor regulated by any law.  If condition of registration of workers is imposed, a new migrant to city or needy labour may find it difficult to earn livelihood.  Not only this, any worker may later work at house of any person for the repairs etc. for doing private work and get paid directly through house owner.  In that event he will not be working in any establishment & hence not covered by P. F. Act.  [Para 8C]\n\nWhile investigating and examining records of contractors or builders or subcontractors or of petty contractors engaged by Petitioners, the P. F. department in process of identifying the workers may be in position to link a particular worker to any one of them because of continuation of such worker under him for some time.  Such worker, if facts support, may then be treated as employee of that establishment (other than that of petitioner) by examining the situation in the light of \"integration test\" and \"control test\" on various other factors.  Then if other conditions are satisfied, such employee may be entitled to coverage from date of joining that establishment.  Such particular contractors or builders or subcontractors or petty contractors in that event can be made accountable for deductions of such employee/worker or site worker depending upon the agreement between them & Petitioner.  Even if this little stability or saving becomes possible for such freelance worker/employee, that will also further the cause of P. F. Act.  [Para 8C]\n\nIn the instant case, steps taken by authority in relation to identification of workers are not apparent and all requirements in this respect are to be fulfilled before effecting recovery.  Expenditure shown as wages in balance sheet has been acted upon without verifying the actual part thereof appropriated towards payment of wages by Employer.  The quantification of amount without identifying beneficiaries or any attempt to recover it is therefore unsustainable.  It is to be kept in mind that the purpose of inquiry is twofold.  The employees joining the establishment under scrutiny in future will definitely be benefited.  However finding out quantum of evaded contribution amount and its recovery has to be for workers who are identified and to whom P. F. department can deliver their due savings.  Inquiry therefore has to be to ascertain and identify such workers whose legal rights have been defeated & powers are to be used for this purpose.\t [Para 10]"

                "description": "Constitutional validity of S.7-Q - Provisions about levy of interest for delay in payment of Contribution - Not unconstitutional as it stands the test of reasonableness under Arts.14, 19(1)(g) and 20(1).\n\nThe object of the Act as noted is to protect the interest of the employees and when such contribution is being made and recovered from the salary/wages of the employees, it is the bounden duty on the part of the employer as well to contribute its contribution and to pay towards the fund as a matter of security for life of the employee as is envisaged under Art.21 of the Constitution.  The very Scheme provided for contribution and any lapse in remitting such contribution from time to time in the usual course should earn interest as when such an amount is deposited by way of Fund at a future date to be withdrawn by the employee on retirement, necessarily it should earn interest and keeping it idle will be detrimental to the interest of the employee.  In such circumstances, the provision under S.7-Q is introduced as a regulatory measure thereby directing the employer to systematically deposit the funds and it cannot be either termed as discriminatory or as against the freedom of trade and profession of the employer much less it does not amount to any such imposition by way of violation of Art.20(1) of the Constitution.  There is also no question of punishing the same person twice by way of imposing penalty.  What is contemplated under S.7-Q is only payment of interest whereas S.14-B refers to payment of damages on such failure to pay the contribution regularly.  These are two distinct aspects which cannot be held and treated as a concept of double jeopardy.  Section 7-Q only contemplates payment of interest on failure to make contribution well in time as in the usual course such deposit would have necessarily earned interest and that interest would be paid by the concerned Department/Government. In so far as imposing of damages is concerned, it is also a matter of regulatory measure to discipline the employer to avoid any such lapse and if such a stringent measure is taken and contemplated under the Act, that cannot be termed either as arbitrary or violative of the freedom of profession.  However, at the discretion of the authorities, the damages may be or may not be awarded.  Only in extreme circumstances when there is criminal default by the employer, such stringent measures would be taken.  [Para 9,10]"

At the same time, the expression \"such as\" indicates that the ambit of the words which precede it must be construed contextually with the category or type constituted by the words that follow. Hence, establishments which fall within the purview of the words \"expert services\" must be those which fall within the same type as those that follow the words \"such as\". The establishment must provide expert services and the nature of those services must be of the same nature as those specifically provided. Thus, while the words \"such as\" indicate that the establishments that are specifically spelt out are not exhaustive of the establishments which are covered by the notification, the question as to whether other establishments which are not specifically covered would be included, would depend upon the nature of the business and the nature of the activities carried on by the establishment. The question that arises before the Court is as to whether establishments supplying personnel or rendering advice on departmental enquiries or providing special services in rectifying pilferage, thefts and pay roll irregularities can be regarded as falling within a particular type or class. Undoubtedly, those establishments do fall within a specific class or category. The establishments which have been spelt out can meaningfully be regarded as providing services in relation to manpower control or manpower related services. The establishments which are specifically named include those which supply personnel. Such establishments engage in the business of providing manpower to a client in areas of expertise or specialization. Similarly, advice in relation to domestic or departmental enquiries covers a specialised area of manpower regulation, namely, the regulation of misconduct by employees of the establishment. The provision of special services in rectifying pilferage, thefts and pay roll irregularities covers another facet of manpower control namely, an area where misdemeanor involving the property and finances of the employer is sought to be controlled by the provision of expert services. Establishments which provide services of an expert nature in the aforesaid areas can fairly be deduced to be falling within a particular type. Therefore, while the words \"such as\" would indicate that the categories which have been expressly spelt out, are not exhaustive of the coverage of the notification, the notification must be read in its natural and ordinary course as covering only those establishments which render services of an expert nature analogous to services which have been expressly catalogued.  2001(2) ALL MR 629, (2002)1 SCC 367 and 2002(4) SCC 539 - Ref. to.\t [Para 7]"

By way of example it was held that overtime allowance, though it is generally in force in all concerns is not earned by all employees of a concern.

                "description": "Infancy protection - Scope and applicability of S.2-A - No unity of management - Workforce of the Appellant not the same as that of the Second Respondent - No commonality of ownership - Absolutely no evidence of functional integrality - Provisions of S.2-A, not attracted - Order treating the establishment of Appellant as a part of the establishment of Second Respondent - Order not being proper, quashed and set aside.\n\nThe facts of the present case would have to be assessed on the basis of the plain intendment and language of Section 2-A bearing in mind the interpretation that has been placed in the judgments to which a reference has already been made. The material that has been placed on record would show that both the Appellant and the Second Respondent are independent bodies each with its distinct corporate personality. There is absolutely no material to establish that there was a unity of management, supervision, control or employment. The workforce of the Appellant was not the same as that of the Second Respondent. Each of the two Companies had its own workforce and an employee of one Company was not transferable to the other. There was no financial inter-connection. The only basis on which the First Respondent came to hold that the Appellant is a part of the establishment of the Second Respondent was the agreement dated 1st May, 1984 that was entered into between the parties. By the agreement, the Second Respondent permitted the Appellant to use the registered Trade Mark 'Victor' on a non-exclusive basis in the territories of the States of Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh in relation to four designs of men's undergarments against the payment of royalty. The agreement between the parties undoubtedly does contemplate that the Second Respondent as a registered holder of the Trade Mark would be entitled to ensure that the products manufactured by the Appellant met the standard of quality that was associated with the mark of the Second Respondent. The conditions that have been imposed in the agreement in that regard are only intended to subserve the object of ensuring that the distinctiveness of the Trade Mark of the Second Respondent is not diluted. A Trade Mark has associated with it the goodwill generated by the business of the owner. A proprietor of a mark who permits the use of the mark by another, is entitled to impose conditions that ensure that the goodwill associated with the mark is not diluted and that the distinctiveness of the mark is not obliterated. The conditions of such an agreement, in this case, however, do not efface the position that both the Appellant and the Second Respondent were independent entities which had entered into an arms length transaction for a limited purpose. The Appellant produced material to indicate that it was engaged in the manufacture of several products besides those for which it was licensed by the Second Respondent. The balancesheet of the Appellant for the year ending 31st March, 1985 showed total sale of Rs.53.58 lakhs against which royalty payable to the Second Respondent was only Rs.2,39,999/-. The royalty, therefore, constituted 0.55% of the total income from sales. Similarly, the material produced by the Appellant showed that gents undergarments manufactured under licence for that year constituted approximately 2227 dozen valued at Rs.1.5 lakhs while similar products of the Appellant which were not under licence were to the extent of 4438 dozen valued at Rs.5.18 lakhs. Apart from this, there is absolutely no evidence of functional integrality. The closure of the unit of the Appellant would not result in the closure of the unit of the Second Respondent or vice versa. There is no commonality of ownership, management or of the workforce.\n\nIn these circumstances, the finding of the Learned Single Judge in affirming the order passed by the First Respondent is clearly in error. The decision of the First Respondent was clearly contrary to the law as interpreted in the judgment of the Supreme Court in Dharamsi Morarji and the judgments of Bombay High Court to which a reference has been made earlier.\n\nIn the circumstances, the appeal will have to be allowed and is accordingly allowed. The judgment of the Learned Single Judge dated 19th February, 1997 shall stand set aside. The order passed by the First Respondent treating the establishment of the Appellant as a part of the establishment of the Second Respondent is quashed and set aside. However, while disposing of the petition, it is clarified that upon the expiry of the period of protection under Section 16 of the Act, as it then stood at the material time, the Appellant would be liable to be covered by the provisions of the Act albeit as an independent and separate establishment.

The provisions of Act of 1952 gives priority over the statutory as well as non-statutory, secured as well as unsecured debts including mortgage or pledge.\n\nThe petitioner-bank (secured creditor) cannot overcome this situation by pointing out that there is prohibition for sale of sugar stipulated by provisions of Act of 1955.  For, the Act of 1955 does not create any higher right in favour of petitioner, who is only a secured creditor.\n\nMoreover u/s.3-D of Act of 1955, bar is placed on the sugar factory to sell or otherwise dispose of or deliver any kind of sugar or remove any kind of sugar from the bonded godowns of sugar factory.  The sale of sugar in the case on hand is not by sugar factory as such.  It is involuntary sale by P.F.C. to recover the outstanding amount of provident fund of employees.  P.F.C. is neither producer, importer, exporter or recognised dealer (on whom the bar is placed).\n\nThus, there is no absolute prohibition under Act of 1955 against the involuntary sale of sugar on account of Court order or attachment and sale by the authority concerned in exercise of its powers under Law which provides for priority such as Act of 1952.\n\nFurthermore, it is submitted that Central Government has been issuing periodical quota for sale in favour of sugar factory in relation to the sugar kept in bonded godowns of the sugar factory.\n\nThe sale of 6000 quintals of sugar by P.F.C. therefore can be adjusted against the allotted quota of sugar factory.\n\nPetitioner-bank (secured creditor) cannot challenge the authority of P.F.C. to continue with the intended action so as to recover the outstanding amount towards provident fund dues of employees which was payable by the employer i.e. sugar factory, so long as the sale does not breach the quota of sugar factory allotted by Central Government.  There is nothing on record to hold that in fact the sale of 6000 quintals of sugar exceeds the limits of quota allotted to the sugar factory by Central Government. 2009 ALL SCR 2578 - Rel. on.

Unity of ownership, unity of management and control, unity of finance, unity of labour, unity of employment and unity of functional integrality were the tests, which have been applied. In the case of The Associated Cement Companies, Ltd., it has been held that in one case the unity of ownership, management and control may be the important tests, in another case functional integrality or general unity may be an important test, and in still another case the unity of employment may be an important test. In the case of Management of Pratap Press, it has been held that of all these tests, the twin test, i.e. one of functional integrality and the other of unity of finance, employment and labour, has been held to be an important test. The \"functional integrality\" means such functional interdependence that one unit cannot co-exist conveniently and reasonably without the other. On the question of unity of ownership, it has been held that there is almost always likelihood also of unity of management. On the further question, whether in the matters of finance and employment, the conduct of the employer himself has been considered to find out whether the employer has actually kept the two units distinct or integrated. No doubt, it has been held in the case of Dharamsi Morarji Chemical Co. Ltd., that mere common ownership and shifting of 5 to 6 employees from one establishment to the other establishment is not enough to satisfy the test whether both the establishments can be treated as a part and parcel of one establishment for the purpose of entitlement of infancy period under Section 16(1)(d) of the EPF Act. \n\nIn view of above, what should be the dominant and real test to be adopted to hold that two or more units form part and parcel of the same establishment, will depend upon the facts and circumstances of each case. It is not necessary that in all cases, the dominant test would be of functional integrality. Where the admitted position is that there is no functional integrality or there is unity of ownership, the other tests of unity of management and control, unity of finance, unity of labour and employment would gain more significance. The Court will also have to find out as to whether the employer has expanded the existing business under different name or whether he has treated two units as different or integrated. Apart from this, the object and purpose of the provision for which such exercise is being carried out will have to be kept in mind. The Court will have to proceed cautiously and balance the conflicting interests. While doing this, it will have to be seen that neither the real and genuine units are deprived of the exemption nor such exemption is made available to undeserving and ineligible units.\n\nAIR 1960 SC 1213; (1998) 2 SCC 446; (2001) 1 SCC 1 and AIR 1960 SC 56 - Ref to.

The workers and other employees provide services of different kinds and ensure continuous production of goods, which are made available to the society at large. Therefore, a legislation made for their benefit must receive a liberal and purposive interpretation keeping in view the Directive Principles of State Policy contained in Articles 38 and 43 of the Constitution.  [Para 22]\n\nBy virtue of the non obstante clause contained in Section 11(2) of the EPF Act, any amount due from an employer shall be deemed to be first charge on the assets of the establishment and is payable in priority to all other debts including the debts due to a bank, which falls in the category of secured creditor.  [Para 30]\n\nThe argument that the non obstante clause contained in the subsequent legislation, i.e. Section 529A(1) of the Companies Act should prevail over similar clause contained in an earlier legislation, i.e. Section 11(2) of the EPF Act sounds attractive, but if the two provisions are read in the light of the objects sought to be achieved by the legislature by enacting the same, it is not possible to sustain the argument. The object of the amendment made in the EPF Act by Act No.40 of 1973 was to treat the dues payable by the employer as first charge on the assets of the establishment and to ensure that the same are recovered in priority to other debts. As against this, the amendments made in the Companies Act in 1985 are intended to create a charge pari passu in favour of the workmen on every security available to the secured creditors of the company for recovery of their debts. There is nothing in the language of Section 529A which may give an indication that legislature wanted to create first charge in respect of the workmen's dues, as defined in Sections 529(3)(b) and 529A and debts due to the secured creditors.  [Para 36]\n\nThe effect of the amendment made in the Companies Act in 1985 is only to expand the scope of the dues of workmen and place them at par with the debts due to secured creditors and there is no reason to interpret this amendment as giving priority to the debts due to secured creditor over the dues of provident fund payable by an employer. Of course, after the amount due from an employer under the EPF Act is paid, the other dues of the workers will be treated at par with the debts due to secured creditors and payment thereof will be regulated by the provisions contained in Section 529(1) read with Section 529(3), 529A and 530 of the Companies Act.

Therefore, in terms of Section 12-A of the Standing Orders Act, the Model Standing Orders are deemed to be applicable.  Section 2(f) of the Act defines an employee to include an apprentice, but at the same time makes an exclusion in the case of an apprentice engaged under the Apprentices Act or under the Standing Orders.  Under the Model Standing Orders an apprentice is described as a learner who is paid allowance during the period of training.  In the case at hand, trainees were paid stipend during the period of training.  They had no right to employment, nor any obligation to accept any employment, if offered by the employer.  Therefore, the trainees were 'apprentices' engaged under the 'Standing Orders' of the establishment.  Above being the position, it cannot be said that the concerned 45 trainees were employees in terms of Section 2(f) of the Act.  In other words, an apprentice engaged under the Apprentices Act or under the Standing Orders is excluded from the definition of an 'employee' as per Section 2(f) of the Act.\t [Para 10,11,12]"

The remainder of the notification shows the exclusion.  There is no comma before and after the words \"other than Indian Railways\" hence it is impossible to accept that only I.R is excluded from the notification.  The exclusion is not only for I.R but for I.R and other Railway Establishment owned and controlled by the C.G or S.Gs.  The KR is an establishment owned by the C.G.  The KR is excluded from the said notification.  Consequently KR is not covered under Section 1(3) of the PFA including its proviso.  Further being an establishment under the control of the C.G and having its own contributory PF and Pension Scheme it would be exempt under Section 16(b) of the PFA.  Further KR is soon to amalgamate into the Indian Railways.  It has got its own individual separate contributory P.F as well as old age pension schemes.  It is, therefore, exempt from the provisions of the PFA under Section 16(1)(b) thereof.  Moreover KR itself is desirous of its employees availing of its contributory scheme.  That is the scheme applicable to the employees of the I.R.  The employees would therefore, have no legal impediment even when KR gets merged into Indian Railways as contemplated in the agreement dated 19.06.1990.  A declaration that the employees of KR and the KR are not governed by the provisions of the PFA is granted.  The transfer of the amounts made by KR to PFC under PFA has been made under misconception of law.  The amount standing to the credit of the KR with the PFC directed to be returned/refunded by the PFC to KR.\t\t\t\t\t         [Para 24,29,31,32]"

Secondly, the business of the earlier company was textile and the business of the petitioner company was manufacturing of stainless steel and other metal utensils. The textile factory was closed in 1982 and it was started as a manufacturing unit of stainless steel and other metal products in the year 1984. The application of the Act is co-extensive with the physical existence of the establishment. As soon as the establishment, industry or factory ceases to breathe life, the Act would automatically withdraw its application. Section 6 provides for contribution payable by the employer to the fund and the rate. It specifically gives the percentage of the basic wages for the time being payable to each of the employees. It, therefore, means that the establishment should continue to employ the employees who continue to get wages for the work done or who should be continued in employment meaning thereby, there should not be any cessation of the employer employees relationship. As soon as a workman ceases to be in employment, the liability of the employer to contribute to the fund of such workman also comes to an end. Similarly, if all the workmen cease to be in employment the liability of the employer would also come to an end. This contingency would arise when the establishment is permanently and irrevocably closed. Such liability would never revive and will have no relation back merely because the dead plant and machinery, furniture and fixture and even the licenses are purchased by a new person who starts his own business severing the past connections and contacts of the establishment which was permanently and irrevocably closed.\t\t\t [Para 9]"

In the event of any default committed in this behalf Section 14B steps in and calls upon the employer to pay damages.\n\nUnder the Directive Principles the State has the obligation for securing just and humane conditions of work which includes a living wage and decent standard of life. The Act obviously seeks to promote those goals. Therefore, interpretation of the said Act must not only be liberal but it must be informed by the values of Directive Principles. Therefore, an awareness of the social perspective of the Act must guide the interpretative process of the legislative device. An interpretation of the statute which harmonizes with its avowed object is always to be accepted than the one which dilutes it. Therefore, what is required to be done in the instant case for construing the provisions of Section 14B and 17(1A)(a) is to adopt a purposive approach, an approach which promotes the purposes of the Act.  [Para 22,26,29,37]\n\nThere is no difficulty in construing the provision of Section 17(1A)(a) where it is provided that when an exemption has been granted to an establishment under Clause (a) of sub-section (1), the provision of Sections 6, 7, 8 and 14B of the Act shall, \"so far as may be\" apply to the employer of the exempted establishment in addition to such other condition as may be specified in the notification granting such exemption. Sub-clause (a) of Section 17(1A) is divided in two parts. The second part is more specific in as much as it has been clearly stated that where an employer contravenes and makes default in compliance with any of the said conditions and provisions or any other provisions of this Act, (this would obviously include Section 14B), he shall be punishable under Section 14 as if the said section had not been exempted under clause (a). Therefore, there is a deeming provision giving clear indication of application of Section 14B of the Act to the 'employer' of an 'exempted establishment'.  [Para 43,44]\n\nThe High Court by adopting, a rather strait jacket formula in the interpretation of the expression \"so far as may be\" has misinterpreted the intent and scope and the purpose of the Act. In a case of default by the employer of an exempted establishment, in making its contribution to the Provident Fund Section 14B of the Act will be applicable.\n\n(1991) 2 SCC 495 Rel.on.\n\nAIR 1995 SC 605 Disting.

                "description": "Winding up proceedings - Claim of provident fund - Duty of liquidator - If Provident Fund is maintained by company, then liquidator cannot deny his liability to pay sums accumulated in the same - Liquidator must follow the matter with the Provident Fund Authorities and see to it that the amounts due and payable are deposited with him and ultimately paid to the workmen.\n\nAs far as Provident Fund is concerned, if that fund is maintained by the company, then the liquidator cannot deny his liability to pay sums accumulated in the same.  In other words, it is workmens' dues and it is the duty of the liquidator to move the Provident Fund authorities if the fund is transferred to them for management and administration and assist the workmen in recovery of all contributions.  The liquidator cannot leave the matter to the workmen or the applicant in this case.  Even if the Provident Fund Commissioner has not moved any application in the prescribed form, the liquidator in the facts and circumstances of this case, must follow up the matter with the Provident Fund authorities and see to it that the amounts due and payable are deposited with him and ultimately paid to the workmen. To enable the liquidator to move the Provident Fund Authorities, he is at liberty to seek such directions as are necessary from the Court.\t\t\t\t\t [Para 36,37]\n\nUnder the term \"workmen's dues\" what is covered is the sums due from a Provident Fund or the pension fund or any other fund for the welfare of the workers maintained by the company.  The sums due from this fund may be the contributions of both employer and employee, accumulated therein.  That means accumulated till the date the winding up order is passed.  The liquidator cannot be expected to make good any short fall or deficit because he is not an employer, as is understood by the applicant herein.  In other words, when the Provident Fund Act mandates creation of a fund consisting of deductions and contributions from employer-employees, it can never be the intention that a person like Liquidator is obliged to forward any contribution from the funds collected by him after disposal of the assets and properties of the company in liquidation.  As has been explained above, the argument is misconceived because if the liquidator is not the employer, then merely because he steps in after a winding-up order is made, does not mean that after he has stepped in he should go on contributing to the Provident Fund on the basis that the relationship between the company in liquidation and the employee subsists or continues in law.  The Liquidator cannot be expected to deposit any monies in such funds. He has to utilise the monies realised from sale and disposal of the assets and properties of the company in liquidation in the manner directed by company law.  It was never intended therein that he should deposit any sums in the funds. All that can be expected from the Liquidator is to assist the workmen in realising the sums due to them from the Provident Fund and that expectation will have to be fulfilled by the Liquidator.  That he fulfils such an expectation of the applicant and other employees, is something which has been achieved by court's directions issued to him. In these circumstances, the request to direct the Liquidator to make contribution of employer's share to the Provident Fund Authorities for the relevant period, cannot be granted.

Hence, it cannot be said that the amount of interest payable under Section 7-Q and damages leviable under Section 14-B do not form part of the amount due from an employer for the purpose of Section 11(2) of the Act. The expression \"any amount due from an employer\" appearing in sub-section (2) of Section 11 has to be interpreted keeping in view the object of the Act and other provisions contained therein including sub-section (1) of Section 11 and Sections 7-A, 7-Q, 14-B and 15(2) which provide for determination of the dues payable by the employer, liability of the employer to pay interest in case the payment of the amount due is delayed and also pay damages, if there is default in making contribution to the Fund. If any amount payable by the employer becomes due and the same is not paid within the stipulated time, then the employer is required to pay interest in terms of the mandate of Section 7-Q. Likewise, default on the employer's part to pay any contribution to the Fund can visit him with the consequence of levy of damages. There is no plausible reason to give a restricted meaning to the expression 'any amount due from the employer' and confine it to the amount determined under Section 7-A or the contribution payable under Section 8. If interest payable by the employer under Section 7-Q and damages leviable under Section 14 are excluded from the ambit of expression \"any amount due from an employer\", every employer will conveniently refrain from paying contribution to the Fund and other dues and resist the efforts of the concerned authorities to recover the dues as arrears of land revenue by contending that the movable or immovable property of the establishment is subject to other debts. Any such interpretation would frustrate the object of introducing the deeming provision and non obstante clause in Section 11(2).   [Para 46,47]"

The appellant has invoked clause (a) as well as clause (b) of Section 16 (1) of the Central Act. As regards the argument hinging on clause (a), it proceeds on the premise that the appellant's school (in which 16 part-time employees were working), had employed less than fifty persons and working without the aid of power. This argument, cannot come to the aid of the appellant. Inasmuch as, the appellant is running 29 schools/colleges and has employed around 1151 permanent employees. Section 2A of the Central Act predicates that where an establishment consists of different departments or has branches, whether situate in the same place or in different places, all such departments or branches shall be treated as part of the same establishment. In other words, the fact that the appellant has employed less than 50 permanent employees and who are working without the aid of power in the school in which the 16 part-time employees were also working, will not take the matter any further. Appellant has neither pleaded the material facts nor adduced any proof, so as to rebut the presumption stipulated in Section 2A of the Central Act - that all the schools and colleges run by the appellant were part of the same establishment. The fact that the appellant is a Co-operative Society registered under the State Co-operative Societies Act by itself will not extricate the appellant from the application of the Central Act.\n\n\tThe fact that the appellant is not falling within the ambit of clause (a) of Section 16(1), however, can be no impediment for the appellant to peruse the argument regarding exemption by relying on clause (b) of Section 16(1) thereof. Because, the excepted categories specified in Section 16 are mutually exclusive. They are separated by the word \"or\". Sub-clause (b) of Section 16(1) is an independent excepted category. It is attracted to any other establishment belonging to or under the control of the Central Government or a State Government \"and\" whose employees are entitled to the benefits of contributory provident fund or old age pension in accordance with any scheme or rule framed by the Central Government or the State Government governing such benefits. These twin conditions are required to be satisfied by the concerned establishment, seeking exemption from the provisions of the Central Act. In the present case, the employees working in the concerned schools/colleges of the appellant are covered by the contributory provident fund scheme framed by the State Government, subject to eligibility. The second condition required for seeking exemption under the Central Act is thus fulfilled. \t\t\t\t [Para 18,19]"

Employees thereof were entitled to the benefit of the Provident Fund.  State Government sought transfer of balance standing to its credit to the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner.  High Court in writs challenging the action held that the respondent institution is entitled to be excluded from applicability of the Central Act, 1952.  In appeal question before Supreme Court was whether 1952 Act applied to the Non-Government Educational Institutions or not and whether the respondents will fall under Section 16(1)(b).  As the State Act received Presidential assent it prevails over the Central Act in Rajasthan, Central EPF Act would not apply to the educational institutions in the State which are governed by the State Act.  Supreme Court accepted the contention that in order to be covered under the exception to Employees' Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952, following two conditions have to be satisfied by the establishment seeking to be exempted from the provisions of the Employees' Provident Fund and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952 : (i) it must be an establishment belonging to or under the control of the Central Government or a State Government and (ii) it must be an establishment whose employees are entitled to the benefit of contributory provident fund or old age pension in accordance with any scheme or rule framed by the Central Government or the State Government governing such benefits.  The provisions of the State Act of 1989 make it clear that respondent institution is a recognized educational institution managed by private management and is within the effective management of the State Government and, therefore, it is entitled to be excluded from the applicability of the Central Act, 1952.  Appeals filed by the Regional Provident Fund Commissioner dismissed and the judgment passed by the High Court affirmed.\t\t\t\t\t     [Para 12,14,28,41]"

The medical benefits so provided are from the dispensary/hospital/consulting room of such panel doctors and they are limited to such insured persons who are registered under them.  The relationship between the Corporation and such panel doctors is therefore, merely contractual without any specific term of tenure and obviously the tenure is at the pleasure of each of the parties to the contract.

Proviso appended thereto incorporates the principles of 'Natural Justice'.\t [Para 11]\n\nAn employee being required to be compulsorily insured, the employer is bound to make his part of the contribution.  An employee is also bound to make his contribution under the Act.  But the same does not mean that levy of damages in all situations would be imperative.  Section 85-B of the Act uses the words 'may recover'.  Levy of damages thereunder is by way of penalty.  The Legislature limited the jurisdiction of the authority to levy penalty, i.e., not exceeding the amount of arrears.  Regulation 31-C of the Regulations, therefore, in our opinion, must be construed keeping in view the language used in the Legislative Act and not de hors the same.   [Para 13,14]\n\nA penal provision should be construed strictly.  Only because a provision has been made for levy of penalty, the same by itself would not lead to the conclusion that penalty must be levied in all situations.  Such an intention on the part of the legislature is not decipherable from Section 85-B of the Act.  When a discretionary jurisdiction has been conferred on a statutory authority to levy penal damages by reason of an enabling provision, the same cannot be construed as imperative.  Even otherwise, an endeavour should be made to construe such penal provisions as discretionary, unless the statute is held to be mandatory in character.\t\t [Para 17]"

Explanation II of Section 2(m) of the Factories Act is inserted in the Factories Act and not in the E.S.I. Act. It marks difference in its interpretation and application. In the definition of \"factory\" under Factories Act the words \"worker working\" are used, while in the E.S.I. Act, in the section defining \"factory\", the term \"person employed for wages\" are used. A difference in these two definition of one word \"factory\" can be explained by example. A clerk or staff in the premises is not covered under the definition of \"worker\" under the Factories Act, however, under the ESI Act, the word \"worker\" is not used but the legislature chose the word \"person\" and for \"working\", the word \"employed\" is used. Thus, the premises where person is employed for a clerical work is covered under the definition \"factory\" under the E.S.I. Act. Therefore, definition of \"factory\" has wider meaning under the ESI Act than the Factories Act.\n\nIf manufacturing process is carried out as contemplated under Section 2(12) of the E.S.I. Act, then that particular unit cannot be made an exception to the application of the E.S.I. Act. To borrow the meaning from the provision of Explanation II of Section 2(m) of the Factories Act, will be a mayopic view defeating the object and spirit of the E.S.I. Act. The meaning of the term \"factory\" for the purpose of E.S.I. Act is not to be understood in the context of Explanation II of Section 2(m) of the Factories Act. This is not a harmonious construction of the Statute. Application of E.S.I. Act is not a regressive but a progressive step and to think that if E.S.I. Act is made applicable then it will affect I.T. industry adversely is a futile fear.\n2009 ALL SCR 1731 Rel. on.          [Para 19,21]"

Act shall have the meaning assigned to it u/s.2(k) of Factories Act. While reading Explanation-II of Section 2(m) of the Factories Act, the phrase \"if no manufacturing process is carried on\" is to be read necessarily in respect of the substance manufactured in the premises by any means or any method including the computer. The language of Explanation-II is to be read in a literal sense by applying rule of literal interpretation.\n\nMany verbs describing different activities are mentioned in the said definition. It is true that each activity and verb has its own connotation. The Factories Act was enacted in 1948 and at the relevant time, use of computer and software was alien to the Legislature. Naturally, the words which are more appropriate, precisely describing the activities carried out with the help of the computers i.e. development of software, programming of data, application etc. were neither known nor in practice at the relevant time when the Act was enacted. Albeit, the absence of these words, the manufacturing of the substance with the help of computers can be covered generally under the activities which are mentioned in the definition of manufacturing process as making, altering, treating, adapting etc. Thus, the Section defining manufacturing process allows a wide interpretation. This can be substantiated by giving example that some other activities like turning, milling, fitting welding, drilling, ironing, cooking, painting etc. are not specifically mentioned in the definition of manufacturing activities though these are considered as manufacturing process at various work places and covered under different 'verbs' used in the definition of manufacturing process. Therefore, though computer related activities like development, programming, application are not mentioned in the definition and to that effect there is no amendment in the section; the definition takes care of activities like development and application.

The Court also referred to Section 100 of the Factories Act and said that even under the Factories Act, 1948, the Legislature has clearly contemplated that in the cases of a factory, a company can be the \"occupier\". Therefore, when the owner of a factory is a company it is the company which is the principal employer and not its director.

                "description": "Medical negligence by ESIC doctors - Damages - Claims can be entertained by consumer forum - Such claim does not fall within scope of employees Insurance Court.\n\nCause of action for negligence arises only when damage occurs and thus the claimant has to satisfy the court on the evidence that three ingredients of negligence, namely, (a) existence of duty to take care; (b) failure to attain that standard of care; and (c) damage suffered on account of breach of duty, are present for the defendant to be held liable for negligence. Therefore, the claimant has to satisfy these ingredients before he can claim damages for medical negligence of the doctors and that could not be a question which could be adjudicated upon by the Employees' Insurance Courts which have been given specific powers of the issues, which they can adjudicate and decide. Claim for damages for negligence of the doctors or the ESI hospital/dispensary is clearly beyond the jurisdictional power of the Employees' Insurance Court. An Employees' Insurance Court has jurisdiction to decide certain claims which fall under sub-section (2) of Section 75 of the ESI Act. A bare reading of Section 75(2) also does not indicate, in any manner, that the claim for damages for negligence would fall within the purview of the decisions being made by the Employees' Insurance Court. Further, it can be seen that any claim arising out of and within the purview of the Employees' Insurance Court is expressly barred by virtue of sub-section (3) to be adjudicated upon by a civil court, but there is no such express bar for the consumer forum to exercise the jurisdiction even if the subject-matter of the claim or dispute falls within clauses (a) to (g) of sub-section (1) of Section 75 or where the jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the claim is vested with the Employees' Insurance Court under clauses (a) to (f) of sub-section (2) of Section 75 if it is a consumer's dispute falling under the Consumer Protection Act.

                "description": "Notice for dismissal/discharge etc. - Prohibition against operate only during period of illness - Such notice can become operative or valid after period of illness.\n\nReading of Section 73(2), shows that even if a notice of dismissal or discharge or reduction is given to an employee during the period of illness specified in sub-section (1), the same shall not be valid or operative. In a case where such notice is given during the said period of illness, the same shall remain in abeyance because the same is not valid nor the same can be made operative during that period. It does not mean that such a notice cannot become operative or valid after the period of illness, as specified in sub-section (1), is over. In the instant case, the sanctioned period of illness contemplated by sub-Section (1) of Section 73 is from 12.06.1986 till 01.10.1986 and the show cause notice came to be issued on 22.06.1986 i.e. during the said period of illness. The show cause notice therefore, could not become operative nor could be said to be valid during the period from 12.06.1986 till 01.10.1986. But then it is noteworthy that in case of petitioner, this show cause notice was neither made operative nor valid during the said period of illness specified by sub-Section (1) and the action to terminate services of the petitioner by dismissal order took place as late as on 19.03.1987 i.e. after the specified period.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\n\nConsequently dismissal order of the petitioner employee dated 19-03-1987 cannot be said to be void. Also, the employer filed and proved a statement of absence and attendance of the petitioner employee. Perusal of the same clearly shows that the petitioner employee  remained absent on 114 days out of 365 days in a year. From the reasons for his absence one is fully convinced that the petitioner indulged in habitual absence and the reasons furnished by him on many occasions appear to be bogus. If the petitioner could remain on leave/unauthorised absence of 114 days out of 365 days in a year, one can understand what kind of duty he must have performed. The petitioner, for all the above reasons therefore, is not entitled to any relief muchless claim for backwages."

Thus if a determination is given by the Employees Insurance Court that the concerned persons are not the employees of the petitioner, and that determination is given even without hearing the concerned persons, it will be clearly against the rules of natural justice. Section 75 of the Act does not mention who will be the parties before the Insurance Court. Since the determination by the Insurance Court is a quasi-judicial determination, natural justice requires that any party which may be adversely affected or may suffer civil consequences by such determination, must be heard before passing any order by the authority/court. Wherever any petition is filed by an employer under Section 75 of the Act, the employer has not only to implead the ESIC but has also to implead atleast some of the workers concerned (in a representative capacity if there are a large number of workers) or the trade-union representing the said workers. If that is not done, and a decision is given in favour of the employer, the same will be in violation of the rules of natural justice. After all, the real concerned parties in labour matters are the employer and the workers. The ESI Corporation will not be in any way affected if the demand notice sent by it under Section 45-A/45-B is quashed.   [Para 9,11]"

Non-payment of contributions is an economic offence and therefore the Legislature has not only fixed a minimum term of imprisonment but also a fixed amount of fine of five thousand rupees under Section 85(a)(i)(b) of the Act. There is no discretion of awarding less than the specified fee, under the main provision. It is only the proviso which is in the nature of an exception whereunder the court is vested with discretion limited to imposition of imprisonment for a lesser term. Conspicuously, no words are found in the proviso for imposing a lesser fine than that of five thousand rupees. In such a situation the intention of the Legislature is clear and brooks no interpretation. The law is well settled that when the wordings of the Stature are clear, no interpretation is required unless there is a requirement of saving the provisions from vice of unconstitutionality or absurdity. Neither of the twin situations is attracted herein.\n\tHence the question is answered in favour of the appellant and it is held that the amount of fine has to be Rupees five thousand and the courts have no discretion to reduce the same once the offence has been established. The discretion as per proviso is confined only in respect of term of imprisonment. \t [Para 8,9]"

Therefore, he cannot be prosecuted for offences under S.5(1)(d) and 5(2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act. [Para 14]\n\nThe term insurance medical officer does not mean that he must be an employee of the Corporation or there exists a master servant or command - obedience relationship.  The panel doctors are appointed by way of a contract signed between the Corporation and such private practitioners and they are responsible to provide medical treatment to the insured persons (as well as to the families) who are registered with them and for such medical service rendered by them, they submit the bills which are reimbursable by the Corporation as per the rates stipulated or agreed upon.  The medical benefits so provided are from the dispensary/hospital/consulting room of such panel doctors and they are limited to such insured persons who are registered under them.  The relationship between the Corporation and such panel doctors is therefore, merely contractual without any specific term of tenure and obviously the tenure is at the pleasure of each of the parties to the contract.  [Para 10]\n\nTo perform a public duty, one must occupy a public office or must be in the employment of the State or a Corporation established by the Government either under a Central or a State Act.  A perusal of the contract signed between the Corporation and the panel doctor in pursuance of the enabling powers U/s 59(2) of the Act, indicates that there is nothing to show that a panel doctor is an employee of the Corporation and therefore, the contentions that such a panel doctor performs a public duty by way of providing medical benefits to the insured persons or to their families as the case may be, cannot be sustained.\t\t\t\t [Para 11]"

The business and work of one unit was not independent of the others. The ESI Act is applicable to all factories. The work \"factory\" has been defined under the said Act in section 2(12) as meaning the premises including the precincts thereof wherein 10 or more persons were employed on wages in the preceding 12 months and in which a manufacturing process is being carried out with the aid of power or where 20 persons are employed in a manufacturing process, without the aid of power.  Under section 2(14-AA), 'manufacturing process' is assigned the same meaning as manufacturing process under the Factories Act. There is no doubt that the five units which are situated either in the same premises or in the precincts of the premises are involved in manufacturing process and therefore, the ESI Act is applicable as the number of employees working in each of the five units was between 5 and 7.

This limit was reduced to 10 when the process was carried out with the aid of power. Obviously, since use of power reduces the need of work force. The object is to ensure that an establishment does not escape from the applicability of benevolent provisions of these statutes by using power to mechanize processes and reduce work force.  Thus if power has been used for performing a task for which labour would have otherwise been required, then such a process aided by power would be relevant. No amount of manpower is likely to achieve preserving articles by cooling them, which a freezer does, or cooling bottles for which a bottle cooler is used. Therefore, use of these gadgets does not bring the establishment within the ambit of Employee's State Insurance Act, so long as it employs less than 20 persons.\tMoreover, provisions of the Act are made applicable to factories employing 20 persons or even 10 persons when manufacturing process is aided by power. Thus, it is only when power replaces manpower that reduced strength of persons employed also attracts the provisions of the Act.\t\t [Para 9,11]"

The expression 'supervision of the principal employer' under Section 2(9) means something more than mere exercise of some remote or indirect control over the activities or the work of the workers. A direct disciplinary control by the principal employer over the workers engaged by the contractors may also be covered by the expression 'supervision of the principal employer'. The circumstances, as in the case of HCMPSU Ltd., that the authorized representatives of the principal employer are entitled to travel in the vehicle of the contractor free of charge or in the case of BURDCMPS Union, that the principal employer has right to ask for removal of such workers who misbehave with their staff are not the circumstances which may even remotely suggest the control or interference exercised by the appellants over the workers engaged by the contractor for transportation of milk. From the agreements entered into by the appellants with the contractors, it does not transpire that the appellants have arrogated to themselves any supervisory control over the workers employed by the contractors. The said workers were under the direct control of the contractor. Exercise of supervision and issue of some direction by the principal employer over the activities of the contractor and his employees is inevitable in contracts of this nature and that by itself is not sufficient to make the principal employer liable. That the contractor is not an agent of the principal employer under Section 2(9)(ii) admits of no ambiguity. No evidence has been collected by the E.S.I. Corporation during the inspection of the appellants' establishments or from the contractors that the appellants have any say over the terms and conditions of employment of these employees or that the appellants have any thing to do with logistic operations of the contractors. As a matter of fact, there is nothing on record to show that principal employer had any knowledge about the number of persons engaged by the contractors or the names or the other details of such persons. There is also no evidence that the appellants were aware of the amount payable to each of these workers. In the circumstances, even if it be held that the transportation of milk is incidental to the purpose of factory or establishment, for want of any supervision of the appellants on the work of such employees, these employees are not covered by the definition of 'employee' under Section 2(9) of the Act.

Thus, \"adapt\" would not mean using the thing or article as it is.  To adapt means to make an article suitable by remodeling so as to conform to a situation or an environment.  Even according to the Concise Law Dictionary \"To Adapt\" means to make suitable, to alter as to fit for a new use, to change by adaptation, etc.  Thus, it cannot be said by any stretch of imagination that the word \"adapt\" means that the thing or article is itself fit and suitable.  As can be seen from the Dictionary meaning, something more has to be done to the article by adopting it.  In fact, adaptation would mean a process of modifying a thing so as to suit a new condition.  Thus, the use of air conditioner could have been said to be covered under the definition of the word \"manufacturing process\" only if some alternations were done to the air conditioner or the air conditioner was modified to make it suitable for some new use.  Mere use of sir conditioners in the lodging rooms for the comfort of the customers would not be sufficient to hold that the employer Hotel was carrying on \"manufacturing process\" within the meaning of Section 2(k) of the Factories Act.  Since it is not the case of the Corporation that any other process mentioned in Section 2(k)(i) of the Factories Act was experienced by or carried on, on the air conditioner with a view to its use, it cannot be said that the Corporation was justified in passing the order under Section 45-A of the Act as the only term applicable in the instant case, according to the Corporation was \"adapting\" and as already pointed out herein above, the word 'adapting' could not be applied to the facts of this case as the air conditioner was not 'adapted' for its use in the hotel room.  1995(II) CLR 70 & 1987 Lab.I.C. 1197 - Dist.\t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 11]"

Proviso appended thereto incorporates the principles of 'Natural Justice'.\t [Para 11]\n\nAn employee being required to be compulsorily insured, the employer is bound to make his part of the contribution.  An employee is also bound to make his contribution under the Act.  But the same does not mean that levy of damages in all situations would be imperative.  Section 85-B of the Act uses the words 'may recover'.  Levy of damages thereunder is by way of penalty.  The Legislature limited the jurisdiction of the authority to levy penalty, i.e., not exceeding the amount of arrears.  Regulation 31-C of the Regulations, therefore, in our opinion, must be construed keeping in view the language used in the Legislative Act and not de hors the same.   [Para 13,14]\n\nA penal provision should be construed strictly.  Only because a provision has been made for levy of penalty, the same by itself would not lead to the conclusion that penalty must be levied in all situations.  Such an intention on the part of the legislature is not decipherable from Section 85-B of the Act.  When a discretionary jurisdiction has been conferred on a statutory authority to levy penal damages by reason of an enabling provision, the same cannot be construed as imperative.  Even otherwise, an endeavour should be made to construe such penal provisions as discretionary, unless the statute is held to be mandatory in character.\t\t [Para 17]"

[Para 10]\n\nIn the present case the evidence shows that the sweepers/the cleaners, and the liftmen are engaged by M/s Liberty Cinema who are either the owners or the landlords of a multistoreyed building, on a portion of the 4th floor of which the Respondent has its establishment in a tenanted premises. The part-time employees such as the sweepers/the cleaners, and the liftmen of the building were common for all the tenants. They were being paid by M/s Liberty Cinema, the owners of the building. May be by way of tips or gratuitous payments the Respondent might be paying those staff members some regular amounts against vouchers. Those amounts are very meagre. To the liftmen, the Respondent paid Rs.25/- per month and to the sweeper/cleaner the Respondent paid Rs.80/- per month. On this evidence it would be just not possible to find that the Respondent has a power of selection of the sweeper/th cleaner, or the liftman. The Respondent also could not be said to have a right to control the method by which the sweepers/the cleaners and the liftmen would do their work and certainly by no stretch of logic it could be said that the Respondent has a right of suspension or dismissal over the sweepers/the cleaners and the liftmen. Out of the four indicia at least three are not satisfied in this case. So far as the Respondent is concerned, the sweepers/the cleaners and the liftmen cannot be said to be the employees within the meaning of that word as defined in Section 2(9) of the Act.  [Para 11]"

                "description": "Clubbing two units - Firm converted into Private Ltd. Co. which came to be registered in June 1962 - Clubbing appellant, a proprietary concern, with Private Ltd. Co. from 18th April 1959 - On facts, held, order was unsustainable.\n\nIn the instant case, the court below has quite properly borne in mind the tests for deciding whether the two units form part of but one establishment and, the view expressed by the court below about justification being there for clubbing the Appellant a proprietary concern of with the Private Limited Co. is unexceptionable.  [Para 24]\n\nThe contention on behalf of the appellant that the Respondent has passed orders about clubbing of the Private Limited Co. and the Appellant with effect from 18th April 1959 while M/s Modern Textile Rayon and Silk Mills Pvt. Ltd. as a Private Limited Co. came to be registered in June 1962 and therefore no orders clubbing the Private Limited Co. with the Appellant could be passed effective from 18th April 1959 cannot be accepted. True, M/s. Modern Textile Rayon and Silk Mills Pvt. Ltd. came to be incorporated as the Private Limited Co. in June 1962.  But prior thereto there was a partnership firm in the name of Modern Textiles of which Mr.A.C.Shah was the partner right from the beginning and the Private Limited Co. took over that firm (Modern Textiles) as a going concern.  Therefore whether it was Modern Textiles, a firm or whether it was M/s Modern Textile Rayon and Silk Mills Pvt. Ltd., a Private Limited Co, the existence of that unit or that establishment or that body admittedly is there since prior to 18th April 1959 in one form or the other.  True, under law a company is distinct from its members or directors.  A company is distinct from a firm which it has taken over as a going concern.  Nonetheless in the present case we are only concerned with the invocation of the principle of clubbing for the purpose of covering the Appellant under the provisions of the Act.   For that purpose, only the number of employees working with the Private Limited Co. or the erstwhile firm M/s Modern Fabrics would be the relevant factor and that number of employees would not in any manner be affected merely by the firm m/s Modern Fabrics getting converted into the Private Limited Co.  Therefore there is no warrant for saying that the Appellant could not have been clubbed with the Private Limited Co. from 18th April 1959 though of course the Private Limited Co. came into existence as a company only in June 1962.  Prior to 1962 there existed a firm M/s Modern Fabrics, of which Mr.A.C.Shah was admittedly a partner.  In Private Limited Co. Mr.A.C.Shah is the Managing Director.  Under these circumstances, the argument on behalf of the Appellant that in any view of the matter the Appellant could not have been clubbed with the Private Limited Co. with effect from 18th April 1959 is required to be rejected.

It is not possible to reappreciate the evidence on record in order to record a finding of facts, even if it is assumed for the sake of argument that the trial Court was wrong in appreciating the evidence on record, that cannot amount to any question of law and far less a substantial question of law to sustain this appeal under 82(2) of the Act.  Since involvement of any substantial question of law has not been demonstrated in the appeal, it is liable to be dismissed on this ground alone.

However, the letter calling upon the Appellant to get it registered under the provisions of the Act with effect from 1st April 1962 was addressed on 4th June, 1975.  The Appellant had informed the Respondent that the said three units could not be clubbed together to constitute one factory within the meaning of 2(12) of the Act.  Thereafter, the letters were issued to recover particular amount of contribution from the Appellant in respect of the period from 1st April 1972 to 30th June 1973 and from 1st July 1973 to 31st December 1974.  In the facts of the case, it is not possible to hold that there was gross delay on the part of the Respondent in raising the demand upon the Appellant.  Though reliance was placed on the case of KT Rolling Mills Pvt.Ltd. decided by this Court wherein it has been held that the proceedings under Section 14B Employees' Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act 1952 initiated in 1986 in respect of delay in payment of contributions for the period commencing from July 1968 to October 1977 were liable to be quashed on the ground of delay even though the Act was a social welfare legislation, the Supreme Court has reversed the said decision of this Court.  As held by the Supreme Court there can be no dispute in law that when a power is conferred by statute without mentioning the period within which it could be invoked, the same has to be done within reasonable period, as all powers must be exercised reasonably and the exercise of the same within reasonable period would be fact of reasonableness.  However, the facts stated hereinabove go to show that there was no gross delay on the part of the Respondent in exercise of power in demanding contribution from the Appellant.\n\nAIR 1995 SC 943 and 1993 Mah L.J. 947 Referred.

To construe that an order passed by the EI Court which suffers from such serious infirmity of perversity and pulpable absence of evidence is not an appealable order, would create havoc to say the least.  Such an order would certainly affect the basic rights of the parties to get a decision on the basis of the evidence adduced by them before the court and it is the fundamental duty of any adjudicating court to consider such evidence and record its findings after giving cogent reasons for its decision or conclusion.  If such adjudicating authority fails to record reasons in its order for its conclusions it would certainly be a perverse order.  If such an adjudicating authority has no evidence of any nature at all and still it records a finding one way or the other which is not supported by any evidence, it would also be a perverse order and can be challenged in an appeal on the ground of substantial question of law.  A finding contrary to the evidence or material on record would also be perverse.

The authority's impugned order can not be sustained as the authority did not give an opportunity of hearing to the Appellant in regard to names and other particulars of the contractors. High Court order set aside.   [Para 3,19]"

This was after due deliberations so as to provide all benefits to all types of workers/ employees as contemplated under the Insurance Act. The extension is by Circular dated 31/07/2015 by referring to the Notification dated 21st June, 1977 under Section 1(5) of Insurance Act whereby several establishments and factories were covered. So there is notification containing exemption clause whereby certain establishments have been excluded/ exempted from the purview of the Act. The clarification, so issued, in the year 1999 was definitely kept in mind and in view of the subsequent development and requirement, based upon the decision so taken and in view of the recommendations received from various sources, the Authorities have taken decision by following due procedure and unanimously ratified the decision of coverage of the ESI Scheme to the construction workers, in any way, cannot be stated to be beyond the scope, purpose and powers of the Insurance Act, Rules, Regulations and the Scheme made thereunder. \n\n\tMerely because, earlier in the year 1999 the exemption was made and not extended by the Insurance Act to such workers, the policy decision was taken by the Government based upon the material and the prevailing situation, it needs no interference. No validity of any clause and/or the provisions are challenged by the Petitioners and even, otherwise, considering the Scheme and the purpose of the Insurance Act, we see that the Insurance Act, in no way, can be stated to be against the employers and/or it is only in favour of the employees. Both will be benefit if the Act is extended for the various purposes, as contemplated under the Insurance Act. There is no illegality and/or issue in extending the provisions to the employees/workers, being a welfare legislation.\t [Para 11,12]"

Merely because the members of association have been registered under the BOCW Act and so also the site workers are required to make application for registration, that itself is not a sufficient reason to deny the extension of Insurance Act to such workers/employees. The purpose and object of both the Acts is different, so also the respective schemes. The requirement to have workers insurance scheme under the BOCW Act itself means both the Acts are different on various aspects and are not in conflict with each other. The conflict and/or benefit, even if are available under one Act, it is settled that the employees/workers are not entitled to two parallel and similar benefits. In our view, there is no conflict.\n\n\tSimilarly, the Building and Other Construction Workers' Welfare Cess Act, 1996 (\"BOCWWC Act\") has again different aims and object to achieve. Merely because the members of association have been paying such cess at 1% since 1996 and have contributed a huge amount to the State exchequer by way of cess payments that by itself cannot be a reason to deny the benefits of the Insurance Act to the construction employees/workers. The BOCWW Act provides for the levy and collection of a cess on the cost of construction incurred by employers with a view to augment the resources of the Building and Other Construction Workers' Welfare Boards constituted under the BOCW Act. The submission, therefore, that the existence of these Acts is sufficient to achieve the aims, objects and purpose of the Insurance Act is also unacceptable and we decline to accept the submission that the nature of the benefits provided under the Insurance Act is also provided under the BOCW Act and the BOCWWC Act.\t [Para 12,13]"

It has been enacted to protect and safeguard the rights of the working class. Its preamble states that it is meant to \"provide for certain benefits to employees in case of sickness, maternity and 'employment injury' and to make provision for certain other matters in relation thereto\". The Employees' State Insurance Fund set up under this Act survives primarily on contributions paid to the Employees' State Insurance Corporation. All employees insured in accordance with this Act are entitled to benefits under the Act. Undoubtedly, the literal meaning of statutory provisions cannot be ignored. However, in cases where there may be two or more ways to interpret a statutory provision, the spirit of this legislation warrants a construction that benefits the working class. The inclusive part and exclusive portion of the definition of \"wages\" clearly indicate that the expression \"wages\" has been given wider meaning. Under the definition, firstly whatever remuneration is paid or payable to an employee under the terms of the contract of the employment, expressed or implied, is \"wages\". Secondly, whatever payment is made to an employee in respect of any period of authorized leave, lock-out etc. is \"wages\". Thirdly, other additional remuneration, if any, paid at intervals not exceeding two months is also \"wages\". Any ambiguous expression should be given a beneficent construction in favour of employees by the Court. If the definition of \"wages\" is read in its entirety including the inclusive part as well as the exclusive portion, it appears that inclusive portion is not intended to be limited only of items mentioned therein, particularly, having regard to the objects and reasons for which the Employees' State Insurance Act is enacted. The Act has to be necessarily so construed as to serve its purpose and objects. (2000) 3 SCC 185, (1984) 4 SCC 324 Ref. to. \t\t [Para 8]"

The power to impose damages is discretionary.  The section does not empower the authority to recover minimum amount of damages from the defaultating employer.  The intention of the legislature seems to have been that in deserving cases considering the plea set up by the defaulting employers, authority can dispense with in its totality, the amount of damages or scale it down considering the fact-situation of the case.  The power to levy and recover the damages provided under Section 85(B) of the Act is in the nature of penal provision.  The proviso of section 85(B) does indicate that before recovering such damages the employer should be given reasonable opportunity of being heard and the adjudication in the matter is contemplated.  Since the failure to carry out this statutory obligation is provided with the adjudicatory forum and the levy of damages is penal in character.  Such damages shall not ordinarily be imposed unless the defaulting employer acted intentionally or in defiance of law or guilty of dishonest conduct or acted in conscious disregard of its obligation.  The circumstances, if are beyond the control of defaulting employer it shall have to be given due consideration by the authority.  On mere failure of the defaulting employer, Corporation is not empowered to recover damages mechanically without taking into account the facts and circumstances of each case.  While levying the damages by resorting to section 85(B), the authority has to record the finding, that the due opportunity was given to the defaulting employer and after considering mitigating circumstances putforth by the defaulting employer the order is passed.  The deduction of the contribution from the wages of the employees, cannot be a sole ground to punish the employers with maximum levy of damages.  The proviso which is appended to section 85(B), mandates an opportunity of hearing to the erring employers.  If the scheme of section 85(B) in its entirety is taken into consideration, the damages seem to be in penal nature.  Section contemplates levy of damages by the authority under the provisions of the said Act, 1948 after hearing the employer.  The question of payment of contribution as well as payment of interest in accordance with the scheme of the said Act, 1948 and the Employees' State Insurance (General) Regulations, 1950 has no relevance so far as to levy of damages is concerned.  However, equally it is important that the authority i.e. Regional Director has to apply his mind while dealing with the alleged mitigating circumstances and/or ground raised by the erring employer.  The nature of damages being penal, the authority is armed with the powers to levy the damages and/or waive the damages.  [Para 13,14]"

The exemption granted from the operation of the ESI Act is one kind of endeavour of the State Government to give helping hand to the appellants.

It is also a social welfare legislation. In keeping with such intention of the Government while issuing notification in question, held, that mere reference in the Government Notification that it would be applicable to the appellant No.1, with reference to the address given of the Head Office, would not disentitle the appellant No.2 from claiming such exemption.

The object of adding third proviso to S. 30(1), is to ensure the compliance of the award passed by the Commissioner for Employee\u2019s Compensation in the event of dismissal of the Appeal filed by the employer, so that the employee is not required to run from pillar to post for getting the amount of compensation for years together. The literal interpretation of the term \u2018Employer\u2019 as suggested by learned Counsel for the Appellant is bound to lead to an anamolous situation, where though the employer is required to deposit the amount of compensation before filing an appeal against the award and file certificate of deposit along with memorandum of Appeal, but the Insurer, if chooses to file an Appeal against the same award becoming liable to pay the compensation on account of a contract of insurance between the employer and the Insurer, can file Appeal without depositing the amount of compensation and without certificate of deposit. This could never be the intention of the Legislature while adding third proviso to S. 30(1), of the Act of 1923. Consequently, it is held that the third proviso to S. 30(1) of the Act of 1923 requiring the Employer to accompany certificate of deposit from the Commissioner for Employee\u2019s Compensation of the amount of compensation along with the memorandum of Appeal is equally applicable to the Appeal filed by the Insurer, and the Appeal at the behest of the Insurer without such a certificate would not be maintainable.\n(Paras 7, 8, 17, 19, 20)"

                "description": "Sale of enemy property - Power of Custodian u/S.8 cannot override the power of Central Govt. u/S.6 - The sections have to be read together and harmoniously so as to subserve and uphold the legislative intent.\n\n\tWhile it is true that a transfer of property vesting in the Custodian by enemy or enemy subject of enemy firm is contemplated by section 6, a power equally is given to the Central Government to declare such transfer to be void if such transfer by an enemy or enemy subject or enemy firm is injurious to the public interest or so made with a view to evade or defeat the vesting of the property in the Custodian. Thus, being an enemy, the right to transfer the property could be exercised subject to this provision. This provision gives a power to the Central Government to declare the transfer to be void and thereupon it shall continue to vest or deemed to be vested in the Custodian. In the present case, it is this power which is exercised by the Central Government.\t [Para 40]\n\n\tThe power of the Custodian under section 8 is therefore not such as would enable the Custodian to override the said Act. It is a discretion given to the Custodian to take or authorise to take all such measures for preserving such property and where the property belongs to an individual enemy subject, the Custodian may incur expenditure out of the property as is necessary or expedient for the maintenance of that individual or his family in India. This would also reinforce the conclusion that the enemy is not to be deprived of his right, title and interest in the property. If the enemy subject is an individual, he may also be in a position to provide for his family members in India through such measures as are devised by the Custodian. Therefore, vesting of the property in the Custodian is limited to the extent of possession, management and control over the property. It is towards that end that he has been conferred with such powers as would enable him to take suitable actions including transfer by way of sale, mortgage or lease or otherwise dispose of any of the properties of the enemy subject. This would apply in the case of the enemy subject holding more than one property. We do not see any conflict therefore in section 7(3) and section 8 of the said Act. By sub section (3) of section 7, the Custodian is mandated to deal with any money paid to him under the Defence of India Rules, 1962 or the Defence of India Rules, 1971 or under this Act or any property vested in him under this Act in such manner as the Central Government may direct. Therefore, the power is conferred in the Central Government and it is empowered to direct the Custodian to deal with the money and any property of the enemy subject in such manner as the Central Government deems fit and proper. When such direction is issued, then, the Custodian is bound to comply with it. That power under sub section (3) of section 7 is in the Central Government and it can direct the Custodian to act in terms thereof. Else, the Custodian is free to exercise his powers in respect of enemy property vested in him vide section 8. However, the powers of the Custodian under section 8 are to be exercised keeping in mind the intent of preserving the same. \t\t [Para 41]\n\n\tThe sections have to be read together and harmoniously so as to subserve and uphold the legislative intent. The legislative intent being clear, the words appearing in the section will have to be given their plain and natural meaning as held above. There is nothing vague in the expression and words appearing in section 6 of the Act. It is therefore transfer of property vesting in the Custodian by enemy or enemy subject or enemy firm may be permissible. He holds all rights, title and interest in the enemy property. The transfer can be declared to be void if it is injurious to public interest or made with a view as in this case. Such a provision has been inserted advisedly. The \"enemy\" is defined to mean a person or country who or which was an enemy, enemy subject or enemy firm as the case may be under the Defence of India Act but does not include a citizen of India. Once the person therefore is termed as an enemy, then, his property in Indiacannot be freely dealt with by him on par with an Indian citizen. TheIndian citizen is excluded from the term \"enemy\" or \"enemy subject\". Once the definition of the terms \"enemy\" or \"enemy subject\" or \"enemy firm\" are read in their proper perspective, it would be clear that the property for the time being belonging to or held or managed on behalf of an enemy vests in the Custodian. The property continues to be termed as an enemy property even when an individual enemy subject dies in the territory to which the Enemy Property Act extends. Therefore, the placement of section 6 of the said Act and reading it along with other sections which follow the same would throw light on the intention of the legislature. The powers of the Custodian in respect of the enemy property vested in him are to be exercised for taking such measures as he considers necessary or expedient for preserving such property and when such property belongs to an individual enemy, the Custodian may incur expenditure out of the property as he considers expedient for the maintenance of that individual or of his family in India. Thus, these powers are also to be exercised consistent with the aim and object that the Act seeks to achieve. The Act does not wish to deprive the enemy or enemy subject of his right, title and interest in the properties and therefore assists him by vesting the property in the Custodian to be appointed under the Act. The Custodian holds the property upon its vesting in him for preservation. He also is permitted to incur certain expenditure, if the property is held by an individual enemy subject, from such property for the maintenance of the individual enemy subject or his family members in India. The provisions like section 8 enable the Custodian to take measures as he considers necessary or expedient for preserving the property. It is therefore that he is conferred with several powers. Thus, the intent is to manage and administer the property by taking the afore-contemplated measures. By section 9 to 15, it would be apparent as to how when the property vests in the Custodian it is exempt from attachment etc. When persons are dealing with the Custodian while he exercises the powers conferred by section 8, those persons also have certain protection and that is apparent from the above referred sections. The Custodian is thus not free to dispose of the property as per his whims and fancies. He must deal with the property of the enemy subject consistent with the powers of preservation conferred in him. The legislature while using the words \"preserving such property\" is conscious that nothing should be done by which the enemy subject deals with the property situated in India as if he is an Indian citizen. His right and freedom to hold the property even if it is in India is intact but subject to the Custodian's intervention. It is to ensure that the enemy's rights qua his property are not jeopardised nor the enemy is deprived of the same. Equally, the Custodian should not allow the enemy subject to deal with his property in any manner and contrary to the Act itself.\n\n\tFurther, it is the Central Government alone which is conferred with the power to divest the enemy property vested in the Custodian. By section 18, it is the Central Government which is empowered to direct that any enemy property vesting in the Custodian under this Act and remaining with him shall be divested from him and to return in such manner as may be prescribed to the owner thereof or to such other person as may be specified in the direction and thereupon such property shall cease to vest in the Custodian and shall re-vest in the owner or other person. This provision reinforces above conclusion that any enemy property vested in the Custodian under this Act and remaining with him shall be divested from him only by the Central Government and none else. \t\t\t\t [Para 60]"

[Para 8,11]\n\nThe provision for payment of disability pension is a beneficial provision which ought to be interpreted liberally so as to benefit those who have been sent home with a disability at times even before they completed their tenure in the armed forces.

                "description": "Notification dt. 19-2-1991 (As substituted in 1997 in respect of CRZ No. II) - Word \"existing\" repeatedly occuring therein - Meaning of - It carries the same meaning viz existing as on the date of the notification.\n\nThe word \"existing\" as used in the concerned part of the Notification, cannot be read differently at different places within the same part. The word \"existing\" used in the material part of the Notification refers in several places to structures which were already physically existing on the date of the Notification and to roads exiting already on the date of the Notification. The use of participle 'existing' to qualify \"local Town and Country Planning Regulations\" and \"Norms of Floor Space Index/Floor Area ratio\" is, not merely accidental. It serves an important purpose, namely, to highlight that irrespective of what local Town and Country Planning Regulations may provide for in future in any nook or corner of the country, and irrespective of how the norms of Floor space Index/Floor Space Ratio might be revised at some future point of time, the building activity permitted under the Notification in CRZ-II shall be frozen to the laws and norms existing on the date of the Notification. This interpretation, is perfectly in consonance with the legislative intention behind the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.  [Para 70]\n\nProgress is reflected in change and no frozen action, contend the Petitioners' Counsel. But, progress is a concept with deeper philosophical, ethical and moral overtones. One man's meat may be another's poison. So with progress too. Ultimately, it is for the collective will of the people, as expressed by law, to asset itself and answer this question. Whether depredation of environment is progress or regress is a matter of collective wisdom reflected in legislative policy. If Parliament intended that there shall be no \"progress\" of such type in future, one cannot demur or protest, at least in a Court of law.  [Para 71]\n\nWhat the notification intends is that the F.S.I. norms be pegged at the level at which they existed in February 1991. This was the extent to which the coastal area had already been built upon. If, therefore, even in future, notwithstanding reduction of the F.S.I. norms elsewhere, the CRZ-II zone  is given this benefit, we see nothing wrong or objectionable therein, nor any reason against such construction being adopted.  [Para 72]\n\nFurther, by virtue of the provisions of Section 21 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986, the provisions of the Act, the rules or orders made therein shall take effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith contained in any enactment other than the Act. Thus, whatever be the Heritage TDR Regulation No. 67, brought into force in the year 1995, it can have no application in the areas falling within CRZ-II.  [Para 73]"

Constitution of India, Art.226.\n\nClause (iii) of CRZ-III deals with construction/reconstruction of dwelling units between 200 metres to 500 metres. Considering the aforesaid provision of the Regulations, the construction of jetty falls within the \"permissible activities\" and such a permissible activity is permitted in CRZ-III, however, subject to other requirements i.e. taking permission from the MOEF. In the instant case, respondent No.1 has now already taken such a permission and considering the said aspect, it is not possible to accept the submission of Mr. Subramanian that there is a total prohibition on construction of jetty in CRZ-III as the area upto 200 metres is to be considered as No Development Zone. As pointed out earlier, even under the No Development Zone, there are certain activities which are permissible. Even construction of schools, community toilets are also permissible and as argued by Mr. Fereira, learned Assist. Solicitor General construction of a jetty is definitely a permissible activity, as in different parts of the Country such constructions are permissible in CRZ-III even within the No Development Zone. It is true, even if two views are possible, the one in favour of environment has to be accepted. It cannot be said that two views are possible on reading of the Notification. As per the notification, the construction of the jetty, as pointed out earlier, is a permissible activity and on reading of the entire notification and the clarification thereof, it cannot be said that even construction of permissible activity cannot be carried out in CRZ-III, in an area upto 200 metres from the HTL which is earmarked as No Development Zone.

XX C ; S.269 UA ; Constitution of India Art. 226.\n\nThe Land's End Bandra is a peninsular piece of Land which juts into the sea, being covered on the East, North and West by the Sea. The land was exempted under the Urban Land Ceiling Act. There has been considerable development on this peninsular piece of land and a developed road runs North-South almost to the tip of the peninsular area. Towards the West seaward of this road, there exists a five star hotel, \"Sea Rock\", whose construction had been permitted much before the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 was brought into force. Hotel Sea Rock is situated towards the North of the Bandra fort within about 100 meters therefrom. A plot of land measuring 45,000 square yards situated opposite the Hotel Sea Rock i.e. towards the Eastern side of the developed road is the subject matter of this Writ Petition. Towards the East of this plot the hill slopes down to the Mahim Bay and there is a large tract of open land which now has been encroached upon and dotted by numerous unauthorised structures, though continued to be shown as green area in the sanctioned and revised Development Plan for H-West Ward of Mumbai. The construction of the hotel Sea Rock has been challenged by a writ petition by way of public Interest Litigation by number of petitioners. The construction was challenged on the grounds as below :\n\n(a) Violation of Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Rules.\n\n(b) Contravention of Urban Land Ceiling Act and the exemption order made thereunder.\n\n(c) Contravention of the provisions of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966.\n\n(d) Violation of the sanctioned Development Plan.\n\n(e) Challenge to the decision of the Ministry of Environment & Forest, Government of India. \n\n(f) Challenge to the Corrigendum Notification dated 22nd November 1966.\n\n(g) Challenge to sanctioned Development Plan.\n\n(h) Challenge to permission granted by the State Pollution Control Board.\n\n(i) Contravention of the provisions of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 and Development Control Regulations for Greater Bombay, 1991.\n\n(j) Contravention of the Development Control Regulation No. 59.\n\n(k) Amalgamation of sixth and ninth Respondents, fraudulent, illegal and intended to circumvent law.\n\n(l) Application of Chapter XX-C of the Income Tax Act, 1961.\n\nHeld, that the Construction of the Hotel Sea Rock was valid and there was no contravention of any of the provisions of statutes or statutory rules or notifications under the Statutes.  [Para 17]\n\nBasically, the Coastal Regulation Zone is one which falls within 500 meters of the High Tide Line. Merely because the Bandra Fort is situated at the tip of the peninsular plot of land, the entire peninsular plot of land does not fall within CRZ-I. The restrictions against construction in CRZ-I would apply only to a stretch of 500 meters from the High Tide Line as long as that area falls within the area declared as heritage monument under the Maharashtra Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Act. Looking at the revised dimensions in the Notification of 31st July 1998, it is not possible to accept the contention that the concerned plot would fall within CRZ-I area so as to completely prohibit constructional activity on it.  [Para 33,34]\n\nThe expression industry used in Para 2(i) of the CRZ Notification dt. 19-2-1991 must take colour from the concept of environmental pollution such as Trade effluents which are discharged by the industry which would otherwise require permission from the Pollution Control Board. A careful scrutiny of the different types of activities prohibited under the different clauses of paragraph 2 of the Notification supports this view. In fact, construction of hotels is permitted in CRZ-II and CRZ-III as evidenced from paragraph 7 of the said Notification. Hence, it could not be contended that the hotel is an \"industry\" and as such construction of the hotel on the concerned plot is prohibited under paragraph 2 of the CRZ Notification.  [Para 35]\n\nThe contention that Sub. cls. (v) (vii) (viii) (ix) (xii) and (xiii) are violated by the construction of hotel \"Sea Rock\" cannot be accepted. What is prohibited by sub-clause (v) of Clause 2 of the 1991 CRZ Notification is \"discharge of untreated wastes and effluents from industries, cities or towns and other human settlements\" within the coastal regulation zone. There is no material on record to show that the hotel constructed by the Respondents discharges untreated wastes and effluents into the sea. As to the grievance against the Bombay Municipal Corporation Sewerage purification Plant, the grievance has no substance since the Bombay Municipal Corporation Sewerage Purification Plant is intended to treat city wastes and effluents and render them innocuous before being discharged into the Sea. Hence there is no violation of sub-clause (v) of Clause 2 of 1991 CRZ Notification.  Sub-clauses (viii) and (xii) of Clause 2 of the Notification are intended to permit land reclamation for limited purposes and to permit construction activity between Low Tide Line and High Tide Line for carrying of treated effluents and wastes water discharges into the sea. The Bombay Municipal Corporation Sewerage Purification Plant and the proposed pipeline fall within the activity permitted by these clauses. In fact, by the Notification dated 9th July 1997, sub-clause (viii) has been completely substituted and the activity of construction of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Sewerage Purification Plant is wholly permitted thereunder. Further sub-clause (ix) of Clause 2 of the CRZ Notification has no application at all. Sub-clause (xiii) of Clause 2 of the 1991 CRZ Notification cannot be said to be violated if what is done is permissible construction activity and anything that is reasonably necessary to carry out the permissible activity or construction of a building without violation of any of the provisions of the CRZ Notification.  Sub-clause (xiii) cannot be read in isolation and has to be read subject to the regulation of permissible activities under sub-clause (iii). That is why sub-clause (xiii) of Clause 2 of the Notification uses the expression \"except as permissible under the Notification\". If the construction activity is permitted under any other part of the Notification, then the prohibition contemplated by Clause 2, sub-clause (xiii) is not attracted.  [Para 38,39,40]\n\nIt could not be contended that the exemption granted under the Urban Land Ceiling Act (ULCA) was violated by the respondents. One of the conditions of the order dated 25th July 1978 made under Section 20 of ULCA granting exemption specifically stipulated was that \"no transfer by way of sale, mortgage, gift, lease or otherwise\" shall be made of the exempted land and that in case of violation of this condition, the exemption order was liable to be revoked. There was also a condition that the sixth Respondent was to give an area of 7000 square yards free of cost to the Bombay Municipal Corporation for being maintained as a public park. There was no violation of the conditions. Under Section 19 of ULCA read with section 5 of the Banking Regulation Act, and Section 591 of the Companies Act, Citibank is one of the entities in whose favour the land, even though exempted under section 20 of the ULCA, could have been mortgaged. The contention that the mortgage of the land to Citibank to raise finances is in violation of ULCA is, therefore, without substance and untenable. Further, there was an express order made by the Government of Maharashtra on 7th February 1980 issuing a no objection certificate for transfer of the exempted vacant land to the ninth Respondent on amalgamation with the sixth Respondent subject to certain conditions as to shareholding. By the order of the Company Court the Scheme of Amalgamation of the sixth and the ninth Respondents was sanctioned with effect from 1st August 1992. Consequently, upon the amalgamation scheme coming into operation, the undertaking of the sixth Respondent including all assets and liabilities stood vested in the ninth Respondent. Even after amalgamation, the shareholding continues to be in the same ratio as it was before. Hence there was no contravention of any condition. This issue also could not be reagitated since those pleas were repeated in earlier petition being barred under principles of res judicata.   [Para 43,44]\n\nBecause the Bombay Municipal Corporation failed to take over the land, the validity of the sanction for the building plans of the sixth and the ninth Respondents would not be affected. The contention that the sanctioned building plans could never have been extended is, therefore, of no substance.  [Para 46]\n\nThe project was rejected on an earlier occassion but permission was granted after matter was reconsidered. The reconsideration on the part of Ministry of Environment and Forest could not be said to be malafide or arising on account of non-germane considerations. In fact, in the letter of 30th September 1993, the Ministry of Environment and Forest has indicated clearly the reasons which moved it to reconsider its stand and grant no objection to the proposal made by the State Government, after considering in detail the clarifications provided by the State Government. It has also stipulated and laid down the safeguards which should be adhered to while implementing the project. The clearance given by the Ministry of Environment and Forest is an administrative act and, as long as it satisfies the principles of Wednesbury rationality, it is not the function of Court to sit in appeal over the reasons which moved the Government to grant such sanction. First, the Ministry of Environment and Forest had the power under the CRZ Notifications read with the Environment Protection Act to grant such sanction for the proposed project. Secondly, that it could not be said that the sanction was irrational or that it proceeded on account of any collateral or impermissible motives.   [Para 50]\n\nThere was some change in the sanctioned plan. This exercise of power by the Commissioner or by the State Government does not amount to a modification of the sanctioned Development Plan requiring the following of the prescribed procedure of inviting objections, considering them and sanctioning the plan.  [Para 54]\n\nThe power of the State Government to include the Development Plan road, even if it extends within the sea, may flow from Item 13 of List II in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and it is possible to take the view that it is competent for the State Legislature to enact thereupon. Secondly, having regard to the amendment made in the CRZ Notification dated 19th February 1991 by the subsequent Notification dated 9th July 1997, sanction of the Central Government for such a road is not necessary. The Development Plan envisaged a road linking Bandra area to the Southern areas of Bombay by means of a bridge over the sea. There appears to be substance in the contention of the sixth and the ninth Respondents that under the amending Notification dated 9th July 1997 such a bridge or sealink would be a permissible activity even under Clause 2(viii) of the CRZ Notification and, prima facie, the clearance of the Central Government for such a road may not be necessary. (Matter not decided).  [Para 56]\n\nThe Central Government in the Ministry of Environment and Forest imposed conditions that the quality of treated effluents, solid wastes, emissions and noise levels etc. from the project area must conform to the standards laid down under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 by the competent authority including the Central/State Pollution Control Board. It was for this reason that the ninth Respondent applied to the State Pollution Control Board and obtained its permission subject to certain restrictions which it is bound to comply with. In these circumstances, there is no substance in the challenge to the permission granted to the sixth and the ninth Respondents by the State Pollution Control Board.   [Para 57]\n\nThe Bombay Municipal Corporation having followed consistently the practice of extending the development permission from time to time if the initial construction commenced within a period of one year of the first grant of development permission, the development permission extended from time to time cannot be said to be illegal on that count. Thus there is no contravention of Development Control Regulation.  [Para 61,64,65,66]\n\nThe development permission granted by authorities to construct hotel is not illegal or contrary to Regulation 59 as Floor Space Index of 2 : 1 has been granted. The height restriction in this Regulation would apply if the plot on which the construction is being done falls within category I or category II.  [Para 70,71,72]\n\nRespondents 6 and 9 were amalgamated under the Companies Act by the Court. The amalgamation, which has become final and binding, cannot be permitted to be challenged by the Petitioners, without locus standi, in a collateral proceeding in the Writ Petition. An amalgamation order can only be challenged under the Companies Act by an Appeal under Section 391(7) by any one of the parties, but no such appeal was ever filed. The fasciculus of Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act constitutes a complete code on the subject of amalgamation. Therefore, it is not open to the High Court while exercising writ jurisdiction in a Public Interest Litigation to sit in judgment over the correctness of an order made under Section 391 by the Company Court which has become final, conclusive and binding.  [Para 79,80,82,83]\n\nWhen an amalgamation takes place, the transfer of assets takes place by the force of the Company Court's order and/or by operation of law; it ceases to be a contractual or a consensual transfer. Therefore, Chap. XX-C of the Income tax Act does not apply to such a transfer by operation of law.   [Para 96,103]\n\nThe term \"Apparent consideration\", as defined in clause (b) of Section 269UA of the Income Tax Act, is an inalienable factor which must be reckoned with in the application of Chapter XX-C for if the Appropriate Authority is satisfied that there is undervaluation, then it is empowered to purchase the property at the apparent consideration. In a situation of amalgamation, there is no consideration - apparent or otherwise - nor is it payable in respect of any specific immovable property. The valuation put on the shares cannot be treated as \"apparent consideration\" for the purposes of transfer. If the valuation of the shares proposed to be issued upon amalgamation is below the stipulated limit, then obviously the provisions of Chapter XX-C would not apply. However, while sanctioning the scheme, the company Court may modify the scheme and provide for issuance of larger number of shares upon amalgamation. When this happens, then, for the first time, it would be the stage when the actual valuation or the consideration becomes known. Thus the consideration would be known at the stage of sanctioning of the amalgamation scheme and it would be practically impossible for any one to comply with the provisions of Section 269 UC of filing the declaration in Form 37-I in advance, or for seeking the no objection certificate from the Appropriate Authority.  [Para 100,103]\n\nEven assuming that Chapter XX-C applies to the transfer of the concerned land as a consequence of the amalgamation scheme being sanctioned by the Company Court, it can be held that Chapter XX-C is not intended to apply to situation of transfer of immovable property consequent upon an amalgamation scheme being sanctioned by an order of the Court. Once the scheme is sanctioned, it has the imprimatur of the Court and operates by the combined force of the statute and the Court's authority. The scheme as such ceases to be in the realm of an 'agreement' as contemplated under Chapter XX-C of the Income tax Act.  There is no provision in the entire Chapter XX-C providing that a transfer becomes void or non-est for non-compliance with any of the provisions contained therein. If at all the Legislature had so intended, there would have been a specific provision as contained in Section 281 of the Income Tax Act. Thus, the only consequence of failure to file a declaration in Form 37-I would be a prosecution under section 276AB and non-registration of a document by virtue of Section 269 UL of the Income Tax Act.

                "description": "Construction of Sea Rock hotel on land allotted by authorities - Land exempted under Urban Land Ceiling Act - No contravention of any Regulation - Provisions of any Statute also not breached - Construction is legal and is beyond challenge. \n\nMaharashtra Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Act (1960), S.4(3); Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act (1966), S.37 ; Urban Land (Ceiling and Regulation) Act (1976), S.30; Mumbai Municipal Corporation Act (1888), S.346; Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act 1966 and Development Control Regulations for Greater Bombay (1991), Reg. 59; Industrial Disputes Act (1947), S.2(j), Companies Act (1956), S.591, 394A, 391(7), Water (Prevention and Control of Pollution) Act (1974), S.25 ; Income tax Act (1961),  Chap. XX C ; S.269 UA ; Constitution of India Art. 226.\n\nThe Land's End Bandra is a peninsular piece of Land which juts into the sea, being covered on the East, North and West by the Sea. The land was exempted under the Urban Land Ceiling Act. There has been considerable development on this peninsular piece of land and a developed road runs North-South almost to the tip of the peninsular area. Towards the West seaward of this road, there exists a five star hotel, \"Sea Rock\", whose construction had been permitted much before the Coastal Regulation Zone Notification under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 was brought into force. Hotel Sea Rock is situated towards the North of the Bandra fort within about 100 meters therefrom. A plot of land measuring 45,000 square yards situated opposite the Hotel Sea Rock i.e. towards the Eastern side of the developed road is the subject matter of this Writ Petition. Towards the East of this plot the hill slopes down to the Mahim Bay and there is a large tract of open land which now has been encroached upon and dotted by numerous unauthorised structures, though continued to be shown as green area in the sanctioned and revised Development Plan for H-West Ward of Mumbai. The construction of the hotel Sea Rock has been challenged by a writ petition by way of public Interest Litigation by number of petitioners. The construction was challenged on the grounds as below :\n\n(a) Violation of Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) Rules.\n\n(b) Contravention of Urban Land Ceiling Act and the exemption order made thereunder.\n\n(c) Contravention of the provisions of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966.\n\n(d) Violation of the sanctioned Development Plan.\n\n(e) Challenge to the decision of the Ministry of Environment & Forest, Government of India. \n\n(f) Challenge to the Corrigendum Notification dated 22nd November 1966.\n\n(g) Challenge to sanctioned Development Plan.\n\n(h) Challenge to permission granted by the State Pollution Control Board.\n\n(i) Contravention of the provisions of the Maharashtra Regional and Town Planning Act, 1966 and Development Control Regulations for Greater Bombay, 1991.\n\n(j) Contravention of the Development Control Regulation No. 59.\n\n(k) Amalgamation of sixth and ninth Respondents, fraudulent, illegal and intended to circumvent law.\n\n(l) Application of Chapter XX-C of the Income Tax Act, 1961.\n\nHeld, that the Construction of the Hotel Sea Rock was valid and there was no contravention of any of the provisions of statutes or statutory rules or notifications under the Statutes.  [Para 17]\n\nBasically, the Coastal Regulation Zone is one which falls within 500 meters of the High Tide Line. Merely because the Bandra Fort is situated at the tip of the peninsular plot of land, the entire peninsular plot of land does not fall within CRZ-I. The restrictions against construction in CRZ-I would apply only to a stretch of 500 meters from the High Tide Line as long as that area falls within the area declared as heritage monument under the Maharashtra Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Act. Looking at the revised dimensions in the Notification of 31st July 1998, it is not possible to accept the contention that the concerned plot would fall within CRZ-I area so as to completely prohibit constructional activity on it.  [Para 33,34]\n\nThe expression industry used in Para 2(i) of the CRZ Notification dt. 19-2-1991 must take colour from the concept of environmental pollution such as Trade effluents which are discharged by the industry which would otherwise require permission from the Pollution Control Board. A careful scrutiny of the different types of activities prohibited under the different clauses of paragraph 2 of the Notification supports this view. In fact, construction of hotels is permitted in CRZ-II and CRZ-III as evidenced from paragraph 7 of the said Notification. Hence, it could not be contended that the hotel is an \"industry\" and as such construction of the hotel on the concerned plot is prohibited under paragraph 2 of the CRZ Notification.  [Para 35]\n\nThe contention that Sub. cls. (v) (vii) (viii) (ix) (xii) and (xiii) are violated by the construction of hotel \"Sea Rock\" cannot be accepted. What is prohibited by sub-clause (v) of Clause 2 of the 1991 CRZ Notification is \"discharge of untreated wastes and effluents from industries, cities or towns and other human settlements\" within the coastal regulation zone. There is no material on record to show that the hotel constructed by the Respondents discharges untreated wastes and effluents into the sea. As to the grievance against the Bombay Municipal Corporation Sewerage purification Plant, the grievance has no substance since the Bombay Municipal Corporation Sewerage Purification Plant is intended to treat city wastes and effluents and render them innocuous before being discharged into the Sea. Hence there is no violation of sub-clause (v) of Clause 2 of 1991 CRZ Notification.  Sub-clauses (viii) and (xii) of Clause 2 of the Notification are intended to permit land reclamation for limited purposes and to permit construction activity between Low Tide Line and High Tide Line for carrying of treated effluents and wastes water discharges into the sea. The Bombay Municipal Corporation Sewerage Purification Plant and the proposed pipeline fall within the activity permitted by these clauses. In fact, by the Notification dated 9th July 1997, sub-clause (viii) has been completely substituted and the activity of construction of the Bombay Municipal Corporation Sewerage Purification Plant is wholly permitted thereunder. Further sub-clause (ix) of Clause 2 of the CRZ Notification has no application at all. Sub-clause (xiii) of Clause 2 of the 1991 CRZ Notification cannot be said to be violated if what is done is permissible construction activity and anything that is reasonably necessary to carry out the permissible activity or construction of a building without violation of any of the provisions of the CRZ Notification.  Sub-clause (xiii) cannot be read in isolation and has to be read subject to the regulation of permissible activities under sub-clause (iii). That is why sub-clause (xiii) of Clause 2 of the Notification uses the expression \"except as permissible under the Notification\". If the construction activity is permitted under any other part of the Notification, then the prohibition contemplated by Clause 2, sub-clause (xiii) is not attracted.  [Para 38,39,40]\n\nIt could not be contended that the exemption granted under the Urban Land Ceiling Act (ULCA) was violated by the respondents. One of the conditions of the order dated 25th July 1978 made under Section 20 of ULCA granting exemption specifically stipulated was that \"no transfer by way of sale, mortgage, gift, lease or otherwise\" shall be made of the exempted land and that in case of violation of this condition, the exemption order was liable to be revoked. There was also a condition that the sixth Respondent was to give an area of 7000 square yards free of cost to the Bombay Municipal Corporation for being maintained as a public park. There was no violation of the conditions. Under Section 19 of ULCA read with section 5 of the Banking Regulation Act, and Section 591 of the Companies Act, Citibank is one of the entities in whose favour the land, even though exempted under section 20 of the ULCA, could have been mortgaged. The contention that the mortgage of the land to Citibank to raise finances is in violation of ULCA is, therefore, without substance and untenable. Further, there was an express order made by the Government of Maharashtra on 7th February 1980 issuing a no objection certificate for transfer of the exempted vacant land to the ninth Respondent on amalgamation with the sixth Respondent subject to certain conditions as to shareholding. By the order of the Company Court the Scheme of Amalgamation of the sixth and the ninth Respondents was sanctioned with effect from 1st August 1992. Consequently, upon the amalgamation scheme coming into operation, the undertaking of the sixth Respondent including all assets and liabilities stood vested in the ninth Respondent. Even after amalgamation, the shareholding continues to be in the same ratio as it was before. Hence there was no contravention of any condition. This issue also could not be reagitated since those pleas were repeated in earlier petition being barred under principles of res judicata.   [Para 43,44]\n\nBecause the Bombay Municipal Corporation failed to take over the land, the validity of the sanction for the building plans of the sixth and the ninth Respondents would not be affected. The contention that the sanctioned building plans could never have been extended is, therefore, of no substance.  [Para 46]\n\nThe project was rejected on an earlier occassion but permission was granted after matter was reconsidered. The reconsideration on the part of Ministry of Environment and Forest could not be said to be malafide or arising on account of non-germane considerations. In fact, in the letter of 30th September 1993, the Ministry of Environment and Forest has indicated clearly the reasons which moved it to reconsider its stand and grant no objection to the proposal made by the State Government, after considering in detail the clarifications provided by the State Government. It has also stipulated and laid down the safeguards which should be adhered to while implementing the project. The clearance given by the Ministry of Environment and Forest is an administrative act and, as long as it satisfies the principles of Wednesbury rationality, it is not the function of Court to sit in appeal over the reasons which moved the Government to grant such sanction. First, the Ministry of Environment and Forest had the power under the CRZ Notifications read with the Environment Protection Act to grant such sanction for the proposed project. Secondly, that it could not be said that the sanction was irrational or that it proceeded on account of any collateral or impermissible motives.   [Para 50]\n\nThere was some change in the sanctioned plan. This exercise of power by the Commissioner or by the State Government does not amount to a modification of the sanctioned Development Plan requiring the following of the prescribed procedure of inviting objections, considering them and sanctioning the plan.  [Para 54]\n\nThe power of the State Government to include the Development Plan road, even if it extends within the sea, may flow from Item 13 of List II in the Seventh Schedule to the Constitution and it is possible to take the view that it is competent for the State Legislature to enact thereupon. Secondly, having regard to the amendment made in the CRZ Notification dated 19th February 1991 by the subsequent Notification dated 9th July 1997, sanction of the Central Government for such a road is not necessary. The Development Plan envisaged a road linking Bandra area to the Southern areas of Bombay by means of a bridge over the sea. There appears to be substance in the contention of the sixth and the ninth Respondents that under the amending Notification dated 9th July 1997 such a bridge or sealink would be a permissible activity even under Clause 2(viii) of the CRZ Notification and, prima facie, the clearance of the Central Government for such a road may not be necessary. (Matter not decided).  [Para 56]\n\nThe Central Government in the Ministry of Environment and Forest imposed conditions that the quality of treated effluents, solid wastes, emissions and noise levels etc. from the project area must conform to the standards laid down under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 by the competent authority including the Central/State Pollution Control Board. It was for this reason that the ninth Respondent applied to the State Pollution Control Board and obtained its permission subject to certain restrictions which it is bound to comply with. In these circumstances, there is no substance in the challenge to the permission granted to the sixth and the ninth Respondents by the State Pollution Control Board.   [Para 57]\n\nThe Bombay Municipal Corporation having followed consistently the practice of extending the development permission from time to time if the initial construction commenced within a period of one year of the first grant of development permission, the development permission extended from time to time cannot be said to be illegal on that count. Thus there is no contravention of Development Control Regulation.  [Para 61,64,65,66]\n\nThe development permission granted by authorities to construct hotel is not illegal or contrary to Regulation 59 as Floor Space Index of 2 : 1 has been granted. The height restriction in this Regulation would apply if the plot on which the construction is being done falls within category I or category II.  [Para 70,71,72]\n\nRespondents 6 and 9 were amalgamated under the Companies Act by the Court. The amalgamation, which has become final and binding, cannot be permitted to be challenged by the Petitioners, without locus standi, in a collateral proceeding in the Writ Petition. An amalgamation order can only be challenged under the Companies Act by an Appeal under Section 391(7) by any one of the parties, but no such appeal was ever filed. The fasciculus of Sections 391 to 394 of the Companies Act constitutes a complete code on the subject of amalgamation. Therefore, it is not open to the High Court while exercising writ jurisdiction in a Public Interest Litigation to sit in judgment over the correctness of an order made under Section 391 by the Company Court which has become final, conclusive and binding.  [Para 79,80,82,83]\n\nWhen an amalgamation takes place, the transfer of assets takes place by the force of the Company Court's order and/or by operation of law; it ceases to be a contractual or a consensual transfer. Therefore, Chap. XX-C of the Income tax Act does not apply to such a transfer by operation of law.   [Para 96,103]\n\nThe term \"Apparent consideration\", as defined in clause (b) of Section 269UA of the Income Tax Act, is an inalienable factor which must be reckoned with in the application of Chapter XX-C for if the Appropriate Authority is satisfied that there is undervaluation, then it is empowered to purchase the property at the apparent consideration.

The valuation put on the shares cannot be treated as \"apparent consideration\" for the purposes of transfer.

The question of quantum of work, therefore, is not very relevant.\n\nIt is thus clear that the provisions of the Equal Remuneration Act, 1976, squarely govern the controversy which has been looked into by the Industrial Court.  \t\t [Para 10]"

(1973), S.167 - Special Court under Act also assigned to try cases under NDPS Act - After lapsing of Essential Commodities (Special Provisions) Act Special Court ceasing to exist but continued for purposes of NDPS Act - It cannot remand accused charged under E.C.Act.\n\nOn a fair reading of the above provisions it is clear that during the period the EC (Special Provisions) Act was in force the special Court constituted for trial of offences under EC Act had exclusive jurisdiction to try such cases. The special Court had also the power to pass order of remand under S.167 but the position changed after the EC (Special Provisions) Act lapsed by efflux of time. Thereafter, the position that used to prevail before the EC (Special Provisions) Act was enforced, stood restored and the judicial magistrates who were previously competent to try the EC Act cases got the jurisdiction to deal with such cases. The position is beyond any pale of doubt that the remand orders passed by the special Court at Madurai, long after it had ceased to exercise jurisdiction in cases under the EC Act are incompetent. Coming to the question whether the special Court constituted for trial of cases under the NDPS Act could exercise the power of remand of an accused in the EC Act case, which it was doing when the special Court constituted for the EC Act cases was in existence, the answer to the question is in the negative: for the simple reason that the special Court constituted for NDPS Act cases is a Court of exclusive jurisdiction for trial of the particular class of cases provided under the NDPS Act and it has not been vested with power of judicial Magistrate for the purpose of dealing with EC Act cases. To accept the contention raised on behalf of the appellant in this regard would in our view be contrary to the scheme of things under the Criminal Procedure Code which specifically vests the power of remand under S.167 in judicial Magistrate.

That is the ordinary place where the suit of that kind could be instituted.  The provisions of Section 20 would come into play only when the suit is not governed by any of the clauses enumerated u/s.16 of the C.P.C.

Rigid rules of natural justice are, therefore, not contemplated or envisaged. Rule 8(3)(1) of the Establishment of Medical College Regulations (Amendment) Act, 2010 (Part II), provides for only an \"opportunity and time to rectify the deficiencies\". Compliance report is called for only to ascertain whether the deficiencies pointed out were rectified or not. If the MCI is not satisfied with the manner of compliance, it can conduct a surprise inspection. After that, no further time or opportunity to rectify the deficiencies is contemplated, nor further opportunity of being heard, is provided.\n\nIn this case the deficiencies pointed out by the MCI team in its report dated 06.07.2013. In our view, the deficiencies pointed out are fundamental and very crucial, which cannot be ignored in the interest of medical education and in the interest of student community. MCI and the College authorities have to bear in mind, what is prescribed is the minimum, if the MCI dilutes the minimum standards, they will be doing violence to the statutory requirements. An order refusing approval for renewal of permission is not vitiated by violation of principles of natural justice, especially, when no allegation of bias or mala fide has been attributed against the two doctors who constituted the Inspection Team, which conducted the surprise inspection.

Further, that the applicant has the necessary land and building for running it. What is significant to note is that the law requires that an applicant must possess an Essentiality Certificate from the State Government mentioning therein that it is essential to have a Medical College as proposed by him. The purpose is inter alia to prevent the establishment of a college where none is required or to prevent unhealthy competition between too many Medical Colleges.\n\n\tThus, the Legislative scheme for permission to establish a Medical College prescribes, as a qualifying criterion, that the applicant must have an Essentiality Certificate issued by the State Government. The State Government certifies the justification for establishing a proposed Medical College as a part of the Legislative scheme under the Act. It does not do so under any other law including a State enactment. The only purpose of the Essentiality Certificate is to enable the Central Government acting under Section 10A to take an informed decision for permitting the opening or establishment of a new Medical College. Once the college is established, its functioning and performance and even the de-recognition of its courses is controlled only by the provisions of the IMC Act and not any other law.\n\n\tIt would be impermissible to allow any authority including a State Government which merely issues an Essentiality Certificate, to exercise any power which could have the effect of terminating the existence of a Medical College permitted to be established by the Central Government. This the State Government may not do either directly or indirectly. Moreover, the purpose of the Essentiality Certificate is limited to certifying to the Central Government that it is essential to establish a Medical College. It does not go beyond this. In other words, once the State Government has certified that the establishment of a Medical College is justified, it cannot at a later stage say that there was no justification for the establishment of the College. Surely, a person who establishes a Medical College upon an assurance of a State Government that such establishment is justified cannot be told at a later stage that there was no justification for allowing him to do so. Moreover, it appears that the power to issue an Essentiality Certificate is a power that must be treated as exhausted once it is exercised, except in cases of fraud.\n\n\tThe question of justified existence of a college and the irregular/illegal functioning of an existing college belong to a different order of things and cannot be mixed up.\t\t\t\t [Para 14,15,16,17]"

                "description": "Arms Act (1959), Ss.3, 5 r/w. S.25 - Evidence Act (1872), S.3 - Possession of fire arms - Possession means possession with requisite mental element, that is, conscious possession and not mere custody without the awareness of nature of such possession - Suspicion however strong, cannot take the place of proof beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nIn the case at hand, as the prosecution belatedly realized, the house did not belong to the accused but belonged to his mother in which three more adult persons were residing, namely the accused, his wife and also the sister as reflected on the electoral roll later produced on behalf of the prosecution.  The only evidence led by the prosecution to support its case that the accused was in possession of the said arms, ammunitions or explosives is the fact that the accused opened the door of the said room when directed to do by the raiding party.  That the house of the accused was searched, is a story PSI Dessai had to give up when the Mamlatdar informed him that the house stood in the name of the mother of the accused.  Prosecution produced no evidence that the room which was searched was in exclusive possession of the accused.  The house appears to have been in joint occupation of 4 adult members of the family, including that of the accused.  No doubt, the accused is a mechanic and only male member found in the said house and this would raise a strong suspicion against him that he was in possession of the articles but suspicion however strong cannot take the place of proof beyond reasonable doubt.  The house, admittedly, was in joint occupation of the aforesaid persons and in case the prosecution wanted to nail the accused with the exclusive possession of the said articles found in the said room something more was required to be done to prove that the accused was in exclusive and conscious possession of the said articles in the said room.  Prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the said articles found in the said room were in exclusive and conscious possession of the accused and on that count the accused certainly deserves to be given benefit of doubt.

Several persons were severely injured. Seriousness of the occurrence can hardly be disputed.At no stage, sanction was refused by the competent authority. It is not the case of the appellant that sanction is granted by the authority, which is not competent. It is true that the proceedings are sought to be initiated under the said Act against the appellant after three years. But, in the facts of this case, where 14 innocent persons lost their lives and several persons were severely injured due to the blast which took place in the appellant's shop, three years period cannot be termed as delay. It is also the duty of the court to see that perpetrators of crime are tried and convicted if offences are proved against them. The plea of appellant that the lapse of three years has caused prejudice to the accused. The case will be conducted in accordance with the law and the appellant will have enough opportunity to prove his innocence. Besides, equally dear to us are the victim's rights. Although the Sessions Judge discharged the appellant of the charges under Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the said Act because there was no sanction. But, the prosecution has now obtained sanction. The Sessions Judge has accepted the sanction and has directed that the trial should be started against the appellant for offences under Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the said Act, as well. The order of the Sessions Judge is affirmed by the impugned order passed by the High Court.Supreme Court has no reason to interfere in the matter and trial Court directed to frame additional charges against the appellant under Sections 3, 4, 5 and 6 of the said Act and to proceed with the trial.

The only evidence led by the prosecution to support its case that the accused was in possession of the said arms, ammunitions or explosives is the fact that the accused opened the door of the said room when directed to do by the raiding party.  That the house of the accused was searched, is a story PSI Dessai had to give up when the Mamlatdar informed him that the house stood in the name of the mother of the accused.  Prosecution produced no evidence that the room which was searched was in exclusive possession of the accused.  The house appears to have been in joint occupation of 4 adult members of the family, including that of the accused.  No doubt, the accused is a mechanic and only male member found in the said house and this would raise a strong suspicion against him that he was in possession of the articles but suspicion however strong cannot take the place of proof beyond reasonable doubt.  The house, admittedly, was in joint occupation of the aforesaid persons and in case the prosecution wanted to nail the accused with the exclusive possession of the said articles found in the said room something more was required to be done to prove that the accused was in exclusive and conscious possession of the said articles in the said room.  Prosecution has failed to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the said articles found in the said room were in exclusive and conscious possession of the accused and on that count the accused certainly deserves to be given benefit of doubt.

However, the laws of both the countries permit entertaining request for extradition from Non Treaty States also. The extradition request was made to the Government of Portugal by the Government of India under the provisions of the Extradition Act applicable to Non Treaty States i.e. Section 19 of the Act. Although the Convention was also relied upon for the extradition, as rightly pointed out by the respondent, it was not the sole basis as is apparent from the Letter of Request. The primary consideration for the request of extradition was the assurance of reciprocity. The notification dated 13.12.2002 by the Government of India directing that the provisions contained in the Extradition Act shall be applicable to the Republic of Portugal was issued keeping in view the said principle of reciprocity. For the purpose of extradition proceedings, appellant was treated as a fugitive criminal as defined under S.2(f) of the Act. In view of notification dated 13-12-2002 it is clear that the provisions of Extradition Act shall apply to Portuguese Republic in accordance with the principle of reciprocity. The provisions of the Act are applicable in respect of the extradition of appellant. The Court of Appeals of Lisbon has recognized this principle of reciprocity and the applicability of the provisions of the Extradition Act, 1962 to the Republic of Portugal. The Supreme Court of Justice and Constitutional Court of Portugal have also approved it. None of these Courts have mentioned in their orders that the accused could not be tried in India for the offences for which his trial could take place as per the domestic laws of India. A bare reading of S.21 of the Act would indicate that accused can be tried for the offences for which he has been extradited. The Supreme Court of Justice, Portugal has granted extradition of appellant for all the offences mentioned in para-1 of the order dated 27-01-2005. In addition, can also be tried for lesser offence/offences in view of Section 21 of the Extradition Act disclosed by the facts proved for the purposes of securing his surrender. The contention of the appellant that he can be tried only for the offences covered under Article 2(1) of the said Convention is misconceived in view of the fact that he was extradited not only under the said Convention but also in the light of the principle of reciprocity made applicable through the application of the Extradition Act to the Republic of Portugal. A complete reading of Article 2 of the said Convention makes it clear that it deals not only with those accused who commit the substantive offences as defined in Article 2(1) but also includes all the conspirators and those who have constructive liability for commission of the substantive offences as per Sub-section 3 of Article 2 of the Convention, which fact has also been mentioned by the Supreme Court of Justice, Portugal in para 9.4 of its order. The Court of Appeals in Lisbon, has recognized this principle of reciprocity and the applicability of the provisions of Extradition Act to Portugal. The Supreme Court of Justice and Constitutional Court of Portugal have also approved it. In view of the fact that the provisions of the Extradition Act, 1962 have been made applicable to Portugal, provisions contained in Section 21 of the Act would come into operation while conducting the trial of appellant. Thus can be tried for 'lesser offences', even if, the same are not covered by the Extradition Decree since the same is permitted under Section 21(b) of the Extradition Act. No bar has been placed by the Portuguese Courts for the trial of lesser offences in accordance with the provisions contained under Section 21(b) of the Extradition Act although Portuguese Courts were aware of the said provisions of Extradition Act. In the instant case the extradition has been allowed by the requested State on the specific undertaking of the Government of India that the extradited criminal will not be subjected to death penalty or imprisonment beyond 25 years. Therefore, the basic human rights considerations have been taken into account. Thus, primacy has been accorded to human right norms in the extradition process.  [Para 28,32,59]"

But extradition is different from deportation by which competent State authorities order a person to leave a country and prevent him from returning to the same territory. Extradition is also different from exclusion, by which an individual is prohibited from staying in one part of a Sovereign State. As a result of such orders, sometimes deserters or absentees from Armed Forces of a particular country are returned to the custody of Armed Forces of the country to which they belong. Both deportation and exclusion basically are non-consensual exercise whereas extradition is based on a consensual treaty obligation between the requesting State and the requested State. Extradition, however, is only to be resorted to in cases of serious offences. [Para 40,43,44]"

It is thus clear that the sugarcane growers are not only estopped from exporting the sugarcane to some other Karkhana but they are liable to be prosecuted on account of such action.  In addition, clause 13 of the Reservation Order gives powers to the Director of Sugar or any officer authorised by him to require production of books of account, documents, inspection of record, to break open and search any place, to search, seize and remove and to take into custody the crop of sugarcane.  This power is wide enough to cast a duty on the director and his subordinates to ensure that the provisions of the Reservation Order are complied with by all the concerned.  It is, therefore, a legal or public duty cast on the sugar factory to harvest, lift and crush the sugarcane cultivated within its reserved area pursuant to the Zoning/Reservation Order passed by the State Government and the Director of Sugar and his subordinates are duty bound to ensure that the terms of the said order are strictly complied with by the parties concerned, namely, the sugar factory and sugarcane growers.  Thus in case of failure to harvest and crush sugarcane by the Karkhana in its reserved area the Karkhana is liable to pay compensation to the sugarcane grower.  That apart in the instant case, the High Court had directed the owners of Karkhana to give compensation to the sugarcane growers for failure to harvest and crush the sugarcane and the SLP filed by the Karkhana was allowed to be withdrawn and hence the Karkhana owners could not take plea that the High Court has no power to grant compensation."
