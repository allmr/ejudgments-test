Nor is there any provision in the Official Trustees (Maharashtra) Rules, 1971, requiring the Official Trustee to obtain the permission of the High Court to initiate legal proceedings. Nor there is any provision under the Indian Trusts Act, 1882 requiring him to do so. \t [Para 44,45]\n\nThere is nothing that prevents an Official Trustee from seeking permission later, i.e., after filing the proceedings. It would always be open to the Official Trustee to seek permission of the Court subsequently. In other words, even if the proceedings are filed without the permission of the Court, they would not be void for that reason. The Court would not lack inherent jurisdiction to entertain proceedings filed by an Official Trustee without the permission of the Court even assuming that such permission was required. [Para 49]"

No consent or sanction of the Government or any authority, as contemplated by Explanation to sub-sec. (3) of S. 470, Cr. P.C., is required for filing the complaint under the Act. 'Consent' or 'sanction' envisaged under S. 470, Cr. P.C. cannot be equated with the 'order' or 'authority' for the purposes of filing the complaint as envisaged by sub-section (3) of S. 13 of the Act. Specific provisions have been made in various statutes requiring previous consent or sanction for the purposes of launching of prosecution against the accused under those enactments. Explanation to sub-sec. (3) of S. 470, Cr. P.C. obviously refers to such consents and sanctions and not the order or authority as required under the Act.  [Para 4]\n\nOn critical examination of the plain words of the sub-section and the object underlying it, we do not agree that the aforesaid sub-section has two parts, as argued. We conceive no doubt that sub-section (3) of S. 13 envisages only the filing of the complaint, by order of or under authority from the appropriate Government or by an officer empowered by such Government. If the intention of the Legislature was to have the section in two parts, one dealing with the grant of consent or sanction by way of order and the other part dealing with the authority of the person to file the complaint, in that case after the words \"made by order of\", there should not have been a \"comma\" and the word \"or\". In that event for the word \"or\" the Legislature must have used the word \"and\" and omitted the comma.  [Para 7]\n\nWe, therefore, agree with the submissions that no sanction or consent is provided to be taken from the Government under S. 13(3) of the Act and the period spent in obtaining the orders for filing the complaint cannot be excluded under Explanation to sub-sec. (3) of S. 470.  [Para 9]"

                "description": "Constitutional validity of Ss.5 and 6 - Contention that in absence of any definition of expression \"high public or political office\" State Govt. will have unfettered power to pick and choose any person for being prosecuted - Key words of S.5(1) are \"prima facie evidence of the commission of the offence alleged\" - Regard being had to the text, context and legislative intendment, principle of reading down can be applied to save it from constitutional invalidity - Applying said principle, State Govt. has no discretion except to see whether offence comes u/S.13(1)(e) of PC Act or not - Once that is seen, concerned authority has no other option but to make a declaration u/S.5(1) of Orissa Act - Consequent upon such declaration, institution of case in terms of S.6 would follow - Provisions held to be constitutionally valid.\n\n Interpretation of the stipulations in Section 5 are to be appreciated in the context of the scheme of the Orissa Act. Section 2(d) defines the term \"offence\" which means an \"offence\" of criminal misconduct within the meaning of clause (e) of sub-section (1) of Section 13 of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. Section 5(1) confers power on the State to form an opinion that there is prima facie evidence of commission of an offence alleged to have been committed by a person who has held high public or political office in the State of Orissa and then proceed to make the declaration to that effect. The key words are \"prima facie evidence of the commission of the offence alleged\". \n\n Regard being had to the text, context and the legislative intendment, the principle of reading down can be applied to save it from the constitutional invalidity. May it be mentioned that there are certain authorities which have held that such provisions are valid when the power is vested with high authority and there is guidance in the language employed in the provision. But we prefer to take this route as we find the legislature never intended to leave any offender.\n\n The interpretation placed herein comes within both the conceptions, namely, textual and contextual interpretation as well as also reading down the provision to save it from unconstitutionality. By such reading down, no distortion is caused.\n\n Applying said principle, State Government is only to be prima facie satisfied that there is an offence under Section 13(1)(e) and the accused has held high public or political office in the State. Textually understanding, the legislation has not clothed the State Government with the authority to scrutinize the material for any other purpose. The State Government has no discretion except to see whether the offence comes under Section 13(1) (e) or not. Such an interpretation flows when it is understood that in the entire texture provision turns around the words \"offence alleged\" and \"prima facie\". It can safely be held that the State Government before making a declaration is only required to see whether the person as understood in the context of the provision is involved in an offence under Section 13(1)(e) of the Prevention of Corruption Act and once that is seen, the concerned authority has no other option but to make a declaration. That is the command of the legislature and once the declaration is made, the prosecution has to be instituted in a Special Court and that is the mandate of Section 6(1) of the Orissa Act. The constitutional validity of the provisions is hereby upheld on the base of above interpretation. The argument and challenge would fail, once on interpretation it is held that there is no element of discretion and only prima facie satisfaction is required as laid down hereinabove. \t [Para 86,93,97,98]"

It is to be noted that as the assent of the President under Article 254(2) of the Constitution has been obtained and the assent is valid in law, the State law will operate. Article 14 comes into play where equals are treated as unequals. The persons holding high public or political office in the State of Odisha are governed by the Orissa Act. The State legislature has passed the Orissa Act having regard to the obtaining situation in the State as the objects and reasons of the said Act do reflect. The legislature in its wisdom has enacted the law.

The Public Prosecutor, as mandated under Section 13(2) is required to file an application indicating the reasons on the basis ofwhich the State Government believes that the delinquent officer has procured the property by means of the offence. Thus, reasons have to be stated in the application and it has to be clearly averred that the property has been acquired by means of the offence as defined under the Orissa Act. The authorised officer is a judicial officer and is required to afford reasonable opportunity of hearing to the accused orany other person operating the property on his behalf. Discretion is also conferred on the authorised officer to record a finding whether all or any other money or property in question have been acquired illegally. The said authority can drop the proceedings or direct confiscation of all or some properties. Affording of a reasonable opportunity of hearing is not confined only to file affidavits. When the delinquent is entitled to furnish an explanation and also put forth his stand, he certainly can bring on record such material to sustain his explanation. Confiscation proceeding as provided under sub-section (3) of Section 15 is subject to appeal. In view of the scheme of the Orissa Act, there can be no shadow of doubt that there is ample guidance in the procedure for confiscation. It is not a proceeding where on the basis of launching of prosecution, the properties are confiscated. Therefore, the proceedings relating to confiscation cannot be regarded as violative of article 14 because conferment of unchecked power or lack of guidance. \t [Para 144]"

Rule 59 of the Offshore Areas Mineral Concession Rules, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as Rules of 2006) prescribes the manner of preferring an appeal under Section 34 of the Act of 2002.
