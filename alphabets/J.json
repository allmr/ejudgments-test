Allegations of not carrying out a prompt search of the missing children; of delay in the lodging of formal complaint with the police and failure to take adequate measures to guard the access from the ashram to the river, which are the principal allegations made in the FIR, cannot make out a case of culpable homicide not amounting to murder punishable under Section 304 IPC. To attract the ingredients of the said offence something more positive than a mere omission, lapse or negligence on the part of the named accused will have to be present. Such statements are conspicuously absent in the FIR filed in the present case. A reading of the relevant part of the opinion of the Forensic Medicine Department would go to show that possibility of death of the children by drowning cannot be ruled out. Expert opinion available on record indicates that mere absence of diatom will not exclude the aforesaid possibility. The relevant part of the post mortem report, as extracted, indicates presence of mud in the trachea of the children which fact also point to the possibility of death by drowning. The absence of any injuries on the body of the deceased; the attack on the bodies by wild animals and the possibility of the taking away of the missing organs of the deceased by wild animals are all mentioned in the post-mortem report. The said facts cannot be excluded or ignored while construing the prima facie liability of the accused named in the FIR. The absence of any positive material to show the practice of black magic in connection with the incident is another significant fact that has to be taken note of. Taking into account all the aforesaid facts it cannot be said that the High Court, in the present case, had committed any error in exercising its jurisdiction to interdict the investigation of the offence under section 304 IPC against the accused named in the FIR.

Accused in support of his claim of being a juvenile, the defence has produced a copy of one Parivar Register and Transfer Certificate in which the date of birth is mentioned as 5.8.1988. There is a report of Nani Daman Government Hospital where he was examined on 30.9.2004 and his dental age was shown as under 18 years. In the report of the Medical Board, when he was examined on 30.11.2004, the age is stated as more than 18 years and less than 20 years. Thus, the indicator of age moves from 18 to 20 years Thus, it says that a margin of error in age is to be made of two years on either side. Thus, in the present case, if it is to be considered on the higher side, then it can be 22 years and if it is to be considered on the lower side, it could be 16 to 18 years. It is further settled position of law that if two inferences are possible then the inference in favour of the accused is to be adopted by the Court and that benefit is to be given to the accused. The learned Sessions Judge ought to have accepted this settled position of law so also the documentary evidence of Parivar Register which shows the date of birth as 5.8.1988. So, it comes hardly to 16 years as on 18.7.2004. The benefit of margin of error in age if given, then the accused falls below the age of 18 years of age. Thus, he is a juvenile in conflict with law, as per the definition u/s 2(k) of the Act. In these circumstances hold that accused No.1 being a juvenile under the Act of 2000, be given benefit under the Act. In the present case, accused No.1 is in the prison since 19.7.2007 and thus, he has undergone sentence of rigorous imprisonment in the jail for a period of 6 years. Though he is entitled to get the benefit under the Juvenile Act, considering the period of sentence undergone by accused No.1. He be released, if he is not required in any other offence.\n\n2006 (5) SCC 584 : 2006 (2) SCC (Cri) 632, 1982 (2) SCC 538, 2002 ALL MR (Cri) 713 (S.C.), 2013 ALL MR (Cri) 2984 (S.C.)

For, the provisions postulate that the Court has to take evidence as may be necessary so as to determine the age of such person and shall record a finding whether the person is a Juvenile or a child or not, stating his age as nearly as may be. As per Rule 12(3), the Court is required to first seek evidence by obtaining the specified certificate in sub-clauses (i) to (iii) of Clause (a) and in absence thereof seek medical opinion from a duly constituted Medical Board. Further, if exact assessment of the age cannot be done, the Court for the reasons to be recorded, may, if considered necessary, give benefit to the child or juvenile by considering his/her age on lower side within the margin of one year. Furthermore, while passing order in such cases, the \"Court\" is expected to record a finding in respect of the age of the person. Finding so recorded by the \"Court\" alone can be conclusive proof of the age as regards such child or juvenile in conflict with law.  [Para 6]"

In case the trial Court did not believe the certificate, it ought to have sought the opinion of the Medical Board for determining the age of the accused. The Court has completely ignored the requirement of rule 12 which has not been referred to by it. In doing so, the order has resulted in defeating the purpose of the Act, which was enacted to consolidate the law relating to juvenile in conflict with law and children in need of care and protection by adopting a child friendly approach in the adjudication and disposition of matters in the best interests of children and for their ultimate rehabilitation. This law has been enacted, inter alia, in discharge of the primary responsibility of the State for ensuring that all the needs of the children are met and their basic rights are fully protected vide clause (3) of Article 15, clauses (e) and (f) of Article 39 and Articles 45 and 47 of the Constitution of India and in pursuance of the Convention on the Rights of the Child adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations and ratified by the Government of India. If a person is found to be a juvenile, the Court is bound to ensure that the trial is in accordance with the Act. This is obviously not possible if the trial Court fails to determine the age of the juvenile when raised before it. It was not permissible for the trial court to reject the application without sufficient reasons and because the prosecution has disputed the contents of the birth certificate and the contents of the extract of birth register, the trial Court was duty bound in law to exhaust the modes of determining the age provided by the law and render a clear finding about the age of the petitioner. This not having been done, the impugned order is set aside. The matter is remanded back to the trial Court for a fresh decision, in accordance with law.\t\t\t\t [Para 7]"

It is also an admitted fact in the affidavit of the respondents, that the order was received by the Thane Jail Authorities on the same day i.e. on 7th March, 2003.  It was, however, stated that because of non-availability of police escort, that the order could not be implemented and first petitioner could not be shifted to the Observation Home nor he could be produced before the Juvenile Justice Board.  It is thus clear that without there being any fault on the part of the accused (petitioner No.1), he was kept in prison, firstly at Thane and then in Mumbai.  Therefore, his prayer for payment of compensation must be upheld.  It is on record that the first petitioner was shifted to Mumbai Central Prison from Thane Prison on April 20, 2003, and only after an order passed by this Court on 11th June, 2003 his case was referred to the Juvenile Justice Board and he was taken to Observation Home on 13th June, 2003.  Thus, there was a gap of more than three months in carrying out the order passed by the learned Additional Sessions Judge.  The order dated 7th March, 2003 was implemented and effected only on 13th June, 2003.\n\nConsidering the facts and circumstances, however, that an offence had been registered against the first petitioner and as stated by the complainant, the accused was of 22 years age, who alleged to have committed offences punishable under Sections 302 and 307 of the Indian Penal Code, and according to the Police Officer, the accused himself had stated his age to be 20 years at the time of arrest (which was disputed by the accused) coupled with the fact that the order dated 7th March, 2003 could not be implemented in view of non-availability of police escort, the action cannot be termed mala fide or malicious.  In the facts and circumstances, therefore, ends of justice would be met, if the respondent-State is ordered to pay to petitioner No.1 an amount of compensation of Rs.15,000/- (Rupees Fifteen thousand only).  2002 ALL MR (Cri) 1373 - Followed. \t [Para 12,13,16,17]"

(1973), Ss.437, 439 - Bail to juvenile - Application to be dealt with only under provisions of JJ Act - Provisions u/Ss.437 and 439 of CrPC would stand excluded.\n\n\tA conjoint analysis of the provisions contained in Sections 437 and 439 of the Code viz a viz Sections 8, 10 and 12 of the Act, 2015 would discern that while there are certain general guidelines under Sections 437 & 439 of the Code, power in respect of grant of bail to a juvenile is more liberal in the nature of command under Section 12 (1) that whenever an apparent juvenile alleged to have committed a bailable or non-bailable offence is detained by the police or appears or brought before a Board, such person shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code or in any other law for the time being in force, be released on bail with or without surety or placed under the supervision of a probation officer or under the care of any fit person. The only rider for not releasing the apparent juvenile is that whenever there appears reasonable grounds for believing that the release is likely to bring that person (Juvenile) into association with any known criminal or expose the said person to moral, physical or psychological danger or his release would defeat the ends of justice, the Board shall record the reasons for denying the bail and circumstances that led to such a decision. This rider as contained in proviso to Section 12 (1) requires the Board to record reasons for denying the bail. It would mean that ordinarily the bail is to be allowed to a juvenile. The denial being exceptional on certain reasons to be recorded by the Board as provided in the proviso. This special provision is not contained under Section 439 of the Code.\n\n\tIt is also to notice that under the statutory scheme of the Act of 2015, a comprehensive provision has been made as to how a child in conflict with law has to be dealt with when he is apprehended and not released on bail. The said provisions are contained under sub-sections (2), (3) & (4) of Section 12 of the Act of 2015. Under the said provision, on denial of bail, such person (Juvenile) has to be kept in observation home in the manner prescribed until he is brought before the Board. It is also provided that when a child in conflict with law is unable to fulfill the conditions of bail within 7 days of the bail order, such child shall be produced before the Board for modification of the conditions of bail.\n\n\tThe provisions pari materia to this are not available under Section 439 of the Code, therefore, on denial of bail under Section 439 of the Code or when the bail is allowed but the juvenile is not able to satisfy the conditions of bail, it is not mandated under the Code that such child shall be produced before the Board for modification of the conditions of bail. In the absence of this provision either in case of denial of bail or even when the bail is allowed under Section 439 of the Code, but the conditions of bail are not satisfied, the juvenile would be deprived of his statutory right under Section 12 (2), (3) & (4) of the Act of 2015. It is precisely for this reason Section 12 of the Act of 2015 provides for overriding effect due to use of non-obstante clause, therefore, the post arrest bail of juvenile in conflict with law is required to be dealt with under the special provision contained in Section 12 of the Act of 2015 and to the said extent it will exclude operation of Section 437 and/or Section 439 of the Code.\n\n\tTherefore, Section 12 of the Act of 2015 having included 'notwithstanding anything contained in the Code or in any other law for the time being in force, the provisions as contained in the Code in respect of grant of bail under Sections 437 and 439 of the Code has to be excluded and shall not apply while considering the juvenile's right to be enlarged on bail for which a specific provision has been made under Section 12 and thereafter the appellate and revisional powers of the Court of Sessions and the High Court as contained in Sections 101 and 102 of the Act of 2015, as the case may be.\n\n2005 Cri L J 3271 Overruled. \t\t\t\t [Para 7,9,10,15]"

It permits parents to adopt a child of the same sex even if they have a living biological child of the same sex. It is often thought that a subtle differentiation may be made by the parents between a biological child and an adoptive child of the same sex. The legislature has therefore expressly permitted adoption of a child of the same sex even if the parents have a biological child or children of the same sex living on the date of adoption. Section 6(b) or any other provision of the Juvenile Justice Act does not prevent adoption of a child where the adoptive parents have another living adopted child of the same sex.  [Para 5,6]"

                "description": "Claim of juvenility - Admission register of Higher Secondary School where appellant first studied was produced by Principal of school - Is a relevant piece of evidence - There was nothing to refute or rebut factum of date of birth entered in school admission register - Said document conclusively establish that appellant was juvenile on date of incident - Order of Trial Court not accepting school admission register and making fishing inquiry to determine basis on which date of birth was entered in school register - Is not proper. \n\nThe procedure to be followed under the J.J. Act in conducting an inquiry is the procedure laid down in that statute itself i.e. Rule 12 of the 2007 Rules. \"Age determination inquiry\" contemplated under section 7A of the Act r/w Rule 12 of the 2007 Rules enables the court to seek evidence and in that process, the court can obtain the matriculation or equivalent certificates, if available. Only in the absence of any matriculation or equivalent certificates, the court needs to obtain the date of birth certificate from the school first attended other than a play school. Only in the absence of matriculation or equivalent certificate or the date of birth certificate from the school first attended, the court need obtains to the birth certificate given by a corporation or a municipal authority or a panchayat (not an affidavit but certificates or documents). The question of obtaining medical opinion from a duly constituted Medical Board arises only if the above mentioned documents are unavailable. In case exact assessment of the age cannot be done, then the court, for reasons to be recorded, may, if considered necessary, give the benefit to the child or juvenile by considering his or her age on lower side within the margin of one year. Once the court, following the above mentioned procedures, passes an order; that order shall be the conclusive proof of the age as regards such child or juvenile in conflict with law. It has been made clear in sub-section (5) or Rule 12 that no further inquiry shall be conducted by the court or the Board after examining and obtaining the certificate or any other documentary proof after referring to sub-rule (3) of the Rule 12. Further, Section 49 of the J.J. Act also draws a presumption of the age of the Juvenility on its determination. Age determination inquiry contemplated under the JJ Act and Rules has nothing to do with an enquiry under other legislations, like entry in service, retirement, promotion etc. There may be situations where the entry made in the matriculation or equivalent certificates, date of birth certificate from the school first attended and even the birth certificate given by a Corporation or a Municipal Authority or a Panchayat may not be correct. But Court, J.J. Board or a Committee functioning under the J.J. Act is not expected to conduct such a roving enquiry and to go behind those certificates to examine the correctness of those documents, kept during the normal course of business. Only in cases where those documents or certificates are found to be fabricated or manipulated, the Court, the J.J. Board or the Committee need to go for medical report for age determination. In the present case the court examined the question of juvenility of the appellant as if it was conducting a criminal trial or inquiry under the Code. Notice was issued on the application filed by the juvenile and in response to that State as well as the widow of the victim filed objection to the application. The father of the appellant was cross examined as PW 1 and was permitted to produce several documents including the mark sheet of class five  mark sheet of class eight mark sheet of Intermediate Education Board, MP, horoscope etc. Further, the mother of the appellant was examined as PW 4, Transfer Certificate was produced on the side of the appellant. Noticing that the parents of the appellant were attempting to show a lesser age of the child so as to escape from the criminal case, the Court took steps to conduct ossification test. Held, that the admission register in the school in which the candidate first attended is a relevant piece of evidence of the date of birth. The reasoning that the parents could have entered a wrong date of birth in the admission register hence not a correct date of birth is equal to thinking that parents would do so in anticipation that child would commit a crime in future and, in that situation, they could successfully raise a claim of juvenility. Thus the appellant has successfully established his juvenility on the date of occurrence of the crime i.e. 19.10.2008 on which date he was aged only 17 years 11 months 25 days and therefore sentence award to him would be set aside.

The expression \"conflict with law under any such law\" would have to be understood to be a conflict with law under any other law other than the JJ Act of 2000, and, therefore, notwithstanding the provisions of any other law, the provisions of only the JJ Act of 2000 shall thereafter apply to all such cases of a juvenile being in conflict with law. In other words, after a person has been determined to be a juvenile, the provisions of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 shall no longer be applicable for determination of any of the aspect as regards the detention, prosecution, penalty or sentence of imprisonment of juveniles in conflict with law. If the Code of Criminal Procedure is not longer applicable, an appeal under Section 374 would also not be maintainable and, therefore, the correctness of the conviction that may have been made under the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973 cannot further be determined. In the aforesaid situation, we are left only with the provision of Section 7A(2) of the JJ Act of 2000 which clearly provides that if a Court finds a person to be juvenile on the date of commission of offence, it shall forward the juvenile to the Board for passing an appropriate order.\n\n2015 ALL MR (Cri) JOURNAL 31 Dissented from. \t\t [Para 15]"

In case exact assessment of the age cannot be done, the Court or the Board or, as the case may be, the Committee, for the reasons to be recorded by them, may, if considered necessary, give benefit to the child or juvenile by considering his/her age on lower side within the margin of one year.     [Para 14]\n\nGoing by sub-rule 3(a)(ii) of aforesaid Rule 12, the date of birth certificate from the school (other than a play school) first attended, comes at the second stage in the order of priority for consideration to ascertain the age of accused claiming to be a juvenile. In the case on hand, the appellant does not claim to be a matriculate. Therefore, the question of matriculation or equivalent certificate and its availability does not arise. The present claim as a juvenile is based on the School Leaving Certificate issued by the school in which the appellant stated to have studied up to 5th class. As per the said certificate, the date of birth recorded in the school admission register and the corresponding entry in the School Leaving Certificate was 01.12.1981. The appellant stated to have joined the school on 01.08.1989 and left the school after subsequently completing his 5th standard on 01.07.1992. The correctness of the said certificate was examined by the Court below as directed by Supreme Court. The Principal/Head Master of the School also verified the admission register. The counterfoil of the said School Leaving Certificate is placed before Court. A perusal of the report also discloses that the certificate was genuine, that the date of birth record therein has been found to be correct and once the said position could be ascertained based on the above report, applying Rule 12 (3) as well as sub-rules (4) and (5) the said Rule read along with Section 7A of the Act the appellant on 11.03.1998 was 16 years 3 months and 10 days old. Thus on basis of the report of the District and sessions judge, the appellant was below 18 years of age on the date of commission of offence and the Juvenile Justice Act would apply in full force in his case also. While upholding the conviction imposed on the appellant, the Supreme Court set aside the sentence imposed on him and direct that he be released forthwith, if not required in any other case.

But when an accused commits a grave and heinous offence and thereafter attempts to take statutory shelter under the guise of being a minor, a casual or cavalier approach while recording as to whether an accused is a juvenile or not cannot be permitted as the courts are enjoined upon to perform their duties with the object of protecting the confidence of common man in the institution entrusted with the administration of justice. Hence, while the courts must be sensitive in dealing with the juvenile who is involved in cases of serious nature like sexual molestation, rape, gang rape, murder and host of other offences, the accused cannot be allowed to abuse the statutory protection by attempting to prove himself as a minor when the documentary evidence to prove his minority gives rise to a reasonable doubt about his assertion of minority. Under such circumstance, the medical evidence based on scientific investigation will have to be given due weight and precedence over the evidence based on school administration records which give rise to hypothesis and speculation about the age of the accused.\n\nIn the present case, the accused is alleged to have committed a crime which repels against moral conscience as he chose a girl of 13 and a half years to satisfy his lust by hatching a plot with the assistance of his accomplice who already stands convicted and thereafter the accused has attempted to seek protection under the plea that he committed such an act due to his innocence without understanding its implication in which his father is clearly assisting by attempting to rope in a story that he was a minor on the date of the incident which is not based on conclusive evidence worthy of credence but is based on a confused story as also shaky and fragile nature of evidence which hardly inspires confidence. The benefit of the principle of benevolent legislation attached to Juvenile Justice Act would apply to only such cases wherein the accused is held to be a juvenile on the basis of at least prima facie evidence regarding his minority as the benefit of the possibilities of two views in regard to the age of the alleged accused who is involved in grave and serious offence which he committed and gave effect to it in a well planned manner reflecting his maturity of mind rather than innocence indicating that his plea of juvenility is more in the nature of a shield to dodege or dupe the arms of law, cannot be allowed to come to his rescue. Hence if the plea of juvenility or the fact that he had not attained the age of discretion so as to understand the consequence of his heinous act is not free from ambiguity or doubt, the said plea cannot be allowed to be raised merely on doubtful school admission record and in the event it is doubtful, the medical evidence will have to be given due weightage while determining the age of the accused.

In such eventuality is it still necessary to send the matter to the Juvenile Justice Board for consideration of sentence and passing order under Section 15 of the Juvenile Justice Act. ? In this regard it is also necessary to refer to Sub Section 2 of Section 6 which empowers the High Court and the Court of Session to exercise all powers conferred on the Juvenile Justice Board when examining an appeal revision of otherwise. The courts thus stand empowered to pass such orders qua the person asserting a plea of juvenility on the date of the offence, prescribed under Section 15 of the JJ Act, of course bearing in mind the age of the person and sentence already undergone by him. Therefore if the conviction is maintained, then the Appellate Court would also examine the facts and circumstances of the case, and if deemed appropriate refer the juvenile appellant to the Juvenile Justice Board for consideration of the sentence. However, if the appellant has ceased to be a juvenile on the date of consideration of the sentence, that is, he has crossed 18 years - the maximum age for which he/she could be lodged in the special home or if the appellant has already undergone a sentence equal to or more than that prescribed under the Juvenile Justice Act, then the court while setting aside the sentence would be required to mould relief appropriately.

                "description": "Adoption of child - Scope and applicability of Juvenile Justice Act - Juvenile Justice Act is a special enactment dealing with children in conflict with law and children in need of care and protection - Religious identity of child or of parents who adopt is not a pre-condition to applicability of the law - Law is secular and deals with conditions of social destitution which cut across religious identities.\n\nThe Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 and the Juvenile Justice Act, 2000 must be harmoniously construed. The Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 deals with conditions requisite for adoption by Hindus. The Juvenile Justice Act of 2000 is a special enactment dealing with children in conflict with law and children in need of care and protection. While enacting the Juvenile Justice Act, 2000 the legislature has taken care to ensure that its provisions are secular in character and that the benefit of adoption is not restricted to any religious or social group. The focus of the legislation is on the condition of the child taken in adoption. If the child is orphaned, abandoned or surrendered, that condition is what triggers the beneficial provisions for adoption. The legislation seeks to ensure social integration of such children and adoption is one method to achieve that object. The religious identity of the child or of the parents who adopt is not a precondition to the applicability of the law. The law is secular and deals with conditions of social destitution which cut across religious identities. The legislature in its wisdom clarified in sub-section (6) of Section 41 that the Court may allow a child to be given in adoption to parents to adopt a child of the same sex irrespective of the number of living biological sons or daughters. This provision is intended to facilitate the rehabilitation of orphaned, abandoned or surrendered children. The condition must apply to all persons irrespective of religious affiliation who seek to adopt children of that description. The object of rehabilitation and providing for social reintegration to orphaned, abandoned or surrendered children is a matter of high legislative policy. It is in effectuation of that policy that the legislature has stipulated that adoption of such a child must proceed irrespective of the marital status of a person taking in adoption and irrespective of the number of living biological children of the parents seeking adoption. Consequently, where the child which is sought to be adopted falls within the description of an orphaned, abandoned or surrendered child within the meaning of sub-section (2) of Section 41 or a child in need of care and protection under clause (d) of Section 2, the provisions of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 must prevail. In such a case the embargo that is imposed on adopting a child of the same sex by a Hindu under clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 11 of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 must give way to the salutary provisions made by the Juvenile Justice Act. Where, however, the child is not of a description falling under the purview of Chapter IV of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2000, a Hindu desirous of adopting a child continues to be under the embargo imposed by clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 11 of the Act of 1956. If the two pieces of legislation, both of which are enacted by Parliament are harmoniously construed, there is no conflict of interpretation.  [Para 20]"

                "description": "Applicability of Act - Act would be applicable in a pending proceeding in any court/authority initiated under the 1986 Act and is pending when 2000 Act came into force and the person had not completed 18 years of age as on 1-4-2000.\n\nPer Sema, J.(for himself and on behalf of N. Santosh Hegde, S. N.Variava and B. P. Singh, JJ.):- Section 20 of the Act as quoted above deals with the special provision in respect of pending cases and begins with non-obstante clause. The sentence \"notwithstanding anything contained in this Act, all proceedings in respect of a juvenile pending in any Court in any area on date of which this Act came into force\" has great significance. The proceedings in respect of a juvenile pending in any Court referred to in Section 20 of the Act is relatable to proceedings initiated before the 2000 Act came into force and which are pending when the 2000 Act came into force. The term \"any court\" would include even ordinary criminal Courts. If the person was a \"juvenile\" under the 1986 Act the proceedings would not be pending in criminal Courts. They would be pending in criminal Courts only if the boy had crossed 16 years or girl had crossed 18 years. This shows that Section 20 refers to cases where a person had ceased to be a juvenile under the 1986 Act but had not yet crossed the age of 18 years then the pending case shall continue in that Court as if the 2000 Act has not been passed and if the Court finds that the juvenile has committed an offence, it shall record such finding and instead of passing any sentence in respect of the juvenile, shall forward the juvenile to the Board which shall pass orders in respect of that juvenile. We, therefore, hold that the provisions of 2000 Act would be applicable to those cases initiated and pending trial/inquiry for the offences committed under the 1986 Act provided that the person had not completed 18 years of age as on 1-4-2001.   [Para 31,36]\n\nPer Sinha, J.:-\tSection 20 of the Act of 2000 would be applicable when a person is below the age of 18 years as on 1-4-2001. For the purpose of attracting S.20 of the Act, it must be established that : (i) on the date of coming into force the proceedings in which the petitioner was accused was pending; and (ii) on that day he was below the age of 18 years. For the purpose of the said Act, both the aforementioned conditions are required to be fulfilled. By reason of the provisions of the said Act of 2000, the protection granted to a juvenile has only been extended but such extension is not absolute but only a limited one. It would apply strictly when the conditions precedent therefor as Contained in S.20 or S.64 are fulfilled. The said provisions repeatedly refer to the words 'juvenile' or 'delinquent Juveniles' specifically. This appears to be the object of the Act and for ascertaining the true intent of the Parliament, the rule of purposive construction must be adopted. The purpose of the Act would stand defeated if a child continues to be in the company of an adult. Thus, the Act of 2000 intends to give the protection only to a juvenile within the meaning of the said Act and not an adult. In other words, although it would apply to a person who is still a juvenile having not attained the age of 18 years but shall not apply to a person who has already attained the age of 18 years on the date of coming into force thereof or who had not attained the age of 18 years on the date of commission of the offence but has since ceased to be a juvenile. [Para 98]\n\nThe embargo of giving a retrospective effect to a statute arises only when it takes away vested right of a person. By reasons of S.20 of the Act no vested right in a person has been taken away, but thereby only an additional protection has been provided to a juvenile.  [Para 99]\n\nIn a case of this nature where an additional protection had been granted pursuant to or in furtherance of the international treaties and keeping in view of the experience which had been gathered by the Parliament after coming into force of the 1986 Act, we think that it should be read in such a fashion so that the extended benefit can be granted even to the juvenile under the 2000 Act. Furthermore, sub-section (2) of S.69 provides that all proceedings shall be deemed to have been held under the new Act. This is also suggestive of the fact that the new Act would, to the aforementioned extent, apply to a pending proceeding which was initiated under the 1986 Act.   [Para 110]"

Its functions are circumscribed by S.70 of the Act only. It has not been authorised to make any rule. Such rule making power has been entrusted only to the State. The Central Government has, thus, no say in the matter nor can it exercise such power by resorting to its power 'to remove difficulties.' Rule making power is a separate power which has got nothing to do with the power to remove difficulty. By reason of the power to remove difficulty or doubt, the Central Government has not been conferred with any legislative power. The power to remove doubt or difficulty although is a statutory power but the same is not akin to a legislative power and, thus, thereby the provisions of the Act cannot be altered.   [Para 111]\n\nThe age of the delinquent juvenile, therefore, cannot be determined in terms of the model rule 62. Any law mandating the Court to take into consideration certain documents over others in determining an issue, must be provided for only by law. Only a validly made law can take away the power of the Court to appreciate evidence for the purpose of determination of such a question in the light of S.35 of the Indian Evidence Act. It cannot be done by the Central Government in exercise of the executive power.   [Para 112]"

However, the trial Court did not call upon the parties to lead evidence in support of the date of birth so that there was an opportunity for both the parties to place such evidence in support of their respective contentions.\n\nThis is an issue which will have to be decided on adducing documentary as well as oral evidence before the trial Court.  The certificate issued is of a private school and original or photostat copy cannot be accepted as reliable evidence unless the parties are allowed to lead evidence before the Court and the prosecution is given an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses of the defence and also to bring on record evidence to the contra.  Though by an interlocutory order passed in this Criminal Application the Police Officer was called upon to do the same, there are no findings which could be relied upon and Court has no alternative but to direct the trial Court to provide an opportunity to both the parties to lead evidence regarding the date of birth of the accused no.2 and record its finding on the same issue within a specific period.  Until then the order of sentence will have to wait and if the accused is able to prove that he was less than 18 years of age as on 04-02-2001 or 01-04-2001, he would be a juvenile entitled for the benefits under the 2000 Act and will have to be sent to the Juvenile Board for further action as per the said Act.

In one set of cases Supreme Court has found the juvenile guilty of the crime alleged to have been committed by him but he has gone virtually unpunished since this Court quashed the sentence awarded to him. In another set of cases, this Court has taken the view, on the facts of the case that the juvenile is adequately punished for the offence committed by him by serving out some period in detention. In the third set of cases, this Court has remitted the entire case for consideration by the jurisdictional Juvenile Justice Board, both on the innocence or guilt of the juvenile as well as the sentence to be awarded if the juvenile is found guilty. In the fourth set of cases, this Court has examined the case on merits and after having found the juvenile guilty of the offence, remitted the matter to the jurisdictional Juvenile Justice Board on the award of sentence. \n\nIn the present case, the offence was committed by the appellant when the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 was in force. Therefore, only the 'punishments' not greater than those postulated by the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 ought to be awarded to him, A perusal of the 'punishments' provided for under the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 indicate that given the nature of the offence committed by the appellant, advising or admonishing him [clause (a)] is hardly a 'punishment' that can be awarded since it is not at all commensurate with the gravity of the crime. Similarly, considering his age of about 40 years, it is completely illusory to expect the appellant to be released on probation of good conduct, to be placed under the care of any parent, guardian or fit person [clause (b)]. For the same reason, the appellant cannot be released on probation of good conduct under the care of a fit institution [clause (c)] nor can he be sent to a special home under Section 10 of the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986 which is intended to be for the rehabilitation and reformation of delinquent juveniles [clause (d)]. The only realistic punishment that can possibly be awarded to the appellant on the facts of this case is to require him to pay a fine under clause (e) of Section 21(1) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 1986. While dealing with the case of the appellant under the IPC, the fine imposed upon him is only Rs.100/- which is ex facie inadequate punishment considering fact that deceased suffered a dowry death.

                "description": "Criminal P.C. (1973), Ss.41B, 50A, 54 - Juvenile delinquent - Conviction and sentence - Appellant juvenile subjected to trial but later found to be juvenile - Directions issued to Magistrate for taking appropriate measures to prevent recurrence of such situation.\n\nThe Act and the Model Rules clearly constitute an independent code for issues concerning a child or a juvenile, particularly a juvenile in conflict with law. This code is intended to safeguard the rights of the child and a juvenile in conflict with law and to put him in a category separate and distinct from an adult accused of a crime.\n\nKeeping in mind all these standards and safeguards required to be met as per our international obligations, it becomes obligatory for every Magistrate before whom an accused is produced to ascertain, in the first instance or as soon thereafter as may be possible, whether the accused person is an adult or a juvenile in conflict with law. The reason for this, obviously, is to avoid a two-fold difficulty: first, to avoid a juvenile being subjected to procedures under the normal criminal law and de hors the Act and the Rules, and second, a resultant situation, where the \"trial\" of the juvenile is required to be set aside and quashed as having been conducted by a court not having jurisdiction to do so or a juvenile, on being found guilty, going 'unpunished'. This is necessary not only in the best interests of the juvenile but also for the better administration of criminal justice so that the Magistrate or the Sessions Judge (as the case may be) does not waste his time and energy on a \"trial\". \n\nIt must be appreciated by every Magistrate that when an accused is produced before him, it is possible that the prosecution or the investigating officer may be under a mistaken impression that the accused is an adult. If the Magistrate has any iota of doubt about the juvenility of an accused produced before him, Rule 12 provides that a Magistrate may arrive at a prima facie conclusion on the juvenility, on the basis of his physical appearance. In such a case, this prima facie opinion should be recorded by the Magistrate. Thereafter, if custodial remand is necessary, the accused may be sent to jail or a juvenile may be sent to an Observation Home, as the case may be, and the Magistrate should simultaneously order an inquiry, if necessary, for determining the age of the accused. \n\nFurther the procedures laid down in Ss.41-B, 50-A and 54 of Criminal Procedure Code in as much as they are for the benefit of a juvenile or a child, apply with full rigour to an apprehension made of a juvenile in conflict with law under Section 10 of the Act. If these procedures are followed, the probability of a juvenile, on apprehension, being shown as an adult and sent to judicial custody in a jail, will be considerably minimized. If these procedures are followed, as they should be, along with the requirement of a Magistrate to examine the juvenility or otherwise of an accused person brought before him, subjecting a juvenile in conflict with law to a trial by a regular Court may become a thing of the past.           [Para 57,58,59,67]\n\nT.S. Thakur, J. (concurring) :- \n\nThere is no reason why the conviction of the appellant should be interfered with, simply because he is under the 2000 Act a juvenile entitled to the benefit of being referred to the Board for an order under Section 15 of the said Act. There is no gainsaying that even if the appellant had been less than sixteen years of age, on the date of the occurrence, he would have been referred for trial to the Juvenile Court in terms of Section 8 of the 1986 Act. The Juvenile Court would then hold a trial and record a conviction or acquittal depending upon the evidence adduced before it. In an ideal situation a case filed before an ordinary Criminal Court when referred to the Board or Juvenile Court may culminate in a conviction at the hands of the Board also. But law does not countenance a situation where a full-fledged trial and even an appeal ends in a conviction of the accused but the same is set aside without providing for a trial by the Board.

The fundamental principle of the \"reading down\" doctrine can be summarized as follows. Courts must read the legislation literally in the first instance. If on such reading and understanding the vice of unconstitutionality is attracted, the courts must explore whether there has been an unintended legislative omission. If such an intendment can be reasonably implied without undertaking what, unmistakably, would be a legislative exercise, the Act may be read down to save it from unconstitutionality.\n\n1991 supp. (1) SCC 600 Ref.to.     [Para 42]\n\nIn the present case there is no difficulty in understanding the clear and unambiguous meaning of the different provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act. There is no ambiguity, muchless any uncertainty, in the language used to convey what the legislature had intended. All persons below the age of 18 are put in one class/group by the Act to provide a separate scheme of investigation, trial and punishment for offences committed by them. A class of persons is sought to be created who are treated differently. This is being done to further/effectuate the views of the international community which India has shared by being a signatory to the several conventions and treaties.      [Para 43.]\n\nIf the provisions of the Act clearly indicate the legislative intent in the light of the country's international commitments and the same is in conformity with the constitutional requirements, it is not necessary for the Court to understand the legislation in any other manner. In fact, if the Act is plainly read and understood, which we must do, the resultant effect thereof is wholly consistent with Article 14. The Act, therefore, need not be read down, to save it from the vice of unconstitutionality for such unconstitutionality does not exist.                           [Para 45]"

Even if the claim of juvenility is not pressed at trial court it can be pressed for the first time even at High Court or even at Supreme Court. \n\nb) For making such claim the claimant must produce some material which may prima facie satisfy that an inquiry into the claim of juvenility is necessary. Initial burden has to be discharged by the person who claims juvenility. \n\nc) Documents referred to in Rule 12(3)(a)(i) to (iii) shall definitely be sufficient for prima facie satisfaction of the court about the age of the delinquent necessitating further enquiry under Rule 12.\n\nd) Statement recorded under Section 313 of the Cr.P.C is too tentative and may not by itself be sufficient ordinarily to justify or reject the claim of juvenility.\n\ne) Credibility and/or acceptability of the documents like the school leaving certificate or the voters' list, etc obtained after conviction would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case and no hard and fast rule can be prescribed that they must be prima facie accepted or rejected.\n\nf) If such documents prima facie inspire confidence, the court may act upon such documents for the purposes of Section 7A and order an enquiry for determination of the age of the delinquent.\n\ng) An affidavit in support of the claim of juvenility, raised for the first time in appeal or revision or before Supreme Court during the pendency of the matter or after disposal of the case, shall not be sufficient justifying an enquiry to determine the age of such person unless the circumstances of the case are so glaring that satisfy the judicial conscience of the court to order an enquiry into determination of age of the delinquent.\n\nh)The beneficent and salutary provisions contained in Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000, should not defeated by hyper-technical approach. Matters should be considered prima facie on the touchstone of preponderance of probability.\n\ni) Claim of juvenility lacking in credibility or frivolous claim of juvenility or patently absurd or inherently improbable claim of juvenility must be rejected by the court at threshold whenever raised. \n\nThe expression 'any court' in Section 7A is too wide and comprehensive.

Statute requires the Court or the Board only to make an 'inquiry' and in what manner that inquiry has to be conducted is provided in JJ Rules, 2007. The expressions used in Section 7A and Rule 12 are of considerable importance and a reference to them is necessary to understand the true scope and content of those provisions. Section 7A has used the expression \"court shall make an inquiry\", \"take such evidence as may be necessary\" and \"but not an affidavit\". The Court or the Board can accept as evidence something more than an affidavit i.e. the Court or the Board can accept documents, certificates etc. as evidence need not be oral evidence.\t [Para 51]\n\nRule 12 which has to be read along with Section 7A has also used certain expressions which are also to be borne in mind at the point of time when enquiry of juvenility is underway. Rule 12(2) uses the expression \"prima facie\" and \"on the basis of physical appearance\" or \"documents, if available\". Rule 12(3) uses the expression \"by seeking evidence by obtaining\". These expressions in our view re-assert the fact that what is contemplated in Section 7A and Rule 12 is only an inquiry.\t [Para 52]\n\nFurther, the age determination inquiry has to be completed and age be determined within thirty days from the date of making the application; which is also an indication of the manner in which the inquiry has to be conducted and completed. [Para 53]\n\nIn many cases the Court /the J.J. Board while determining the claim of juvenility forget that what they are expected to do is not to conduct an inquiry under Section 2(g) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, but an inquiry under the J.J. Act, following the procedure laid under Rule 12 and not following the procedure laid down under the Code. [Para 58]\n\nConsequently, the procedure to be followed under the J.J.

Only in the absence of any matriculation or equivalent certificates, the court need obtain the date of birth certificate from the school first attended other than a play school. Only in the absence of matriculation or equivalent certificate or the date of birth certificate from the school first attended, the court need obtain the birth certificate given by a corporation or a municipal authority or a panchayat (not an affidavit but certificates or documents). The question of obtaining medical opinion from a duly constituted Medical Board arises only if the above mentioned documents are unavailable. In case exact assessment of the age cannot be done, then the court, for reasons to be recorded, may, if considered necessary, give the benefit to the child or juvenile by considering his or her age on lower side within the margin of one year. \t [Para 60]\n\nOnce the court, following the above mentioned procedure, passes an order; that order shall be the conclusive proof of the age as regards such child or juvenile in conflict with law. It has been made clear in subsection (5) of Rule 12 that no further inquiry shall be conducted by the court or the Board after examining and obtaining the certificate or any other documentary proof after referring to sub-rule (3) of the Rule 12.

This particular opinion would subserve the cause of justice, inasmuch as, the aim and object of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 is to extend the benefit to a juvenile.\t [Para 68]"

Substitution of the words \u2018may direct\u2019 with \u2018shall direct\u2019 in the main provision is to clarify that the provision is mandatory and not directory. Section 64 has to be read harmoniously with the newly added proviso and explanation and also other amendments made vide Act 33 of 2006 in Section 20 and by way of inserting Section 7A in the 2000 Act. The main provision states that where a juvenile in conflict with law is undergoing any sentence of imprisonment at the commencement of the 2000 Act, he shall, in lieu of undergoing the sentence, be sent to a special home or be kept in a fit institution in such manner as the state government thinks fit for the remainder of the period of sentence. Further, the provisions of the 2000 Act are to apply as if the juvenile had been ordered by the Board to be sent to the special home or institution and ordered to be kept under protective care under sub-section (2) of Section 16 of the Act. The proviso states that the state government or the Board, for any adequate and special reasons to be recorded in writing, review the case of the juvenile in conflict with law who is undergoing sentence of imprisonment and who had ceased to be a juvenile on or before the commencement of the 2000 Act and pass appropriate orders. However, it is the explanation which is of extreme significance as it states that in all cases where a juvenile in conflict with law is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment on the date of commencement of the 2000 Act, the juvenile\u2019s case including the issue of juvenility, shall be deemed to be decided in terms of clause (l) to Section 2 and other provisions and rules made under the 2000 Act irrespective of the fact that the juvenile had ceased to be a juvenile. Such juvenile shall be sent to special home or fit institution for the remainder period of his sentence but such sentence shall not exceed the maximum period provided in Section 15 of the 2000 Act. The statute overrules and modifies the sentence awarded, even in decided cases. (Para 13)\n\tTherefore Supreme Court in appeal can decide and determine the question of juvenility of 'S', notwithstanding the fact that 'S' was not entitled to the benefit of being a juvenile on the date of the offence, under the 1986 Act, and had turned an adult when the 2000 Act was enforced. As 'S' was less than 18 years of age on the date of commission of offence on 11.12.1981, he is entitled to be treated as a juvenile and be given benefit as per the 2000 Act. Thus Supreme Court upheld conviction of 'S', and set aside the sentence of life imprisonment. and remitted the matter to the jurisdiction of the Board for passing appropriate order/directions under Section 15 of the 2000 Act including the question of determination and payment of appropriate quantum of fine and the compensation to be awarded to the family of the deceased.

As per Section 19(2), the Board only ensures the implementation of the statutory right by ordering removal of records. The High Court is as much under an obligation to uphold the right, as is the Board. On contrary Section 6(2) specifically reiterates the jurisdiction of the High Courts as well as Sessions Courts to pass all orders which the Juvenile Justice Board (JJB) stands statutorily empowered to do so. The High Court therefore also empowered to pass orders for removal of disqualification attaching as a result of the conviction as well as destruction of records which the JJB is statutorily mandated to do under Section 19 of the JJ Act. This situation could arise not only in appeals against conviction by the criminal courts in serious offences which are placed before the Division Bench of the High Court as in the present case, but could very well arise in any appeal against the convictions as well as criminal revision before the learned Single Judge. Given the enunciation of law in Hari Ram v. State of Rajasthan & Anr., the plea can be raised in revisions and appeals before the Sessions Courts as well . The dicta laid down by the Supreme Court and the statutory position crystallized in the judgment would apply to all appeals and revisions before the Single Judge of the High Court as well as in all proceedings before the Sessions Courts as well.

Penal Code (1860), S.302.\n\nWhenever there is either doubt as regards the age of the person arrested or apprehended by the police on account of his involvement in any offence or when the age factor of such person is described by the person arrested, it would be the duty of the police officer arresting the person to ascertain the age either by following various methods provided under the said Act and Rules framed thereunder and, if not possible that by way of obtaining the medical opinion in that regard. Undoubtedly, if the medical examination is not possible immediately on apprehension of the person, such information should be obtained within a period of 24 hours from the time of his apprehension and in case of impossibility to do so, the reason therefor to be recorded in writing and the same should be obtained at the earliest possible. But under no circumstances the provisions of the said Act and Rules framed thereunder which are essentially a beneficial legislation for the children and juvenile should be allowed to be flouted or frustrated in any manner. As observed above, the application for remand though disclosed the age of 19 years, no efforts were made by the investigating agency to ascertain the exact age of the petitioner at any point of time, either at the time of obtaining the remand or even thereafter. Unfortunately, the learned Magistrate before whom the petitioner was produced requesting for remand in the matter, also did not appear to have applied his mind, neither followed the statutory provisions comprised under the said Act nor the ruling of the Apex Court clearly requiring the Courts dealing with such persons to be more sensitive and careful to ensure the proper implementation of the beneficial legislation comprised under the said Act and the Rules made thereunder. [Para 22,23,24]\n\nEvidently, it was as long back as in 1982 that the Apex Court had in no uncertain terms required the Magistrates and the Courts dealing with the person who appear to be of the age of 21 years or below to ascertain the age of such person before proceeding to deal with such person in relation to the offence for which he is charged or accused of. Undoubtedly, the said decision was reported in the year 1984, nearly 16 years prior to the date of incident in the case in hand.  It is rather unfortunate that the Magistrate, in the case in hand, did not bother to act in accordance with the mandate issued by the Apex Court.   [Para 25]\n\nSerious lapses on the part of the investigating agency, the learned Metropolitan Magistrate and the Addl. Sessions Judge, have not only caused prejudice to the petitioner but also resulted in wastage of valuable public time apart from non-compliance of the mandatory provisions by the law enforcing agency.  It is, therefore, necessary to give necessary directions to all the Courts below as well as the police machinery of the State to ensure henceforth due implementation and enforcement of the provisions of the said Act and the said Rules without fail and to ensure that the object of the said beneficial legislation is not allowed to be frustrated or defeated in any manner.  Proper care is expected from all such agencies and the institutions and the Government to ensure that necessary effort is made to take appropriate and prompt steps to provide necessary infrastructure and opportunity for reformation of juvenile and not to allow them to turn hardened criminals. 2004 ALL MR (Cri) 2137 and 2002 ALL MR (Cri) 713 (S.C.) - Rel.on.\t [Para 27]"

Act.\n\n\tSection 12(1) of the Juvenile Justice Act deals with a situation where a child in conflict with law is apprehended or detained by the police or appears or brought before the Board. It deals with the procedure to be followed after apprehending a child in conflict with law. When a child in conflict with law is apprehended or detained or appears or brought before the Board, the provision contained in Section 12(1) of the Act comes into play. The expression \"notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974)\" in Section 12(1) of the Act is applicable to granting of bail to a child who is alleged to be in conflict with law after his apprehension or detention by the police or appearance or production before the Board. It does not deal with a situation before apprehending a child in conflict with law. In other words, this provision does not deal with a situation before the apprehension or detention of a child in conflict with law by the police or his appearance or production before the Board. Therefore, the provision contained in Section 12(1) of the Act does not take away the jurisdiction of the High Court or the Court of Session under Section 438 of the Code even by implication.\n\n\tThere is no provision in the Juvenile Justice Act which either expressly or by necessary implication excludes the applicability of Section 438 of the Code which provides for granting anticipatory bail. The Act does not contain any special provision dealing with granting of anticipatory bail to a child in conflict with law. Where no special provision is made under the Act with regard to any particular matter, the provision contained in the Code in that regard shall be applicable. The Act does not contain any provision which excludes the general application of the provisions of the Code as such.

(1973), Ss.437, 439 - Bail to juvenile - Application to be dealt with only under provisions of JJ Act - Provisions u/Ss.437 and 439 of CrPC would stand excluded.\n\n\tA conjoint analysis of the provisions contained in Sections 437 and 439 of the Code viz a viz Sections 8, 10 and 12 of the Act, 2015 would discern that while there are certain general guidelines under Sections 437 & 439 of the Code, power in respect of grant of bail to a juvenile is more liberal in the nature of command under Section 12 (1) that whenever an apparent juvenile alleged to have committed a bailable or non-bailable offence is detained by the police or appears or brought before a Board, such person shall, notwithstanding anything contained in the Code or in any other law for the time being in force, be released on bail with or without surety or placed under the supervision of a probation officer or under the care of any fit person. The only rider for not releasing the apparent juvenile is that whenever there appears reasonable grounds for believing that the release is likely to bring that person (Juvenile) into association with any known criminal or expose the said person to moral, physical or psychological danger or his release would defeat the ends of justice, the Board shall record the reasons for denying the bail and circumstances that led to such a decision. This rider as contained in proviso to Section 12 (1) requires the Board to record reasons for denying the bail. It would mean that ordinarily the bail is to be allowed to a juvenile. The denial being exceptional on certain reasons to be recorded by the Board as provided in the proviso. This special provision is not contained under Section 439 of the Code.\n\n\tIt is also to notice that under the statutory scheme of the Act of 2015, a comprehensive provision has been made as to how a child in conflict with law has to be dealt with when he is apprehended and not released on bail. The said provisions are contained under sub-sections (2), (3) & (4) of Section 12 of the Act of 2015. Under the said provision, on denial of bail, such person (Juvenile) has to be kept in observation home in the manner prescribed until he is brought before the Board. It is also provided that when a child in conflict with law is unable to fulfill the conditions of bail within 7 days of the bail order, such child shall be produced before the Board for modification of the conditions of bail.\n\n\tThe provisions pari materia to this are not available under Section 439 of the Code, therefore, on denial of bail under Section 439 of the Code or when the bail is allowed but the juvenile is not able to satisfy the conditions of bail, it is not mandated under the Code that such child shall be produced before the Board for modification of the conditions of bail. In the absence of this provision either in case of denial of bail or even when the bail is allowed under Section 439 of the Code, but the conditions of bail are not satisfied, the juvenile would be deprived of his statutory right under Section 12 (2), (3) & (4) of the Act of 2015. It is precisely for this reason Section 12 of the Act of 2015 provides for overriding effect due to use of non-obstante clause, therefore, the post arrest bail of juvenile in conflict with law is required to be dealt with under the special provision contained in Section 12 of the Act of 2015 and to the said extent it will exclude operation of Section 437 and/or Section 439 of the Code.\n\n\tTherefore, Section 12 of the Act of 2015 having included 'notwithstanding anything contained in the Code or in any other law for the time being in force, the provisions as contained in the Code in respect of grant of bail under Sections 437 and 439 of the Code has to be excluded and shall not apply while considering the juvenile's right to be enlarged on bail for which a specific provision has been made under Section 12 and thereafter the appellate and revisional powers of the Court of Sessions and the High Court as contained in Sections 101 and 102 of the Act of 2015, as the case may be.\n\n2005 Cri L J 3271 Overruled. \t\t\t\t [Para 7,9,10,15]"

Act provides for grant of bail after juvenile is detained or apprehended - Situation before that stage is not covered by S.12 - Hence, even by implication, provision u/S.12 of J.J. Act does not take away jurisdiction of HC or Sessions Court to grant anticipatory bail u/S.438 CrPC.\n\n\tSection 12(1) of the Juvenile Justice Act deals with a situation where a child in conflict with law is apprehended or detained by the police or appears or brought before the Board. It deals with the procedure to be followed after apprehending a child in conflict with law. When a child in conflict with law is apprehended or detained or appears or brought before the Board, the provision contained in Section 12(1) of the Act comes into play. The expression \"notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (2 of 1974)\" in Section 12(1) of the Act is applicable to granting of bail to a child who is alleged to be in conflict with law after his apprehension or detention by the police or appearance or production before the Board. It does not deal with a situation before apprehending a child in conflict with law. In other words, this provision does not deal with a situation before the apprehension or detention of a child in conflict with law by the police or his appearance or production before the Board. Therefore, the provision contained in Section 12(1) of the Act does not take away the jurisdiction of the High Court or the Court of Session under Section 438 of the Code even by implication.\n\n\tThere is no provision in the Juvenile Justice Act which either expressly or by necessary implication excludes the applicability of Section 438 of the Code which provides for granting anticipatory bail. The Act does not contain any special provision dealing with granting of anticipatory bail to a child in conflict with law. Where no special provision is made under the Act with regard to any particular matter, the provision contained in the Code in that regard shall be applicable. The Act does not contain any provision which excludes the general application of the provisions of the Code as such. Wherever the legislature intended to give overriding effect to the statutory scheme of the Act over the provisions of general application contained in the Code, it has been specifically provided so. \n\n\tThe upshot of the discussion above is that an application for anticipatory bail under Section 438 of the Code at the instance of a child in conflict with law is maintainable before the High Court or the Court of Session. \n\nMANU/TN/1491/2017 Dissented from.

No consideration of this principle is reflected in the order and thus, the illegality is incurable and goes to the root of the matter;\n\n(vii)\tcopy of the order passed under Section 15 of the Act was not provided to the juvenile of thus breaching the mandate of Rule 10A of the Model Rules of 2016;\n\n(viii)\tthat the under-trial child was sent to the District Jail, Pratapgarh vide order dated 19.08.2017 and thus, was treated in gross contravention of the mandate of Section 19(3) read with Section 46 of the Act of 2015 thereby vitiating the entire proceedings before the Sessions Court.\n\n(ix)\tThe child suffered incarceration from 16.05.2016 to 11.02.2019 on which date this Court suspended the sentences awarded to her and thus, she has undergone a custodial period of nearly two years and seven months in a prison which course of action is totally prohibited by law.\t [Para 29,30]"

It states that the pending proceedings shall be continued in that Board or court as if the 2015 Act had not been passed. the use of the word \u2018any\u2019 before the board or court in Section 25 of the 2015 Act, would mean and include any court including the appellate court or a court before which the revision petition is pending. This is also apparent from the use of the words \u2018a child alleged or found to be in conflict with law\u2019. The word \u2018found\u2019 is used in past-tense and would apply in cases where an order/judgment has been passed. The word \u2018alleged\u2019 would refer to those proceedings where no final order has been passed and the matter is sub-judice. Further, Section 25 of the 2015 Act applies to proceedings before the board or the court and as noticed above, it would include any court, including the appellate court or the court where the revision petition is pending. In the context of Section 25, the expression \u2018court\u2019 is not restricted to mean a civil court which has the jurisdiction in the matter of \u2018adoption\u2019 and \u2018guardianship\u2019 in terms of clause (23) to Section 2 of the 2015 Act [\u201c(23) - \u201ccourt\u201d means a civil court, which has jurisdiction in matters of adoption and guardianship and may include the District Court, Family Court and City Civil Courts\u2019;\u201d]. The definition clause is applicable unless the context otherwise requires. In case of Section 25, the legislature is obviously not referring to a civil court as the section deals with pending proceedings in respect of a child alleged or found to be in conflict with law, which cannot be proceedings pending before a civil court. Since the Act of 2015 protects and affirms the application of the 2000 Act to all pending proceedings, it cannot be said that the legislative intent of the 2015 Act is to the contrary, that is, to apply the 2015 Act to all pending proceedings.\n\tConsequently, in light of Section 6 of the General Clauses Act read with Section 25 of the 2015 Act, an accused cannot be denied his right to be treated as a juvenile when he was less than eighteen years of age at the time of commission of the offence, a right which he acquired and has fructified under the 2000 Act, even if the offence was committed prior to enforcement of the 2000 Act on 01.04.2001. In terms of Section 25 of the 2015 Act, 2000 Act would continue to apply and govern the proceedings which were pending when the 2015 Act was enforced. (Paras 17, 18)"

The Japanese Act, on the other hand, applies in a situation where carriage of goods by a ship is either from a loading Port or from a discharging Port, either of which is located outside Japan. Therefore, Japanese Act will clearly be applicable in the instant case.  The High Court applied the provisions of the Indian law.  As the originating port is outside India, Section 2 of the Indian Act will have no application. High Court misread the said provision.  Appeal allowed.  [Para 17]"

The said order which is passed is appealable and an appeal can be preferred before the Tribunal and the order passed by the Tribunal attains finality under section 7N. The said order passed under Section 7A can also be reviewed under Section 7B or redetermined under Section 7C and, lastly, for non-payment of the said amount, the employer can be prosecuted and penalty can be imposed under section 14 and recovery also can be made under the procedure laid down under Section 8. Therefore, though the Officer who passes an order under section 7A is not termed as a \"Judge\", he falls within the definition of section 19 of the IPC as well as section 2 of the Judges (Protection) Act, 1985 since he is empowered by law to determine the amount and decide the dispute and the proceeding is legal proceeding in view of section 7A(2) which in terms lays down that the said inquiry shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding and the Officer shall have all the powers which are vested in Court under the CPC for trying the suit and also that the said inquiry is deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of Sections 193 and 228 for the purpose of Section 196 of the IPC. The proceeding, therefore, is a legal proceeding and the order which is passed is a definitive order and if the order is confirmed in appeal, it attains finality and on the basis of the said order recovery can be made and the mode of recovery is similar to the execution of decree as laid down under section 51 of the IPC which is evident from the provisions of section 8A and 8B.\n\nThis being the position, the Officer who passes an order under Section 7A is entitled to get the protection as envisaged under section 77 of the Indian Penal Code and section 3(1) of the Judges (Protection) Act, 1985.\n\n2001 (4) MPHT 58, AIR 1963 SC 677.

However, under Section 2 of the said Act, such a claimant has no power to alienate the right, title or interest in the family property. Under Section 4(b) of the Act the property thus obtained by her as a widow would return to the legal heirs of her husband upon her death. She therefore, would have only a limited interest in the properties during her life time. Besides, Section 6 of the Act provides as follows:- \" Where the net annual income of the share of husband of the widow is more than Rs.1200/-, the share of her husband shall be deemed to be only such property as would yield an income of Rs.1200/-.\"   Essentially this Act is a legislation to prevent vagrancy. The object of the Act as stated therein shows that it would elevate the Hindu Widow to a satisfactory level, which until then she was not entitled to. But that was all. Thus under that Act the right to partition was only a limited right. The Hindu widow could therefore, claim maintenance to the extent of Rs.1200/- p.a. or a right to partition. This was without the right of alienation and for her life time only.  The original Plaintiff's maintenance was far larger than the ceiling limit under the Act since she was given Rs.1250/- per month as against the ceiling of Rs.1200/-per annum. Hence, independent of the question of the applicability of the Act to the estate of sovereign, she had no case to seek partition and that too with any right of alienation and for her share to devolve on her heirs.\n\nThus, there was an option to be exercised by the original Plaintiff under the Jamkhandi Act between maintenance and partition. She opted to have maintenance, which is seen by the fact of its acceptance by her.\n\nThe claim by the original Plaintiff for \u00bcth share and by the present Plaintiffs for \u00bd share is therefore rightly rejected.\t  [Para 39,40,41]"

Overruled.\n\nPer Sema, J. (for himself and on behalf of N. Santosh Hegde, S. N. Variava and B. P. Singh, JJ.) :- The reckoning date for the determination of the age of the juvenile is the date of an occurrence and not the date when he is produced before the authority or in the court.\t [Para 37]\n\nSub-section (1) of Section 2 of 2000 Act defines \"juvenile in conflict with law\" means a juvenile who is alleged to have committed an offence. The notable distinction between the definitions of 1986 Act and 2000 Act is that in 1986 Act \"Juvenile in conflict with law\" is absent. The definition of delinquent juvenile in 1986 Act as noticed above is referable to an offence said to have been committed by him. It is the date of offence that he was in conflict with law. When a juvenile is produced before the competent authority and or court he has not committed an offence on that date, but he was brought before the authority for the alleged offence which he has been found to have committed. What was implicit in 1986 Act has been made explicit in 2000 Act.  [Para 12]\n\nIt cannot be said that the word 'is' used in S.32 of 1986 Act suggests that for determination of age of juvenile the date of production would be reckoning date as the inquiry with regard to his age begins from the date he is brought before the Court and not otherwise. The definition of delinquent juvenile means a juvenile who has been found to have committed an offence. The word 'is' employed in S.32 is referable to a juvenile who is said to have committed an offence on the date of the occurrence. The word \"is\" has been used in more than one place in S.18 also. S.18 provides for bail and custody. Often than not, an offender is arrested immediately after an offence is alleged to have been committed or sometime even arrested on the spot. [Para 14,15]\n\nThe legislative intendment underlying Sections 3 and 26 read with the preamble, aims and objects of the Act is clearly discernible. A conjoint reading of the Sections, preamble, aims and objects of the Act leaves no matter of doubt that the legislature intended to provide protection, treatment, development and rehabilitation of neglected or delinquent juveniles and for the adjudication thereof. The Act being a piece of social legislation is meant for the protection of infants who commit criminal offences and, therefore, such provisions should be liberally and meaningfully construed so as to advance the object of the Act.   [Para 19]\n\nPer S. B. Sinha, J. (Concurring) :-\tThe field covered by the Act includes a situation leading to juvenile delinquency vis-a-vis commission of an offence. In such an event he is to be provided the post-delinquency care and for the said purpose the date when delinquency took place would be the relevant date. It must, therefore, be held that the relevant date for determining the age of the juvenile would be one on which the offence has been committed and not when he is produced in Court.   [Para 89]\n\nOnly because his age is to be determined in a case of dispute by the competent Court or the Board in terms of S.26 of the Act, the same would not mean that the relevant date thereof would be the one on which he is produced before the Board. If such an argument is accepted, the same would result in absurdity as, in a given case, it would be open to the police authorities not to produce him before the Board before he ceases to be juvenile. If he is produced after he ceases to be juvenile, it may not be necessary for the Board to send him in the protective custody or release him on bail as a result whereof he would be sent to the judicial or police custody which would defeat the very purpose for which the Act had been enacted. Law cannot be applied in an uncertain position. Furthermore, the right to have a fair trial strictly in terms of the Act which would include procedural safeguard is a fundamental right of the juvenile. A proceeding against a juvenile must conform to the provisions of the Act.  [Para 81]"

Substitution of the words \u2018may direct\u2019 with \u2018shall direct\u2019 in the main provision is to clarify that the provision is mandatory and not directory. Section 64 has to be read harmoniously with the newly added proviso and explanation and also other amendments made vide Act 33 of 2006 in Section 20 and by way of inserting Section 7A in the 2000 Act. The main provision states that where a juvenile in conflict with law is undergoing any sentence of imprisonment at the commencement of the 2000 Act, he shall, in lieu of undergoing the sentence, be sent to a special home or be kept in a fit institution in such manner as the state government thinks fit for the remainder of the period of sentence. Further, the provisions of the 2000 Act are to apply as if the juvenile had been ordered by the Board to be sent to the special home or institution and ordered to be kept under protective care under sub-section (2) of Section 16 of the Act. The proviso states that the state government or the Board, for any adequate and special reasons to be recorded in writing, review the case of the juvenile in conflict with law who is undergoing sentence of imprisonment and who had ceased to be a juvenile on or before the commencement of the 2000 Act and pass appropriate orders. However, it is the explanation which is of extreme significance as it states that in all cases where a juvenile in conflict with law is undergoing a sentence of imprisonment on the date of commencement of the 2000 Act, the juvenile\u2019s case including the issue of juvenility, shall be deemed to be decided in terms of clause (l) to Section 2 and other provisions and rules made under the 2000 Act irrespective of the fact that the juvenile had ceased to be a juvenile. Such juvenile shall be sent to special home or fit institution for the remainder period of his sentence but such sentence shall not exceed the maximum period provided in Section 15 of the 2000 Act. The statute overrules and modifies the sentence awarded, even in decided cases. (Para 13)\n\tTherefore Supreme Court in appeal can decide and determine the question of juvenility of 'S', notwithstanding the fact that 'S' was not entitled to the benefit of being a juvenile on the date of the offence, under the 1986 Act, and had turned an adult when the 2000 Act was enforced. As 'S' was less than 18 years of age on the date of commission of offence on 11.12.1981, he is entitled to be treated as a juvenile and be given benefit as per the 2000 Act. Thus Supreme Court upheld conviction of 'S', and set aside the sentence of life imprisonment. and remitted the matter to the jurisdiction of the Board for passing appropriate order/directions under Section 15 of the 2000 Act including the question of determination and payment of appropriate quantum of fine and the compensation to be awarded to the family of the deceased.

For, there is hardly any difference in so far as the issue of minority is concerned, between a child in conflict with law, and a child who is a victim of crime. Therefore,  it would be just and appropriate to apply Rule 12 of the 2007 Rules, to determine the age of the prosecutrix. The manner of determining age conclusively, has been expressed in sub-rule (3) of Rule 12. Under the aforesaid provision, the age of a child is ascertained, by adopting the first available basis, out of a number of options postulated in Rule 12(3). If, in the scheme of options under Rule 12(3), an option is expressed in a preceding clause, it has overriding effect over an option expressed in a subsequent clause. The highest rated option available, would conclusively determine the age of a minor. In the scheme of Rule 12(3), matriculation (or equivalent) certificate of the concerned child, is the highest rated option. In case, the said certificate is available, no other evidence can be relied upon. Only in the absence of the said certificate, Rule 12(3), envisages consideration of the date of birth entered, in the school first attended by the child. In case such an entry of date of birth is available, the date of birth depicted therein is liable to be treated as final and conclusive, and no other material is to be relied upon. Only in the absence of such entry, Rule 12(3) postulates reliance on a birth certificate issued by a corporation or a municipal authority or a panchayat. Yet again, if such a certificate is available, then no other material whatsoever is to be taken into consideration, for determining the age of the child concerned, as the said certificate would conclusively determine the age of the child. It is only in the absence of any of the aforesaid, that Rule 12(3) postulates the determination of age of the concerned child, on the basis of medical opinion.\n\n2012 ALL SCR 1183 Disting.\t     [Para 20]"

As per Rule 12(3), the Court is required to first seek evidence by obtaining the specified certificate in sub-clauses (i) to (iii) of Clause (a) and in absence thereof seek medical opinion from a duly constituted Medical Board. Further, if exact assessment of the age cannot be done, the Court for the reasons to be recorded, may, if considered necessary, give benefit to the child or juvenile by considering his/her age on lower side within the margin of one year. Furthermore, while passing order in such cases, the \"Court\" is expected to record a finding in respect of the age of the person. Finding so recorded by the \"Court\" alone can be conclusive proof of the age as regards such child or juvenile in conflict with law.  [Para 6]"

                "description": "Claim of juvenility - Admission register of Higher Secondary School where appellant first studied was produced by Principal of school - Is a relevant piece of evidence - There was nothing to refute or rebut factum of date of birth entered in school admission register - Said document conclusively establish that appellant was juvenile on date of incident - Order of Trial Court not accepting school admission register and making fishing inquiry to determine basis on which date of birth was entered in school register - Is not proper. \n\nThe procedure to be followed under the J.J. Act in conducting an inquiry is the procedure laid down in that statute itself i.e. Rule 12 of the 2007 Rules. \"Age determination inquiry\" contemplated under section 7A of the Act r/w Rule 12 of the 2007 Rules enables the court to seek evidence and in that process, the court can obtain the matriculation or equivalent certificates, if available. Only in the absence of any matriculation or equivalent certificates, the court needs to obtain the date of birth certificate from the school first attended other than a play school. Only in the absence of matriculation or equivalent certificate or the date of birth certificate from the school first attended, the court need obtains to the birth certificate given by a corporation or a municipal authority or a panchayat (not an affidavit but certificates or documents). The question of obtaining medical opinion from a duly constituted Medical Board arises only if the above mentioned documents are unavailable. In case exact assessment of the age cannot be done, then the court, for reasons to be recorded, may, if considered necessary, give the benefit to the child or juvenile by considering his or her age on lower side within the margin of one year. Once the court, following the above mentioned procedures, passes an order; that order shall be the conclusive proof of the age as regards such child or juvenile in conflict with law. It has been made clear in sub-section (5) or Rule 12 that no further inquiry shall be conducted by the court or the Board after examining and obtaining the certificate or any other documentary proof after referring to sub-rule (3) of the Rule 12. Further, Section 49 of the J.J. Act also draws a presumption of the age of the Juvenility on its determination. Age determination inquiry contemplated under the JJ Act and Rules has nothing to do with an enquiry under other legislations, like entry in service, retirement, promotion etc. There may be situations where the entry made in the matriculation or equivalent certificates, date of birth certificate from the school first attended and even the birth certificate given by a Corporation or a Municipal Authority or a Panchayat may not be correct. But Court, J.J. Board or a Committee functioning under the J.J. Act is not expected to conduct such a roving enquiry and to go behind those certificates to examine the correctness of those documents, kept during the normal course of business. Only in cases where those documents or certificates are found to be fabricated or manipulated, the Court, the J.J. Board or the Committee need to go for medical report for age determination. In the present case the court examined the question of juvenility of the appellant as if it was conducting a criminal trial or inquiry under the Code. Notice was issued on the application filed by the juvenile and in response to that State as well as the widow of the victim filed objection to the application. The father of the appellant was cross examined as PW 1 and was permitted to produce several documents including the mark sheet of class five  mark sheet of class eight mark sheet of Intermediate Education Board, MP, horoscope etc. Further, the mother of the appellant was examined as PW 4, Transfer Certificate was produced on the side of the appellant. Noticing that the parents of the appellant were attempting to show a lesser age of the child so as to escape from the criminal case, the Court took steps to conduct ossification test. Held, that the admission register in the school in which the candidate first attended is a relevant piece of evidence of the date of birth. The reasoning that the parents could have entered a wrong date of birth in the admission register hence not a correct date of birth is equal to thinking that parents would do so in anticipation that child would commit a crime in future and, in that situation, they could successfully raise a claim of juvenility. Thus the appellant has successfully established his juvenility on the date of occurrence of the crime i.e. 19.10.2008 on which date he was aged only 17 years 11 months 25 days and therefore sentence award to him would be set aside.

In case exact assessment of the age cannot be done, the Court or the Board or, as the case may be, the Committee, for the reasons to be recorded by them, may, if considered necessary, give benefit to the child or juvenile by considering his/her age on lower side within the margin of one year.     [Para 14]\n\nGoing by sub-rule 3(a)(ii) of aforesaid Rule 12, the date of birth certificate from the school (other than a play school) first attended, comes at the second stage in the order of priority for consideration to ascertain the age of accused claiming to be a juvenile. In the case on hand, the appellant does not claim to be a matriculate. Therefore, the question of matriculation or equivalent certificate and its availability does not arise. The present claim as a juvenile is based on the School Leaving Certificate issued by the school in which the appellant stated to have studied up to 5th class. As per the said certificate, the date of birth recorded in the school admission register and the corresponding entry in the School Leaving Certificate was 01.12.1981. The appellant stated to have joined the school on 01.08.1989 and left the school after subsequently completing his 5th standard on 01.07.1992. The correctness of the said certificate was examined by the Court below as directed by Supreme Court. The Principal/Head Master of the School also verified the admission register. The counterfoil of the said School Leaving Certificate is placed before Court. A perusal of the report also discloses that the certificate was genuine, that the date of birth record therein has been found to be correct and once the said position could be ascertained based on the above report, applying Rule 12 (3) as well as sub-rules (4) and (5) the said Rule read along with Section 7A of the Act the appellant on 11.03.1998 was 16 years 3 months and 10 days old. Thus on basis of the report of the District and sessions judge, the appellant was below 18 years of age on the date of commission of offence and the Juvenile Justice Act would apply in full force in his case also. While upholding the conviction imposed on the appellant, the Supreme Court set aside the sentence imposed on him and direct that he be released forthwith, if not required in any other case.

                "description": "Criminal P.C. (1973), Ss.41B, 50A, 54 - Juvenile delinquent - Conviction and sentence - Appellant juvenile subjected to trial but later found to be juvenile - Directions issued to Magistrate for taking appropriate measures to prevent recurrence of such situation.\n\nThe Act and the Model Rules clearly constitute an independent code for issues concerning a child or a juvenile, particularly a juvenile in conflict with law. This code is intended to safeguard the rights of the child and a juvenile in conflict with law and to put him in a category separate and distinct from an adult accused of a crime.\n\nKeeping in mind all these standards and safeguards required to be met as per our international obligations, it becomes obligatory for every Magistrate before whom an accused is produced to ascertain, in the first instance or as soon thereafter as may be possible, whether the accused person is an adult or a juvenile in conflict with law. The reason for this, obviously, is to avoid a two-fold difficulty: first, to avoid a juvenile being subjected to procedures under the normal criminal law and de hors the Act and the Rules, and second, a resultant situation, where the \"trial\" of the juvenile is required to be set aside and quashed as having been conducted by a court not having jurisdiction to do so or a juvenile, on being found guilty, going 'unpunished'. This is necessary not only in the best interests of the juvenile but also for the better administration of criminal justice so that the Magistrate or the Sessions Judge (as the case may be) does not waste his time and energy on a \"trial\". \n\nIt must be appreciated by every Magistrate that when an accused is produced before him, it is possible that the prosecution or the investigating officer may be under a mistaken impression that the accused is an adult. If the Magistrate has any iota of doubt about the juvenility of an accused produced before him, Rule 12 provides that a Magistrate may arrive at a prima facie conclusion on the juvenility, on the basis of his physical appearance. In such a case, this prima facie opinion should be recorded by the Magistrate. Thereafter, if custodial remand is necessary, the accused may be sent to jail or a juvenile may be sent to an Observation Home, as the case may be, and the Magistrate should simultaneously order an inquiry, if necessary, for determining the age of the accused. \n\nFurther the procedures laid down in Ss.41-B, 50-A and 54 of Criminal Procedure Code in as much as they are for the benefit of a juvenile or a child, apply with full rigour to an apprehension made of a juvenile in conflict with law under Section 10 of the Act. If these procedures are followed, the probability of a juvenile, on apprehension, being shown as an adult and sent to judicial custody in a jail, will be considerably minimized. If these procedures are followed, as they should be, along with the requirement of a Magistrate to examine the juvenility or otherwise of an accused person brought before him, subjecting a juvenile in conflict with law to a trial by a regular Court may become a thing of the past.           [Para 57,58,59,67]\n\nT.S. Thakur, J. (concurring) :- \n\nThere is no reason why the conviction of the appellant should be interfered with, simply because he is under the 2000 Act a juvenile entitled to the benefit of being referred to the Board for an order under Section 15 of the said Act. There is no gainsaying that even if the appellant had been less than sixteen years of age, on the date of the occurrence, he would have been referred for trial to the Juvenile Court in terms of Section 8 of the 1986 Act. The Juvenile Court would then hold a trial and record a conviction or acquittal depending upon the evidence adduced before it. In an ideal situation a case filed before an ordinary Criminal Court when referred to the Board or Juvenile Court may culminate in a conviction at the hands of the Board also. But law does not countenance a situation where a full-fledged trial and even an appeal ends in a conviction of the accused but the same is set aside without providing for a trial by the Board.

S. Thakur, J. :-\n\nRule 12(3) of the Rules makes only three certificates relevant. These are enumerated in Sub-Rule 3(a)(i) to (iii) of the Rule which reads as under:\n\n\"(3)a(i) the matriculation or equivalent certificates, if available; and in the absence whereof;\n\n(ii) the date of birth certificate from the school (other than a play school) first attended; and in the absence whereof; \n\n(iii) the birth certificate given by a corporation or a municipal authority or a panchayat;\n\nNon-production of the above certificates or any one of them is not, however, fatal to the claim of juvenility, for Sub-Rule 3(b) to Rule 12 makes a provision for determination of the question on the basis of the medical examination of the accused in the 'absence' of the certificates.\n\nThe expression 'absence' appearing in the provision is not defined under the Act or the Rules.\n\nIt is axiomatic that the use of the expression and the context in which the same has been used strongly suggests that 'absence' of the documents mentioned in Rule 12(3) (a)(i) to (iii) may be either because the same do not exist or the same cannot be produced by the person relying upon them. Mere non-production may not, therefore, disentitle the accused of the benefit of the Act nor can it tantamount to deliberate non-production, giving rise to an adverse inference unless the Court is in the peculiar facts and circumstances of a case of the opinion that the nonproduction is deliberate or intended to either mislead the Court or suppress the truth.\n\nIt is in this class of cases that the court may have to exercise its powers and discretion with a certain amount of insight into the realities of life. One of such realities is that illiteracy and crime have a close nexus though one may not be directly proportional to the other.\n\nThe Court would, therefore, in each case weigh the relevant factors, insist upon filing of better affidavits if the need so arises, and even direct, any additional information considered relevant including information regarding the age of the parents, the age of siblings and the like, to be furnished before it decides on a case to case basis whether or not an enquiry under Section 7A ought to be conducted. It will eventually depend on how the court evaluates such material for a prima facie conclusion that the Court may or may not direct an enquiry.         [Para 38,44]"

Statute requires the Court or the Board only to make an 'inquiry' and in what manner that inquiry has to be conducted is provided in JJ Rules, 2007. The expressions used in Section 7A and Rule 12 are of considerable importance and a reference to them is necessary to understand the true scope and content of those provisions. Section 7A has used the expression \"court shall make an inquiry\", \"take such evidence as may be necessary\" and \"but not an affidavit\". The Court or the Board can accept as evidence something more than an affidavit i.e. the Court or the Board can accept documents, certificates etc. as evidence need not be oral evidence.\t [Para 51]\n\nRule 12 which has to be read along with Section 7A has also used certain expressions which are also to be borne in mind at the point of time when enquiry of juvenility is underway. Rule 12(2) uses the expression \"prima facie\" and \"on the basis of physical appearance\" or \"documents, if available\". Rule 12(3) uses the expression \"by seeking evidence by obtaining\".

                "description": "Age determination inquiry - Will be conclusive only if procedure prescribed under Rule 12 is followed - Meaning thereby, all matters that have been decided not on parameters of said Rule, are open to further inquiry to be conducted by Court or Board after examining and obtaining certificate referred to sub-rule (3) of Rule 12.\n\n\"Age determination inquiry\" contemplated under section 7A of the Act r/w Rule 12 of the 2007 Rules enables the court to seek evidence and in that process, the court can obtain the matriculation or equivalent certificates, if available. Only in the absence of any matriculation or equivalent certificates, the court need obtain the date of birth certificate from the school first attended other than a play school. Only in the absence of matriculation or equivalent certificate or the date of birth certificate from the school first attended, the court need obtain the birth certificate given by a corporation or a municipal authority or a panchayat (not an affidavit but certificates or documents). The question of obtaining medical opinion from a duly constituted Medical Board arises only if the above mentioned documents are unavailable. In case exact assessment of the age cannot be done, then the court, for reasons to be recorded, may, if considered necessary, give the benefit to the child or juvenile by considering his or her age on lower side within the margin of one year. \t [Para 60]\n\nOnce the court, following the above mentioned procedure, passes an order; that order shall be the conclusive proof of the age as regards such child or juvenile in conflict with law. It has been made clear in subsection (5) of Rule 12 that no further inquiry shall be conducted by the court or the Board after examining and obtaining the certificate or any other documentary proof after referring to sub-rule (3) of the Rule 12. Further, Section 49 of the J.J. Act also draws a presumption of the age of the Juvenility on its determination.\t [Para 61]\n\nThe scheme of the Act would thus clearly reflect that once Section 7-A has been introduced under The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000, thereafter in all the matter that come up before the Court therein either on application moved by the delinquent or on suo moto basis, the Courts are obligated to make an inquiry under the provisions that are provided under Rule 12 of 2007 Rules. All matters that have been decided not on the parameters of the The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 and The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules, 2007 are open to further inquiry to be conducted by the Court or the Board after examining and obtaining certificate referred to sub-rule 3 of Rule 12.\t [Para 66]\n\nAn adjudication of juvenility cannot be permitted to be accepted as final until and unless it is demonstrated before the Court that the juvenility in question has been determined on the parameters as are provided for in sub-rule 3 of Rule 12 of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Rules, 2007.\t [Para 67]\n\nThe inevitable conclusion would be that where proceedings have been undertaken to make declaration of juvenile before the Board/Court in consonance with the provisions as contained under 2007 Rules and against the said decision, appeal and revision has been preferred and same has attained finality, then the said proceeding has to be accepted as final but in all other cases wherein the procedure that is prescribed for determination of age under 2007 Rules has not been undertaken, then the orders passed, determining the juvenility on the parameters of the earlier provisions, are not binding and will not have any binding effect and such an issue can be taken up in appeal at the point of time when such an issue is raised and in case, the Appellate Court finds that the determination in question is not at all in accordance with the provisions under Sub-Rule 3 of Rule 12 of the Act, then the said finding has to be ignored and the Appellate Forum is fully competent to either get further inquiry conducted on its own level on the parameters as are provided in sub-rule 3 of Rule 12. This particular opinion would subserve the cause of justice, inasmuch as, the aim and object of The Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000 is to extend the benefit to a juvenile.\t [Para 68]"
