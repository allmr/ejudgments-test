                "description": "Civil Court - Jurisdiction - Suit seeking eviction of tenants from wakf property - Can be filed only before Civil Court and not before Wakf Tribunal.\n\nThe exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts to adjudicate upon disputes whether a particular property specified in the wakf list is or is not a wakf property or whether a wakf specified in list is a Shia wakf or a Sunni wakf is clear. However, in view of S.85 of Wakf Act the Civil Court's jurisdiction is excluded only in cases where the matter in dispute is required under the Act to be determined by the Tribunal. The words \"which is required by or under this Act to be determined by Tribunal\" holds the key to the question whether or not all disputes concerning the wakf or wakf property stand excluded from the jurisdiction of the Civil Court. Whenever a question arises whether \"any dispute, question or other matter\" relating to \"any wakf or wakf property or other matter\" falls within the jurisdiction of a Civil Court the answer would depend upon whether any such dispute, question or other matter is required under the Act to be determined by the Tribunal constituted under the Act. If the answer be in the affirmative, the jurisdiction of Civil Court would be excluded qua such a question, for in that case the Tribunal alone can entertain and determine any such question. The bar of jurisdiction contained in Section 85 is in that sense much wider than that contained in Section 6(5) read with Section 7 of the Wakf Act.   [Para 15,16]\n\nSection 85 of the Act clearly bars jurisdiction of the Civil Courts to entertain any suit or proceedings in relation to orders passed by or proceedings that may be commenced before the Tribunal. It follows that although Section 85 is wider than what is contained in Sections 6 and 7 of the Act, the exclusion of jurisdiction of Civil Courts even under Section 85 is not absolute. It is limited only to matters that are required by the Act to be determined by a Tribunal. So long as the dispute or question raised before the Civil Court does not fall within four corners of the powers vested in the Tribunal, the jurisdiction of the former to entertain a suit or proceedings in relation to any such question cannot be said to be barred.   [Para 18]\n\nThere is, nothing in Section 83 to suggest that it pushes the exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts extends beyond what has been provided for in Section 6(5), Section 7 and Section 85 of the Act. It simply empowers the Government to constitute a Tribunal or Tribunals for determination of any dispute, question of other matter relating to a wakf or wakf property which does not ipso facto mean that the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts stands completely excluded by reasons of such establishment. It is noteworthy that the expression \"for the determination of any dispute, question or other matter relating to a wakf or wakf property\" appearing in Section 83(1) also appears in Section 85 of the Act. Section 85 does not, however, exclude the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts in respect of any or every question or disputes only because the same relates to a wakf or a wakf property.   [Para 21]\n\nThe crucial question that shall have to be answered in every case where a plea regarding exclusion of the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is raised is whether the Tribunal is under the Act or the Rules required to deal with the matter sought to be brought before a Civil Court. If it is not, the jurisdiction of the Civil Court is not excluded. But if the Tribunal is required to decide the matter the jurisdiction of the Civil Court would stand excluded. In the cases at hand the Act does not provide for any proceedings before the Tribunal for determination of a dispute concerning the eviction of a tenant in occupation of a wakf property or the rights and obligations of the lessor and the lessees of such property. A suit seeking eviction of the tenants from what is admittedly wakf property could, therefore, be filed only before the Civil Court and not before the Tribunal.  1993(3) Andh.L.T. 602; 2000(1) Andh.L.T. 210; 2000(5) Andh.

The order dated 18.09.2019 spells out the reason for supersession, i.e., 'A', Member of Parliament whose term came to end in May, 2019, other members of the Board as constituted were same, thus, the circumstance which has been taken as ground for supersession of the Board was not any action of the Board. The event of cessation of membership of an elected member is not under control of the Board. It was the duty of the State Government to constitute the Board as per the objectives enshrined in Section 14(4). The State Government has ample power to conduct election for the members as enumerated in Section 14(i)(b), (i) to (iv). the State Government could have very well complied with objective of Section 14(4) by conducting an election for members under Section 14(1)(b)(iii) by permitting nominated members to continue till the election is held. The State has further option to exercise power under Section 14(3) in event State was satisfied that it is not reasonably practicable to constitute an electoral college for any of the categories mentioned in sub-clauses (i) to (iii) of clause (b) of sub-section (1), the State could have then nominated under Section 14(3) which nomination shall have overriding effect on the objective of Section 14(4) since sub-section (3) begins with non obstante clause \u201cNotwithstanding anything contained in this section,\u201d. The obligation on the State Government to constitute the Board in accordance with Section 14 keeping in view the objective under Section 14(4) was both right and duty of the State and any lapse therein cannot be a ground for superseding the Board. (Paras 22, 23)\n\nThe second proviso to S.99 has to be read in conjunction with the main provision. The second proviso contains further restriction on the power of State Government to supersede the Board, i.e., unless there is prima facie evidence. There can be no dispute that prima facie evidence of financial irregularity, misconduct has to be prima facie financial irregularity or misconduct by the Board which is sought to be superseded. The third expression that is \u201cviolation\u201d of the provisions of this Act has also to be read in the same manner that is violation of the provisions of this Act by actions of the Board. In view of the legislative intendment as contained in second proviso to Section 99, present was not a case where State could have exercised its power of supersession of the Board. (Para 26)"

Thus it can be said that this section virtually repeals the Limitation Act, 1963 so far as the Wakf properties are concerned. Therefore, it can be concluded without any hesitation in mind that there is now no bar of limitation for recovery of possession of any immovable property comprised in a Wakf or any interest therein.  It is well settled that no statute shall be construed to have a retrospective operation until its language is such that would require such conclusion. The exception to this rule is enactments dealing with procedure. This would mean that the law of limitation, being a procedural law, is retrospective in operation in the sense that it will also apply to proceedings pending at the time of the enactment as also to proceedings commenced thereafter, notwithstanding that the cause of action may have arisen before the new provisions came into force. However, it must be noted that there is an important exception to this rule also. Where the right of suit is barred under the law of limitation in force before the new provision came into operation and a vested right has accrued to another, the new provision cannot revive the barred right or take away the accrued vested right.   [Para 22]\n\nSection 107 provides that nothing in the Limitation Act, 1963 would apply to any suit for possession of immovable property, comprised in any Wakf or for any interest in such property. Therefore, for the application of Section 107, on 1st of January, 1996, the property must be comprised in the Wakf or the Wakf must have some interest in such properties. If however, the right to property stands extinguished, then Section 107 cannot apply. In the present case, as noted herein earlier, the trial court had held that the suits were barred under Article 134-B of the Limitation Act, 1908 and, therefore, since the suits were barred under the 1908 Act, in view of Section 31 of the Limitation Act, 1963, Article 96 of the 1963 Act could not be applied. Section 31 was overlooked by the first appellate court. Therefore, when the right stood extinguished, Section 107 cannot have the effect of reviving the extinguished right/claim.

Procedural safe-guards laid down by the parliament for said purpose are mandatory and State is obliged to fulfill the same before effecting nominations. Reaching of a subjective satisfaction by State that it is not reasonably practicable to constitute an electoral college for any one or more of the categories mentioned in sub-clauses (i) to (iii) of clause (b) of Sub-section (1) of Section 14 and recording of reasons therefor is sine qua non. Further, persons to be so nominated have to be such as State deems fit for the post of member on Wakf Board. Hence the State is duty bound to consider even background and status of person being chosen by it. Thus there are rigourous requirements and filters; and nomination also has to be keeping in mind the importance given to elective process. Justiciability of this exercise is already commented upon by us above and has been considered in detail by this Court in its Aurangabad judgment. Thus nomination against posts to be filled in by election is only an exception. S.14 itself warrants more than 50% of total strength of Members to be democratically elected.\n\nParliament has provided \"exception\" to take care of exceptional or peculiar situation arising under Section 14(3) and that provision is not made to derogate from mandatory obligation flowing from its main part. This obligation is consistent with entire enactment itself. Parliament has highlighted it by deliberate use of words \"at all times\" in sub section (4). Thus only when in circumstances sustainable under Section 14(3), State Government effects nominations that the rule of elected members being in majority is relaxed. Such nomination instead of election is permissible also in exceptional circumstances. Thus such arrangement made to meet the rare situations cannot be used to argue that rule of elected members being in majority is not mandatory. \"Exception\" carved out in Section 14(4) proves the rule meant by parliament to operate in normal circumstances and it cannot be used to elevate said exception itself to the status of such rule. \t\t\t\t\t\t [Para 15]"

(1908), O.7 R.11 - Suit for cancellation of sale deed - Property purchased by defendant from 'A' in whose name property was standing - Plaintiff claiming suit property to be wakf property - Wakf Tribunal rejected plaint finding that suit property was not notified as wakf property in Official Gazette - High Court though agreed with finding of Tribunal, raised doubt about non-inclusion of suit property in Survey Commissioner's report and set aside order of Tribunal - Such non-inclusion was never questioned by any person including Wakf Board - Board failed to exercise jurisdiction u/S.27 of 1954 Act and S.40 of 1995 Act, though 50 yrs. have elapsed from date of gazette notification - In absence of notification as to wakf property, no cause of action arise for filing suit - Hence, rejection of plaint held proper.\n\n\tIn the instant case as held by the Tribunal as well as the High Court, the property in question does not find place in the Gazette notification published under Section 5 of the Wakf Act. In other words, the property in question is not notified in the official Gazette as Wakf property. If anybody including the Wakf Board or the plaintiff was aggrieved by such non-inclusion of the property in the list notified, the aggrieved person should have raised the dispute under Section 6 within a period of one year from the date of publication of the Gazette notification in the matter. The plaintiff has practically questioned the non-inclusion of the property in the list and the validity of the list notified in the official gazette dated 28.06.1962 after the lapse of about 50 years, i.e. in the year 2013 by filing the present suit.\n\n\tAs per Section 27 of 1954 Act (Section 40 of 1995 Act), the Board may itself collect information regarding any property which it has reason to believe to be wakf property and if any question arises whether a particular property is wakf property or not the Board after making such enquiry as it deems fit, decide the question. The decision of the Board on any question under sub-section (1) of Section 27 of 1954 Act (or under Section 40(1) of 1995 Act) shall, unless revoked or modified by the Civil Court, be final. The effect of Section 27 of 1954 Act or Section 40 of 1995 Act is that, if any property had been omitted to be included in the list of auqaf by inadvertence or otherwise, then it was/is for the Wakf Board to take action, as per said provision.\n\n\tThe Tribunal and the High Court, on facts have held that the property in question is not included in the list published in the Official Gazette as a wakf property. Such non-inclusion was never questioned by any person including the Wakf Board. The Board has not exercised jurisdiction under Section 27 of 1954 Act and Section 40 of 1995 Act, though 50 years have elapsed from the date of the gazette notification. Hence, in our considered opinion, the averments in the plaint do not disclose the cause of action for filing the suit. The suit is manifestly meritless and vexatious. \t [Para 18,19,22]"

The Survey Commissioner was duty bound to conduct the survey of wakfs in the State and after making such enquiry, as he might consider necessary, would submit his report in respect of Wakfs existing in the State to the State Government with necessary particulars. Copy of the said report would be forwarded by the State to the Wakf Board which in turn would examine the report by applying its mind and thereafter would publish the notification. Whereas under 1995 Act, the Wakf Board after examining the report forwards it back to Government within a period of 6 months for publication in the Official Gazette in the State. Pursuant thereto the State will publish the Gazette notification. The revenue authorities will consequently include list of Auqaf properties while updating the revenue records under sub-section (3) of Section 5 of 1995 Act.\n\n\tThus it is amply clear that the conducting of survey by the Survey Commissioner and preparing a report and forwarding the same to the State or the Wakf Board precedes the final act of notifying such list in the official gazette by the State under 1995 Act, (it was by the Board under 1954 Act). As mentioned supra, the list would be prepared by the Survey Commissioner after making due enquiry and after valid survey as well as after due application of mind. The enquiry contemplated under sub-section (3) of Section 4 is not merely an informal enquiry but a formal enquiry to find out at the grass root level, as to whether the property is a Wakf Property or not. Thereafter the Wakf Board will once again examine the list sent to it with due application of it's mind and only thereafter the same will be sent to Government for notifying the same in the Gazette. In the instant case since the list is prepared and published in the official Gazette by following aforementioned procedure, there is no scope for the plaintiff to get the matter reopened by generating some sort of doubt about Survey Commissioner's report. Since the surveyor's report was required to be considered by the State Government as well as Wakf Board (as the case may be), prior to finalisation of the list of properties to be published in the Official Gazette, it was not open for the High Court to conclude that the Surveyor's report will have to be reconsidered. \t [Para 16,17]"

The proviso thereunder lays down that no such suit shall be entertained by the Tribunal after the expiry of one year from the date of the publication of the list of wakfs. The result of the judgments of the Deputy Collector and the Additional Commissioner is to convert the wakf property into private property by abolition of inams and declaring respondent nos.1 to 3 as occupants. All this was done in absence of Wakf Board being party before the Authorities below. This itself becomes a sufficient ground to set aside the orders of both the authorities below.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t       [Para 16]"

In fact Government servants were also enrolled in the Home Guards to be called as and when the need arises. The voluntary nature is a basic feature of the Home Guards. The appointment letters do not suggest that they are performing duty all over the year like any Government servant. There is nothing on the record to suggest the master-servant relationship. They were appointed pursuant to Home Guard Rules, 1962 and it is made clear that their services are voluntary and will not get any pay but the duty allowance as may be fixed by the State Government from time to time. The appellants Home Guards are not entitled for regularization of service.

The classification of different premises into different categories for the purpose of fixing rates of water charges is founded on rational principles. Prescribing lower rates of water charges for premises used exclusively for residential purposes cannot by itself be regarded as discriminatory or violative of article 14 of the Constitution. Therefore Rule 1 cannot be held to be discriminatory or violative of Art. 14 of Constitution.  [Para 4]\n\nLaw is well-settled that a legislation is not to be struck down as discriminatory if any state of facts may reasonably be conceived to justify it. In order to sustain the presumption of constitutionality, the court may also take into consideration matters of common knowledge. Moreover, the presumption is always in favour of the constitutionality of enactment since it must be assumed that the legislature understands and correctly appreciates the needs of its own people and that its discriminations are based on adequate grounds. The burden of showing that the classification is arbitrary and not founded on reasonable basis is upon the person, who impeaches the law on the ground of violation of the guarantee of equal protection.\n\n(1993) 2 SCC  37 Foll.

There is no specific provision providing for any sanction to be secured for proceeding against a public servant under the 1974 Act. If one can visualise a situation where Section 197 Cr.P.C. is made applicable in respect of any prosecution under the 1974 Act and in that process the sanction is refused by the State by invoking Section 197 Cr.P.C. that would virtually negate the deeming fiction provided under Section 48 by which the Head of the Department of Government Department would otherwise be deemed guilty of the offence under the 1974 Act. In such a situation the outcome of application of Section 197 Cr.P.C. by resorting to reliance placed by Section 4(2) Cr.P.C. would directly conflict with Section 48 of the 1974 Act and consequently Section 60 of the 1974 Act would automatically come into play which has an over riding effect over any other enactment other than the 1974 Act.

According to the said Association, a large number of industries, some of them respondents before the writ court and appellants herein had indulged in dyeing and bleaching works at Tirupur area and discharging the industrial effluents into the Noyyal river which created water pollution to the extent, that the water of the river was neither fit for irrigation nor potable. The pollution also adversely affected the Orthapalayam reservoir and other tanks and channels of the said river.\n\nHeld that, the polluting industries are absolutely liable to compensate for the harm caused by it to villagers or other affected persons of the area, to the soil and to the underground water and hence, the industry is bound to take all necessary measures to prevent degradation of environment and also to remove sludge and other pollutants lying in the affected area. As the liability of the polluter is absolute for harm to the environment it extends not only to the victims of pollution but also to meet the cost of restoring the pollution free environment. The Supreme Court directed that the industries cannot escape the responsibility to meet out the expenses of reversing the ecology. They are bound to meet the expenses of removing the sludge of the river and also for cleaning the dam. The principles of \"polluters-pay\" and \"precautionary principle\" have to be read with the doctrine of \"sustainable development\". It becomes the responsibility of the members of the Industries Association that they have to carry out their industrial activities without polluting the water.  \t\t\t\t\t [Para 15,27]"

Section 49 embraces cognizance of all offences under the Act. Whether the offences are covered by Section 47 or 48 has no bearing on the power of the Court to take cognizance of an offence. Karnataka State Pollution Control Board has filed complaint for taking cognizance specifically referring to Section 49 of the Act, 1974. Thus, in event any offence is committed by anyone, its cognizance can be taken under Section 49. Offences by a body corporate are to be covered by Section 47, since in event offences by body corporates are not covered by Section 47, the benefit of Section 47(1) proviso shall not be available to those body corporates, which cannot be the intention of the Legislature.

This Award would also not be qualified to be termed an agreement. Reason is discovered in the definition of the term \"settlement\" given in Section 2 (p) of the ID Act. It defines settlement as inclusive of an agreement arrived at betweenthe employer and the workmen otherwise than in the course of conciliation proceeding, if such an agreement has been signed by the parties in a prescribed manner and its copy has been sent to an authorized officer.\n\n\tWhen examined from this angle, Manisana award would also not answer the description of the agreement which is included in the meaning assigned to the word \"settlement\" under the ID Act. The reason is that it is in the nature of recommendations made applicable by an order of the Central Government and is not a document signed by the employer and the workmen and published in a prescribed manner. \n\n\tOnce it is found that the recommendations of Manisana Award, though by an order issued and notified under Section 12 of the Act of 1955 by the Central Government have been made applicable to the establishment of the petitioner with effect from 1.4.1998, do not constitute either an award or settlement or agreement as contemplated under item 9 of Schedule IV to the Act of 1971, the inevitable corollary is that any failure to implement these recommendations would not amount to any unfair labour practice as contemplated under Item 9. Here, there is no award or settlement or agreement which could be implemented and no failure that could be counted for as an unfair labour practice under the Act of 1971. The enforceability of the Wage Board recommendations, termed as Award, would have to be made by resorting to remedy available elsewhere and not under the Act of 1971. \n\n(2015) 11 SCC 204, 1990 ALLMR ONLINE 717 (S.C.)

Such a suit filed by the landlord against the tenant for recovery of possession, therefore, cannot be referred under Section 8 of the 1996 Act to arbitration. In fact, subsection (3) of Section 2 of the 1996 Act expressly provides that Part-I which relates to 'arbitration' where the place of arbitration is in India shall not affect any other law for the time being in force by virtue of which certain disputes may not be submitted to arbitration. Section 6 of the Tenancy Act is one such law which clearly bars arbitration in a dispute relating to recovery of possession of premises by the landlord from the tenant. Since the suit filed by the appellants was for eviction, it was a suit for recovery of possession and could not be referred to arbitration because of a statutory provision in Section 6 of the Tenancy Act. \n\n(1981) 1 SCC 523 Rel.on.

Under the Working Journalists Act gratuity can be denied if the service is terminated as a punishment inflicted by way of disciplinary act, as has been done in the instant case. Section 5 of the Working Journalists Act being a special law will prevail over Section 4(6) of the Payment of Gratuity Act which is a general law. Section 5 of the Working Journalists Act is only for working journalists, whereas the Payment of Gratuity Act is available to all employees who are covered by that Act and is not limited to working journalists. Hence, the Working Journalists Act is a special law, whereas the Payment of Gratuity Act is a general law. It is well settled that special law will prevail over the general law. The special law, i.e., Section 5(1)(a)(i) of the Working Journalists Act, does not require any allegation of proof of any damage or loss to, or destruction of, property, etc. as is required under the general law, i.e., the Payment of Gratuity Act. All that is required under the Working Journalists Act is that the termination should be as a punishment inflicted by way of disciplinary action, which is the position in the case at hand. Thus, if the service of an employee has been terminated by way of disciplinary action under the Working Journalists Act, he is not entitled to gratuity.  [Para 10,11]"

Unless and until the document produced before the Industrial Court was identified as a consent certificate issued by the competent authority for the purpose of reference which Industrial Court was adjudicating, the Industrial Court could not have proceeded further with adjudication of the controversy.

Section 11-A of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, added to the statute in September 1984, provides that the award shall be made under Section 11 of the said Act within a period of two years of the declaration under Section 6 of the Act and if no award is made within the said period, the entire process for acquisition shall stand lapsed. In the case at hand the acquisition proceedings had started before the insertion of Section 11-A in the statute book. Proviso to Section 11-A would therefore apply and permit the making of an award within a period of two years from the date the Land Acquisition (Amendment) Act 1984 came into force. The said amendment came into force on 24th September, 1984. In terms of the proviso, therefore, the award in respect of the acquisition at hand could have been made till September 1986, by the latest. No such award was however made till September 1986 or at any time even thereafter till 2011, when the Collector did so, pursuant to the direction of the High Court. That award is on the face of it non-est in the eyes of law. The net effect of the above is that the entire process commencing with the publication of the Notification under Section 4 and declaration under Section 6 had lapsed and no award could be lawfully made or directed to be made by the High Court in exercise of its power under Article 226 of the Constitution of India. Inasmuch as learned Single Judge directed a decision to be taken by the competent authority it could only mean that the competent authority would be free to initiate the process of acquisition rather than taking the lapsed proceedings further by making an award beyond the statutory period. Inasmuch as the Division Bench directed compensation to be determined that too by appointing a special officer for that purpose, it fell in a palpable error.  [Para 9,10]"

                ],
                "description": "Release of seized vehicle - Accused borrowing vehicle on pretext of going to see his ailing father - Owner of vehicle was not in vehicle at time of checking and was not an accused in the case - Four persons occupying vehicle arrested and vehicle and contraband seized - Held, S.50 as amended did not in any way affect the Magistrate's power to make order of interim release of vehicle under S.451 of the code - Section 39(d) cannot be used against exercise of power to release vehicle during pendency of trial.\n\nTo contend that the use of a vehicle in the commission of an offence under the Act, without anything else would bar its interim release appears to be quite unreasonable. There may be a case where a vehicle was undeniably used for commission of an offence under the Act but the vehicle's owner is in a position to show that it was used for committing the offence only after it was stolen from his possession. In that situation, it is difficult to see why the vehicle should not be released in the owner's favour during the pendency of the trial.  Section 50 and the other provisions in Chapter VI cannot be said to exclude the application of any provisions of the Code. It is indeed true that Section 50 of the Act has several provisions especially aimed at prevention and detection of offences under the Act. For example, it confers powers of entry, search, arrest and detention on Wild Life and Forest Officers besides police officers who are normally entrusted with the responsibility of investigation and detection of offences; further sub-section (4) of Section 51 expressly excludes application of Section 360 of the Code and the provisions of Probation of Offenders Act to persons eighteen years or above in age. But it does not mean that Section 50 in itself or taken along with the other provisions under Chapter VI constitutes a self-contained mechanism so as to exclude every other provision of the Code. This position becomes further clear from sub-section (4) of Section 50 that requires that any person detained, or things seized should forthwith be taken before a Magistrate.  The expression used in the sub-section is \"according to law\" and not \"according to the provisions of the Act\". The expression \"according to law\" undoubtedly widens the scope and plainly indicates the application of the provisions of the Code.   [Para 15,16,17]\n\nThe effect of deletion of sub-section (2) and its replacement by sub-section (3-A) may be summed up thus : as long as, sub-section (2) of Section 50 was on the Statute Book the Magistrate would not entertain a prayer for interim release of a seized vehicle etc. until an application for release was made before the departmental authorities as provided in that sub-section. Further, in case the prayer for interim release was rejected by the departmental authority the findings or observations made in his order would receive due consideration and would carry a lot of weight before the Magistrate while considering the prayer for interim release of the vehicle. But now that sub-section (2) of Section 50 stands deleted, an aggrieved person has no option but to approach the Magistrate directly for interim release of the seized vehicle.   [Para 18]\n\nThe provision of Section 39(1)(d) would come into play only after a court of competent jurisdiction found the accusation and the allegations made against the accused as true and recorded the finding that the seized article was, as a matter of fact, used in the commission of offence. Any attempt to operationalise Section 39(1)(d) of the Act merely on the basis of seizure and accusations/allegations levelled by the departmental authorities would bring it into conflict with the constitutional provisions and would render it unconstitutional and invalid.  The provisions of Section 39(1)(d) cannot be used against exercise of the Magisterial power to release the vehicle during pendency of the trial.  2007 ALL MR (F.B.) - Approved of.\t\t\t\t\t\t     [Para 22]"

The section begins with a non obstante clause providing that notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time being in force in a State, no State Government or other authority shall make, except with the prior approval of the Central Government any order of the nature enumerated in the provision. Section 3 of the Conservation Act deals with constitution of Advisory Committee and S. 4 deals with powers to make rules. Rules 4, 5 and 6 of the Forest Conservation Rules, 1981 (in short 'Conservation Rules') are relevant. Rule 4 deals with procedure to make proposal by a State Government or their authority. Rule 5 deals with the powers of the Committee to advise on proposals received by the Central Government. The Committee referred to therein is the one constituted under S. 3 of the Act. Rule 6 deals with action of the Central Government on the advice of the Committee. Admittedly, the Central Government has not accorded the approval for use of any forest land or any portion thereof for being used for any non-forest purpose. That being so Rule 29(b) of the Mineral Rules cannot be of any assistance to the company. So far as the order dated 14-11-2000 in W.P. No. 337/2000 is concerned, it is clear therefrom that de-reservation of forests, sanctuaries and national parks was prohibited. Therefore, exclusion of company's land in terms of the Notification under S. 35(4) of the Act though same was being used for mining by the company, was not in order to that extent.

The property seized under Section 50(1)(c ) and Section 50(3A) has to be dealt with by the Magistrate according to law. This is made clear by Section 50(4) which provides that things seized shall be taken before a Magistrate to be dealt with according to law. Section 54 substituted by Act 16 of 2003 does not empower the specified officer to deal with the seized property. In this view of the matter, a comparative reading of pre-amended Section 54(2) and Section 54 (2) as substituted by Act 16 of 2003 makes the legislative intent clear that seized articles shall not be forfeited on composition of the offence under the 1972 Act. When the language of the statutory provision is plain and clear no external aid is required and the legislative intention has to be gathered from the language employed. Neither Section 54(2) of the 1972 Act by itself nor Section 54(2) read with Section 39(1)(d) or any other provision of the 1972 Act empowers and authorizes the specified officer under Section 54, on composition of the offence, to deal with the seized property much less order forfeiture of the seized property used by the person suspected of commission of offence against the Act. \t\t\t\t    [Para 39]\n\nIn view of the above, the order passed by the Conservator of Forests, for forfeiture of the vehicle and two rifles to the state government is de hors the provisions of the 1972 Act and unsustainable. The High Court has rightly set aside such illegal order. However, the Single Judge was not right in directing the respondents therein (present appellants) to release the vehicle and rifles. The Division Bench also erred in maintaining the above direction. Since the items were seized in exercise of the power under Section 50(1)( c), the seized property has to be dealt with by the Magistrate under Section 50(4) of the 1972 Act. The respondent nos. 1 to 3 must accordingly apply to the concerned Magistrate for the return of seized items who obviously will consider such application according to law.    [Para 40]"

Divine approbation being the essential in the constitution of a Wakf if the object for which a dedication is made is sinful, either according to the laws of Islam or to the creed of the dedicator it would not be valid.\" This shows that a non Muslim can also create a Wakf for any purpose which is religious under the Mohammedan Law. However, the object of the Wakf must be lawful according to the religious creed of the maker as well.   [Para 17]\n\nBy notification dated 13.11.1959 issued under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition Act, 1894, the Chief Commissioner of Delhi proposed acquisition of 34070 acres land including 872 bighas and 17 biswas land of appellant for planned development of Delhi excluding the following categories of land:\n\n(a)\tGovernment land and evacuee land;\n\n(b)\tthe land already notified under Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act for any Government Scheme;\n\n(c)\tthe land already notified either under Section 4 or 6 of the Land Acquisition Act, for House Building Co-operative Societies mentioned in Annexure III;\n\n(d)\tthe land under graveyards, tombs, shrines and the land attached to religious institutions and Wakf property.\n\nHowever, in the present case the evidence shows that even after the so called dedication of land for charitable purposes, the same continued in the name of the dedicator a Hindu till 1936 when he executed the release deed in favour of the Trust of which he himself was the founder trustee apart from being the Manager of the school and the President of the Society. The hawan ceremony performed by said dedicator which was preceded by Samarpan and Sankalp also shows that he did not intend to create a Wakf. In the deed of settlement executed by the British Government, the institution was described as a public educational charity and not as a Wakf. Therefore, the concurrent finding recorded by the Single Judge and the Division Bench that what was created by Rai Sahib Kedar Nath was a public charitable trust and not a Wakf and the property acquired vide notification dated 13.11.1959 was not a Wakf property and hence not exempted under said notification for acquisition under S.4 of Land Acquisition Act.

In other words, the property in question is not notified in the official Gazette as Wakf property. If anybody including the Wakf Board or the plaintiff was aggrieved by such non-inclusion of the property in the list notified, the aggrieved person should have raised the dispute under Section 6 within a period of one year from the date of publication of the Gazette notification in the matter. The plaintiff has practically questioned the non-inclusion of the property in the list and the validity of the list notified in the official gazette dated 28.06.1962 after the lapse of about 50 years, i.e. in the year 2013 by filing the present suit.\n\n\tAs per Section 27 of 1954 Act (Section 40 of 1995 Act), the Board may itself collect information regarding any property which it has reason to believe to be wakf property and if any question arises whether a particular property is wakf property or not the Board after making such enquiry as it deems fit, decide the question. The decision of the Board on any question under sub-section (1) of Section 27 of 1954 Act (or under Section 40(1) of 1995 Act) shall, unless revoked or modified by the Civil Court, be final. The effect of Section 27 of 1954 Act or Section 40 of 1995 Act is that, if any property had been omitted to be included in the list of auqaf by inadvertence or otherwise, then it was/is for the Wakf Board to take action, as per said provision.\n\n\tThe Tribunal and the High Court, on facts have held that the property in question is not included in the list published in the Official Gazette as a wakf property. Such non-inclusion was never questioned by any person including the Wakf Board. The Board has not exercised jurisdiction under Section 27 of 1954 Act and Section 40 of 1995 Act, though 50 years have elapsed from the date of the gazette notification. Hence, in our considered opinion, the averments in the plaint do not disclose the cause of action for filing the suit. The suit is manifestly meritless and vexatious. \t [Para 18,19,22]"

The Survey Commissioner was duty bound to conduct the survey of wakfs in the State and after making such enquiry, as he might consider necessary, would submit his report in respect of Wakfs existing in the State to the State Government with necessary particulars. Copy of the said report would be forwarded by the State to the Wakf Board which in turn would examine the report by applying its mind and thereafter would publish the notification. Whereas under 1995 Act, the Wakf Board after examining the report forwards it back to Government within a period of 6 months for publication in the Official Gazette in the State. Pursuant thereto the State will publish the Gazette notification. The revenue authorities will consequently include list of Auqaf properties while updating the revenue records under sub-section (3) of Section 5 of 1995 Act.\n\n\tThus it is amply clear that the conducting of survey by the Survey Commissioner and preparing a report and forwarding the same to the State or the Wakf Board precedes the final act of notifying such list in the official gazette by the State under 1995 Act, (it was by the Board under 1954 Act). As mentioned supra, the list would be prepared by the Survey Commissioner after making due enquiry and after valid survey as well as after due application of mind. The enquiry contemplated under sub-section (3) of Section 4 is not merely an informal enquiry but a formal enquiry to find out at the grass root level, as to whether the property is a Wakf Property or not. Thereafter the Wakf Board will once again examine the list sent to it with due application of it's mind and only thereafter the same will be sent to Government for notifying the same in the Gazette. In the instant case since the list is prepared and published in the official Gazette by following aforementioned procedure, there is no scope for the plaintiff to get the matter reopened by generating some sort of doubt about Survey Commissioner's report. Since the surveyor's report was required to be considered by the State Government as well as Wakf Board (as the case may be), prior to finalisation of the list of properties to be published in the Official Gazette, it was not open for the High Court to conclude that the Surveyor's report will have to be reconsidered. \t [Para 16,17]"

In fact Government servants were also enrolled in the Home Guards to be called as and when the need arises. The voluntary nature is a basic feature of the Home Guards. The appointment letters do not suggest that they are performing duty all over the year like any Government servant. There is nothing on the record to suggest the master-servant relationship. They were appointed pursuant to Home Guard Rules, 1962 and it is made clear that their services are voluntary and will not get any pay but the duty allowance as may be fixed by the State Government from time to time. The appellants Home Guards are not entitled for regularization of service. Further, in absence of any comparison of duties, responsibilities, accountability and status, they may not be equated with the Police Constables or personnel to claim parity with the pay or scale of pay as provided to the Police personnel.

The only difference between the provisions of Chapter-III of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, and Rule 3 of the Works of Licensees Rules, 2006, is that the disputes in respect of sufficiency of amount of compensation would go to different authorities. Chapter-III of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, provides forum of the District Court, whereas the above Rules provide forum of the Appropriate Commission. It is required to be mentioned that the Appropriate Commission is also empowered to decide disputes that are referred to it in similar fashion as that is done in the Civil Court. Sections 86, 94 and 95 of the Electricity Act, 2003, provides functions, powers and procedure of the Appropriate Commission.\tThus, there is a clear impression created by the provisions and the events that have taken place in this case that the petitioners were in a position to choose either of the forums. \t\t           [Para 10,11]\n\nThe order passed by the authority under Rule 3 of the Works of Licensees Rules, 2006, is assailable before two forums. Since the powers under the provisions of Sections 10 and 16 of the Telegraph Act are still conferred on the licensee-company, the provisions of Sections 10 and 16 of the Act are still in realm. As said above, even the provisions of Rule 3 of the Works of Licesees Rules, 2006, are equally holding the field as far as similar dispute is concerned. There is no provision in the Electricity Act, 2003, which provides exercising such powers under Section 164 conferring the powers under Chapter-III of the Indian Telegraph Act, 1885, to the authorities under the Electricity Act, 2003. In fact, Section 175 of the Electricity Act, 2003, very clearly mentions that the provisions of the Act are in division and not in derogation of any other law.

Thus, if it is in occupation of the owner himself, permission should be taken from the owner and if the owner is not in actual physical possession, permission should be taken from the lawful occupier of the land or building and not from the owner. The Rules do not provide for deciding any dispute between the owner and the lawful occupier on the question whether the occupation of such occupier is lawful or not. The Rules, on the other hand, prescribe the procedure for resolving the dispute between the licensee in one hand and the owner or the occupier on the other, regarding alteration of work or fixation of support etc. or payment for compensation by the Licensee to the owner or the occupier, as the case may be. By the word \"lawful occupier\" introduced in the Rules, the legislature intended to mean the \"actual occupier in settled possession\" of the property and the licensee is required to take the permission of such a person in settled possession of the property if the property is not in possession of the owner.
